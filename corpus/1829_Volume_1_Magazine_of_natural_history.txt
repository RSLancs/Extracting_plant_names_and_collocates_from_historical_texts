PREFACE. 



The First Volume of the Magazine of Natural History is submitted 
to its readers, as a fair specimen of what that Periodical is intended 
to be ; subject, however, to such improvements as may, from time 
to time, suggest themselves to its Conductor. 

The Introduction (p. 1.) describes the objects it proposes to 
embrace: — 1. A more general diffusion of a knowledge of Ani- 
mals, Vegetables, and Minerals, technically and physiologically ; 
of their commixture and disposition under the earth's surface, or 
Geology; and their disposition over it in the atmosphere, as Land- 
scape scenery. 2. A record of discoveries in these branches of 
knowledge ; and of the actual state and progress of the taste for 
Natural History, in different parts of the British empire, and 
throughout the world. 3. A summary of the progress of discovery 
in natural science during the past year. 

In conformity with these objects, original communications, in- 
troductory to Linnean Botany, will be found, p. 124'. 228. and 
429. ; to Jussieuean Botany, p. 30. 135. 238. and 333. ; to Zoology, 
p. 97. and 309. ; to Ornithology, p. 121. ; to Entomology, p. 421. ; 
to Geology, p. 249. and 442. ; to Meteorology, p. 147. ; and to 
Landscape scenery, p. 37. and 242. Of new facts or theories, it is 
not to be supposed that many can have occurred, or come to our 
knowledge, since this Magazine has been in existence ; but the 
discoveries of Professor Nees von Esenbeck, M. Franz Unger, and 
others, on the Metamorphoses of the Reproductive Bodies of some 
A'lgXy p. 306. ; the researches of Mr. Brown, M. Brongniart, and 
M. Raspail, on the particles of the Pollen of Plants, and on the 
ultimate particles of matter in general, p. 473. ; and of Dr. Mar- 
tins, on the Structure of Plants, p. 475. ; have been recorded, or 
noticed, preparatory to more complete details. 

The Miscellaneous Intelligence and Collectanea of this Maga- 
zine (see Contents, p. vi.) contain a various assemblage of original 
communications, and extracts from published works, detailing the 
local state and progress of Natural History in the different coun- 
ties and cities of Britain, in North and South America, in Australia,

and in other parts of the world. In these two departments of 
the work, as well as among the Original Communications, will be 
found numerous fragments of information, presented in various 
forms and combinations, with a view to keep alive the interest of 
the general reader ; and gradually, and in an agreeable manner, to 
store his mind with facts. 

With respect to an Annual Summary of Discoveries, after con- 
sulting some of the principal naturalists of France and Germany, 
we are convinced it is impossible to do this as we intended; viz. to 
give those of every year at its termination ; because, the materials 
for the year cannot be got together for weeks, or even months, 
after the year is completed. The attempt, we are informed, has 
been made without success ; and we are not sure that we shall run 
the risk of having our efforts added to the number of failures. At 
any rate, we shall not attempt such a summary for the year about 
to be completed, till an advanced period in the next year ; and, in 
the mean time, if our readers do not calculate on receiving any 
further summary in future Volumes than what can be given in such 
a Preface as the present, they will, at least, not be disappointed. 
They may rely, at the same time, on our being sufficiently alive to 
our own interest, not to neglect such a summary if it shall be 
found practicable, and can be done well. We date this Preface 
from the city of Naturalists, and the best sources of information 
on all that relates to Natural History.

THE MAGAZINE 

OF 

NATURAL HISTORY, 



MAY, 1828. 



INTRODUCTION. 



JLn order to point out the agreeableness and utility of the 
study of Natural History, we shall commence by taking it 
for granted, that all knowledge is pleasure as well as power. 
If any man doubts this, we refer him to the first page of Mr. 
Brougham's Preliminayy Discourse on the Objects, Advantages, 
and Pleasures of Science, In this Introduction, we shall chiefly 
endeavour to show that the pleasure and the power obtained 
will be in direct proportion to the labour bestowed. 

To know any thing does not consist in having merely seen 
it, or in recollecting its name; no naturalist can be said to 
know a plant, unless he knows its ' rank in the vegetable king- 
dom, its structure, habits of growth, the climates and countries 
in which it abounds, its history in its wild state, and, if a 
cultivated plant, its domestic history, its culture, properties, 
and uses. 

The tulip and the ranunculus are known to every body, 
and are deservedly two of the most admired productions of 
professional florists. There is no child who cannot name 
them at sight, and no gardener who does not know a great 
deal about their culture : but how few, among either gardeners 
or botanical amateurs, know that these two plants, however 
nearly they may be . allied as fine flowers, are very different 
in point of rank in the scale of vegetable creation ; that they 
belong to separate fundamental divisions of plants, the or- 
ganisation of the one being much more perfect than that of the 
other; and that they display wholly different characters of 
structure and physiological economy, from the seminal em- 
bryo through every stage to the perfect plant! Thus the 
ranunculus, belonging to a division of plants characterised 

Vol. I. _ No. 1 . b 



2 INTRODUCTION. 

by a reticulated structure of all their parts, admits of portions 
of its leaves being broken off, without impeding the remain- 
der of the leaf in the performance of its functions; while 
the tulip, belonging to a division characterised by a parallel 
fibrous structure of all the parts, does not admit of part of 
the leaves, and particularly of their extremities, being cut off, 
without impeding their functions, and consequently injuring 
the present health of the plant, and influencing its vigour 
for the following year. But any one who is so far a vegeta- 
ble anatomist and physiologist as to know the distinctive 
structures of these two divisions (Monocotyledoneae and Di- 
cotyledoneae), if he should see only a part of the leaf of a 
tulip or of a ranunculus, would be able to ascertain the divi- 
sion to which it belonged, and, by consequence, the essential 
principles of the culture and management of the plant, as far 
as respects the most important organs of plants, leaves being 
analogous to the lungs of animals. 

Such is the difference between knowing a plant as a gar- 
dener or an amateur, and knowing it as a physiologist. 
There must evidently be a superior degree of pleasure in 
combining both descriptions of knowledge, and as evidently 
an advantage in point of utility : for though the mere culti- 
vator might be aware of the effect of cutting or mutilating 
the leaves of the tulip and ranunculus from experience in 
the management of these two plants, yet not knowing it from 
principle, the knowledge could only be of use to him in this 
particular case, instead of being of use as applied to two of 
the three grand divisions of the vegetable kingdom. 

There is a positive source of pleasure in knowing the 
species of plants individually. Every plant of which we 
acquire a knowledge by sight, so as to be able to recog- 
nise it again when it comes in our way, is not only a dis- 
tinct source of pleasure at first, but the pleasure is repeated 
and increased when we see it for the second and third 
times, or after some time, or in other circumstances re- 
latively to ourselves or to the plant. In this way, with no 
other knowledge of plants than that of being able to name 
them when we see them, and, consequently, to commu- 
nicate our ideas respecting them to others, they may prove 
sources of the most interesting associations. But even 
this pleasure, derived from what may be termed the trivial 
knowledge of plants, may be greatly enhanced by extending 
our views to circumstances connected with them not strictly 
botanical. Thus we may view them with regard to their geo- 
logical relation in any particular country, their geographical 
distribution relatively to the world, their migration from one 



INTRODUCTION. 



country to another, their relation to climate, their being do- 
mestic plants following man, their being social (growing in 
masses) or solitary, their being abundant or rare, their na- 
tural modes of propagation, their natural enemies or friends 
whether among other plants or among animals, their history 
with regard to man, and their properties, uses, and culture. 

A mere general lover of plants, therefore, who knows no 
more of them, in a strictly botanical sense, than their names, 
may add greatly to the pleasure which he derives from this 
taste, by simply acquiring something of that knowledge 
which may be called the biography of plants. It must be 
evident that cultivators, by adding to their stock of this de- 
scription of knowledge, would not merely add greatly to their 
enjoyments, but would also contribute to their professional 
improvement, would add to their power as well as to their 
pleasure. 

Those of us who know nothing of scientific zoology, 
still derive much pleasure from observing the great variety of 
forms, habits, and powers of the animal kingdom ; and nothing 
is more common than for man to form attachments to parti- 
cular animals. We transfer the human virtues to some of 
the nobler quadrupeds, and admire the courage of the horse, 
the sagacity of the dog, the docility of the ox, the patience 
of the ass, and the observant mimic powers of the monkey 
tribe ; we are delighted with the singing of birds, instructed 
by the industry of the bee or ant, pleased with the gaiety of 
the butterfly, and amused or annoyed by various other insects 
or reptiles. But what is this interest in animated nature 
compared with the enjoyments of a scientific zoologist? The 
man who can trace the powers of the Author of nature, ex- 
erted in various degrees and for various purposes, through 
all the different orders of animated nature, from the most 
minute insect or obscure moUusca, endowed with unerring 
instinct, up to the intellectual powers of rational man, and who 
knows scientifically that man is the most perfectly formed of all 
animals, lives in a different world from the mere general 
observer, and enjoys that more exalted pleasure which can 
be given by scientific knowledge only. 

Nor need the young student, who aspires to become a 
zoologist, be discouraged from attempting to obtain his share 
of the superior delight scientific knowledge can afford, by the 
obstacles that apparently oppose the acquirement. Every 
step in the pursuit produces a reward and a gratification, in 
exact proportion to its difficulty ; and every advantage thus 
gained becomes a fresh inducement to proceed. The geo- 
graphical distribution of the various animated beings which 

B 2 



4 INTRODUCTION. 

surround him, invests each untried locality with new charms, 
and presents to him, on all sides, fresh objects to repay his 
researches. Their forms, habits, powers, and structure are all 
so many indices to the great work he is every day invited to 
peruse. 

To point out to the learner the most proper objects of at- 
tention, or the best mode of arriving at a competent know- 
ledge of^ their various peculiarities, does not come within the 
limits of the present Introduction ; yet the gradations observed 
in the great field of animated nature indicate the preliminary 
steps for the commencement of his operations. 

The occasional and sometimes alternate developemenL of 
internal and external organisation, each division advancing in 
the degree of its perfection as the animal rises higher in the 
scale, seems to indicate the natural order of progress. The 
slow and creeping- caterpillar sinks into a state "of lethargy, 
ultimately to burst forth with organs and powers of loco- 
motion the most opposed to its former condition. 

Fishes, reptiles, and birds furnish additional examples of 
an adaDtation of parts, admirably suited to the exigencies of 
the animals, yet possessing and affording capabilities of the 
most opposite character ; and the rudiments of extremities 
furnished to the cetacea, become ultimately perfected in ani- 
mals of the same class, for the individual but opposite powers 
of climbing, burrowing, flying, prehension, and speed. 

Thus agreeably led on, the zoologist is brought by degrees 
to the contemplation of man, the image of the Creator of all ; 
and finds that, although man does not in himself possess all 
the different qualities of the organs of each individual beneath 
him, yet he presents, in the varied and extensive combination 
of his powers, that balance of perfection, which, independently 
of mental endowment, stamps him the head of his own as 
well as of every other class. 

The study of mineral bodies is of the greatest importance : 
for what would civilised man be without iron ? The different 
ores, and the various useful or precious stones, display great 
variety in structure, colour, and other 'properties. Many 
species are highly beautiful, others are prized for their rarity, 
and all are interesting with reference to crystallography, 
systematic arrangement, and the useful arts. The study of 
mineralogy is intimately connected with that of geology ; and 
the utility of both, in the discovery and working of quarries 
and mines, is sufficiently evinced by the stones and metals 
which enter into the construction of our houses, roads, 
machines, and implements. 



INTRODUCTION. 5 

An acquaintance with the leading facts of geology adds greatly 
to the interest of the traveller in passing through any country. 
Whether mountain or plain, hill or valley, solid rock or 
detached stone, gravel, sand, or alluvial soil presents itself, 
the mind of the geologist is carried back to former revo- 
lutions ; in short, to him every part of the earth's surface may 
be said to speak of its history. How. much greater, then, 
must be the pleasure of the geologist than that of the common 
observer ! The ploughman, who views in the field of gravel 
which he turns up the bed of a former ocean, and. in that 
gravel the remains of rocks or mountains of a more remote 
period, is he not gratified with the mere idea? How many 
interesting associations are connected with the fossil remains 
which the labourer turns up in digging drains or ditches, or 
crushes to pieces in the humble occupation of breaking stones 
for mending roads ! Geology not only discovers to us the aw- 
ful revolutions which have in former ages changed the surface 
of the globe, but it unfolds to our view the forms of strange and 
unknown animals buried in the different strata, presents us 
with the zoology and botany of the former world, and even 
enables us to contemplate the nature of the future revolutions 
which the globe we inhabit is destined to undergo. 

Some knowledge of meteorology, as it regards the weather, 
is common to all men without exception ; but even to this 
everyday subject, science has lent additional interest. It is one 
thing to look at the clouds with a common eye, and another 
thing to observe them with the eye of a Forster or a Howard. 
The countryman and the sailor know to expect in March and 
September the equinoctial gales, but the meteorologist knows 
the reason of their occurrence at these seasons. When we 
consider what has been done, or is now doing, by lightning 
rods, hail protectors, marine barometers, &c., the utility of 
this science is much greater than at first sight may appear. 

The common phenomena of thunder, lightning, meteors, 
hail, rain, snow, frost, dew, fog, and vapour, by our taking a 
little pains to increase our information respecting them, are 
all capable of affording increased degrees of interest and plea- 
sure. And let the learner never forget, that in the pursuit of 
pleasure, as in every other pursuit, the amount of gratification 
will always be in proportion to the labour employed. 

Notwithstanding the very limited knowledge which exists 
among country people of the objects of natural history, as 
a science, it is certain that this must have been one of the 
earliest subjects of human attention, from the necessary 
dependence of man on certain plants and animals for food, 
and from the influence which the weather and climate must 

B S 



6 INTRODUCTION. 

have had on his dress and the construction of his dwellings 
In different countries and climates, different animals and. 
plants would attract his attention ; but in all countries the 
first objects of human solicitude must have been animals, 
plants, the soil, and the weather. The study of natural his- 
tory, therefore, is the most primitive and congenial of studies ; 
as gardening and agriculture, arts which are founded on it, 
are the most primitive and congenial of occupations. As 
these arts are the preliminary occupations in new countries, and 
as the first step in the civilisation of savages is to supply them 
with useful plants, animals, and implements of culture, so the 
study of natural history, the observation of the habits and 
peculiarities of plants and animals, is the fittest to commence 
with, and the best calculated for improving uninformed minds. 

The study of natural history we consider to be in an 
especial manner calculated for raising the character of the 
labouring classes of a community. It may be said to be a 
study which they have, to a certain extent, already engaged 
in ; it requires less preliminary information than any other 
study, and cannot by any means be considered dry or severe, 
since it requires habits of observation chiefly, and every step 
is likely to be attended by some acquirement intimately con- 
nected with, and beneficial in, the pursuits of a country life. 
The humblest and most laborious individual, after fulfilling 
all his duties to his employer and his family, has still a portion 
of leisure ; and with him, as with man in every class of society, 
happiness will be found to depend much more on the manner 
in which this leisure time is spent, than on the nature of his 
professional or mechanical occupation. But not only does 
the happiness of the laborious classes depend on the manner 
in which they spend their leisure time, but also their chance 
of raising themselves to a higher condition in society. The 
pursuits of natural history, besides their suitableness to the 
former object, are, it is obvious, particularly adapted for ad- 
vancing the interests of gardeners and agricultural labourers. 

The study of natural history is well calculated to have a bene- 
ficial influence on the moral sentiments and conduct. While 
various other descriptions of knowledge are cultivated to im- 
prove the reasoning powers of the mind, their influence on the 
heart and affections is com})aratively remote. Natural history 
has a different effect, and may be said to improve and humanise 
the whole man. It is perfectly natural to man to regard with 
affection the living things which surround him ; and every 
one must feel that the better these things are known, the 
more they will be loved. If man born and educated in cities 
has less interest or affection for animals and plants, than man 



INTRODUCTION. 7 

born and educated in the country, it can only be because in the 
latter state he is more familiar with them, and knows more about 
them. The connection between moral conduct and the love of 
animals and plants, may be thought intimate or remote by 
different individuals ; but the more we trace design and pur- 
pose in the works of nature, shall we not sympathise the more 
with the fitness of means to ends in human conduct? The 
more we enter into the details of nature, shall we not in- 
crease our taste for facts ? which is, in other words, the love of 
ti'uth, thefoundation of justice and honesty. It is unnecessary 
to trace the influence of the study of natural history from 
individuals to nations, and its tendency to universal inter- 
course, civilisation, and peace. For these reasons, amongst 
many others, the study of natural history is particularly 
adapted for the earliest education of young people ; and this 
idea is confirmed by the rapid progress which children make 
in this study whenever it has been considered a fitting 
acquirement. Infants, who have made but little progress 
in languages or sciences of reasoning and reflection, have 
yet made considerable progress in the observation and re- 
collection of natural objects. 

Natural history is the parent of natural religion. To 
know and to acknowledge the Author of nature, are precepts 
inculcated by the religion and morality of every civilised people ; 
and the history of the world shows that most nations have had 
someway of what they considered knowing God, and some par- 
ticular reasons which they assigned for loving and reverencing 
him. Without interfering with that knowledge of God which 
is obtained by revelation, or with those reasons for loving him 
which are deduced from the doctrines of particular religions, 
natural history arrives at a knowledge of the Author of nature, 
by enquiring into the skill and contrivance manifested in his 
works, calls forth our affections towards him in loving those 
of his works which contribute to our happiness, and leads us 
to adore him in the contemplation of the superhuman power 
and wisdom displayed in the general system and particular 
contrivances of the world and its various details. " He," ob- 
serves Linnaeus, " who does not make himself acquainted with 
God from the consideration of nature, will scarcely acquire 
knowledge of him from any other source ; for if we have 
no faith in the things which are seen, how should we believe 
those things which are not seen?" * , 

For this reason, the knowledge of the Author of nature, 
through his works, may be called the universal religion, as the 

* Reflections on the Study of Nature, p. 21. 
B 4 



8 INTRODUCTION. 

love of fitness, induced by a taste for facts, may be called the 
universal morality. Neither interferes with the religion or 
morality of any particular country, climate, or people. 

An extended knowledge of natural history will not take 
place without producing corresponding improvements in taste, 
literature, and the elegant arts. A knowledge, in readers and 
spectators, of natural forms and appearances, will demand 
a greater accuracy in the delineation of them by the artist 
and the man of letters. The public taste in painting, sculp- 
ture, and architecture is gradually improving; and no in- 
considerable part of the improvement will be found to consist 
in the more correct representation of natural objects. The 
same improvement in taste has extended to our different 
manufactures, and especially to the figures printed on cotton, 
paper, and earthenware ; the superiority in these and other 
articles of British manufacture, is acknowledged to consist, in 
a great degree, in a more correct imitation of plants, animals, 
and general scenery. 

Such are the pleasures and advantages of the study of 
natural history. The main object of this Magazine is to ren- 
der a taste for this study more general among all classes of 
society.' In order to extend it among readers of leisure and 
general observation, and also among gardeners, farmers, and 
young persons resident in the country, we propose to 
subject every part of the science to discussion; to invite 
every reader to communicate every circumstance, even the 
most trivial, respecting the native habits and economy of ani- 
mals, the habits and habitations of plants, the localities of 
minerals and strata, and respecting peculiar or striking states 
of the atmosphere ; to encourage all who are desirous of in- 
formation, to propose questions, to state their doubts, the kind 
of information they desire, or their particular opinions, on 
any part of the subject. Observations which, at first sight, may 
appear trivial, are often truly valuable when viewed in refer- 
ence to general conclusions ; and this kind of information may 
be furnished by persons wholly unacquainted with natural 
history as a science, but who, by such exercises, are adopting 
the most certain and efficacious means of becoming scientific 
observers. In this way we hope to call forth a new and numer- 
ous class of naturalists. 

We intend, also, for the benefit of such as have never paid 
any attention to the elements of natural history, to give a 
series of introductory papers in each of the five departments ; 
and after these are completed, to give a general view of the 
subjects of each department. These papers will necessarily 
extend through several volumes ; but they will, in the end, 



INTRODUCTION. 9 

display an introduction to natural history, in what we consider 
to be by far the most desirable form and manner of publication 
for giving effect to our intentions. 

Our second object is, to collect scattered facts and new dis- 
coveries. Individuals are now occupied in every part of the 
globe, in discovering new objects, or in explaining the nature 
of those already known. New productions and new facts are^ 
thus rapidly accumulating; it shall be our business to record 
them as they are discovered or ascertained, and at the end of 
every year to present their essence to our readers in a general 
summary 

If we can attain these two objects in the manner in which we 
hope to do, whoever makes himself master of our introductory 
papers, and regularly peruses the other parts of the Maga- 
zine, will, for all the ordinary purposes of use and enjoyment, 
be a practical and scientific naturalist ; will know all that is 
already known, and worth remembering, on the subject, and 
be made acquainted with every thing new or interesting as it 
occurs. 

In conclusion we repeat, with a view of impressing them on 
the mind of the young reader, the fundamental truths with 
which we set out ; first, that all knowledge is pleasure, as well 
as power; and secondly, that in the pursuit of pleasure, as in 
every other pursuit, the reward obtained will be commensurate 
with the labour bestowed. These are facts in accordance 
with reason and experience, and ought to be treasured up in 
the mind of every young person, as perpetual incitements to 
exertion.

Art. I. Some Remarks on Natural History, as a Means of 
Education.. By J. E. B. 

It has been the fashion, in modern times, to depreciate the 
discoveries of Linnaeus, and to put forward other eminent na- 
turalists as rivals for popular favour at his expense. Nothing 
can be more unjust towards the memory of departed greatness, 
nothing can be less acceptable to existing merit, than the at- 
tempt to build up their fame by disparaging that of another. 
Now, although it must be acknowledged that the naturalists 
of this country have confined their studies too exclusively to 
the nomenclature of science, and have overlooked too much 
the end for which language is invented, let us not be so 
absurd as to shut our eyes to the real merits of Linnaeus, 
because we have witnessed some abuses of his system. His 
great claims to our admiration rest upon ground independent 
of that which is generally taken up against his disciples ; and 
tliis will be found tenable against all opposition, whatever the 
extent or novelty of our discoveries or improvements in our 
systems. 

The first great merit of Linnaeus consisted in the sound 
philosophy on which he framed his genera. This invention 
of generic characters, though not his own, was brought to 
such a degree of perfection by him, and was rendered current 
by his instrumentality to such an extent, that h'3 is entitled to 
the high praise of having made it useful to the world. Before 
his time, natural history consisted of a multitude of particulars 
spread over so large a surface, that it was impossible to em- 
brace them without devoting a whole life to the subject. By 
the simple invention of generic terms, the mind is enabled to 
comprehend and speak of all these particulars in an abridged 
form. That is done by one word, which before required a 
hundred. It may safely be asserted, that the application of 
this metaphysical instrument, familiar as it now appears, has 
facilitated the acquisition of the knowledge of nature more 
than any thing besides. It is to the intellect what the steam- 



Natural History, as a Meafis of Edticatioii, 1 1 

engine is to mechanics — a highly compressed form of power, 
enabling us to do in a minute, and with infinitely less fatigue, 
what before consumed an hour. 

Systematic terms, of a generic character, are now become 
so common, that naturalists seem to have forgotten the great 
importance which is attached to them. The subject, of which 
they formed a part, engrossed nearly all the learning of the 
latter part of the seventeenth century. It engaged the atten- 
tion of Locke, Leibnitz, Descartes, and, more or less, of all 
the master-minds of the age. Hume pronounces the discovery 
of the real nature of these abstractions to be the greatest 
and most important which has been made in modem times in 
the republic of letters. These philosophers treated the subject 
metaphysically ; Linnaeus showed its application to practice. 

It is very true that the English, who have a metaphy- 
sical turn peculiar to northern latitudes, and were among the 
first to adopt this prodigious concentration of intellectual 
strength, have, in dwelling upon the engine itself, thrown away 
some time in a less profitable application of it; yet this is 
better than the abuse of it by some of our more southern 
neighbours, who are frittering away the power, by breaking 
down and dividing substantial genera, until they have almost 
reduced them to particulars again. Sound philosophy, on 
the contrary, requires, that, as our knowledge of particulars 
increases, the generalisation of them should increase also. 

This is the proper business of the present generation. Our 
forefathers have laboured to accumulate the particulars of 
natural history, until they are become so redundant as to be 
beyond the grasp of human thought. The only mode by 
which they can be reduced within our power, is the just appli- 
cation of the laws of generalisation, by persons standing pre- 
eminent in science, and entitled to prescribe to inferior minds. 
It is a small and paltry ambition which has inflamed the or- 
dinary naturalists of the present day, that they should wish to 
impose their own names ; that they should be mortified to find 
themselves forestalled in their barbarous compounds ; and that 
their boast should be in the number of these spurious ofi^- 
spring that may be affiliated upon them. 

Besides the placing of genera on a philosophic foundation, 
we are indebted to Linnaeus for the invention of a language of 
such precise import as almost to supersede the necessity of a 
draughtsman ; and also for the application of trivial names, 
which is but another mode of generalising. 

Whoever will look into the old authors, will see what a 
wonderfld facility is given to the acquirement and communi- 
cation of knowledge by this simple contrivance. For instance, 



1 '2 Some Remarks on Natural History, 

Ray, ill writing or speaking to his friend Willoughby, to tell 
him he had found Antirrhinum ^latine (the former being the 
generic, and the latter the trivial name), is obliged to go 
round to his point in this manner: — " I have found that 
Linaria Elatine dicta folio acuminato ;" and Haller, who 
was one of the neatest and most sl<ilful definers, if he had 
communicated the same information, would have employed 
this periphrasis : — "1 have gathered the Antiirlmium foliis 
imis conjugatiSi superioribus alternis, ad basin hamatis" 

But the knowledge of the instrument, however requisite, is 
not the knowledge of the subject to which it is applied. No- 
menclature is not the end, but the means, of our study; and 
if I have offered an excuse for the attention which has been 
paid to it in this country, I rejoice in any circumstance which 
is likely to enlarge the boundaries of science, and throw open 
still wider the temple of nature. The establishment of a 
Magazine of Natural History cannot fail to promote this 
object. 

Without disparaging other pursuits, the subject has some 
advantages of a wider bearing than is generally acknowledged. 

In the first place, it is admirably adapted to develope and 
strengthen the faculties of the mind; and this it does, not 
only by the system and order which are necessary to be ob- 
served, but by appealing to some of the higher powers with 
which we are endowed. Mankind are evidently divided into 
two great classes, those who particularise (composing the 
bulk), and those who generalise. No man was ever great, 
without possessing both faculties in an eminent degree ; yet 
the greater part pass through life without ever discovering that 
they have this power of abridging and condensing thought by 
an operation of the mind alone. Even those who do possess 
the faculty to some extent, are apt to suffer it to run so wild, 
and to deal in such loose generalities, that they lose half its 
benefits. Nothing is more likely to develope this peculiarity 
of the intellect, or to keep it within legitimate bounds, than 
the systematic study of nature. She furnishes such an infinity 
of subjects, that no man could grasp the ten-thousandth part 
who should attempt to become acquainted with all the indi- 
viduals, and he would be left immeasurably behind another 
who should employ generic and family distinctions. Nor can 
the student of natural history make a step in generalisation 
without a frequent recurrence to his particulars. He would 
soon find himself lost amidst the mazes of similar and related 
things, if he were not to examine and reexamine the indi- 
viduals before him. Unlike many of the subjects of the pre- 
sent day, which seem to. owe their attraction to the almost 



as a Means of Edtwation. 13 

licentiouaness of their generalisation, this subject brings with 
it its own corrective; and to be a good naturalist, requires 
that the student should be a diligent observer of particulars, 
as well as a correct generaliser of them. 

Another great inducement to adopt the study of natural 
history, is, that it is admirably suited to correct the tendency 
there is in our popular institutions to run into schemes of 
utility. Our niechanics, mathematics, amusements, politics, 
charities, are all tainted, more or less, with this defect. "The 
age of chivalry is gone; that of sophisters, calculators, and 
economists has succeeded." Now, besides this perpetual ap- 
peal to utility and reason, as the only, or chief foundation of 
happiness, there is another and higher appeal, felt by all, and 
occasionally bowed to by all, which goes to the heart and to 
the affections; more subtle in its nature, and less within con- 
trol, there are a thousand cases which yield to no other tribu- 
nal, and where man acts with greater safety, trusting to the 
dictates of his heart, than if he relied upon utility and reason. 
To bring the subject home more practically : our scheme of 
popular education attempts to improve man's moral condition 
almost entirely through the medium of his understanding. It 
seems to be adapted to make good artizans, skilful mechanics, 
industrious tradesmen ; but it may be fairly doubted, whether 
it be suited, in a like degree, to cherish the higher virtues, 
and to make men better as well as wiser. 

I wish to see natural history cultivated as a means of 
enlarging this contracted view of education, of opening to the 
little sentient new objects for his affections and sympathies, of 
awakening within his bosom a love for nature and nature's 
productions. It is the fashion with a cold and heartless por- 
tion of the world, to stigmatise these notions with the names of 
romance and sentiment. It might, perhaps, be happier for 
England, not forgetting Scotland, if the sinews of our strength 
were not wholly exhausted in our industry ; if steam-engines, 
and power-looms, and economy, and profit, divided our atten- 
tion only, — things which reason approves, but which the ima- 
gination forbids. They have a tendency to lower the standard 
of excellence to their own level, while the repudiated and now 
antiquated scheme of bettering men through the heart, always 
proposes a higher and nobler standard than he can reach. 

I should, for instance, propose, that the peasantry of 
England should be improved by being tayght that the kitchen- 
garden does not comprehend the whole scope of horticulture ; 
that there are such things as violets and roses to awaken 
sweet recollections ; ranunculuses and anemones to ravish the 
eye; and some one or other particular flower, which every 



14 Obset'vatio7is oti the Cmcses that have retarded 

man of imagination associates with tenderness and friendship. 
In passing along through the country, every man*s garden 
may furnish a chie to his character, much better and safer, in 
my esteem, to trust to, than either physiognomy, phrenology, 
or autography. Do we see the kail bed of large and ample 
dimensions, encroaching upon every inch of cultivated soil, 
we pronounce the possessor to be a political economist, or 
radical, or voluptuary ; on the other hand, iF we witness flowers 
of all hues adorning the vicinity of his habitation, we know 
there is a spark of his better nature yet unextinguished. It 
unfolds to us the current of his thoughts and feelings ; it tells, 
like the other also, of honesty and industry ; but it tells, be- 
sides, of generosity and charity, love and fidelity, of brave 
sons and beautiful daughters. 

I lately was made acquainted with a rustic of this latter 
class, whose house botanists are wont to frequent for the 
beauty of the surrounding scenery, and the rare plants to be 
found in the neighbourhood, a house that Isaac Walton 
might have delighted in. One of the last acts of this honest 
vintner's life, was to call his daughter to his pillow, when he 
said, " Mary, it is a fine morning ; go and see if AScilla v^rna 
is come in flower." May the virtues of the father descend upon 
his children ! Then may botanists continue to find at this 
humble inn *, cleanliness and civility, a trowel to dig up their 
plants, and even a vasculum to secure them, J. E. B.

There is no country that has the same facilities for pro- 
curing objects of natural history from every region of the 
globe as Great Britain ; there is no country where larger 
sums of money have been expended to purchase them ; and 
yet there is no country in the civilised world, where there are 
fewer facilities ofTerea to the student of natural history than in 
England. 

The truth of this remark cannot be denied. The two 
causes which have mainly contributed to impede the study of 

? The Running Horse, at Micklehani. 



the Progress of Natural Histoi-y in this Countty. 15 

natural history in England may be briefly stated : the first is, 
the deplorably ineffective state of our public museums; the 
second is, the very expensive form in which works on natural 
history are generally published in this country. The total 
amount of the money expended in collecting objects of natural 
history for the British Museum, is, perhaps, one hundred 
times greater than the sum expended in forming the museum of 
natural history at the Jardin des Plantes, at Paris ; and yet the 
utility of the latter, to the student of natural history, may be 
fairly said to exceed that of the former, in the ratio of a thousand 
to one. The British Museum is the property of the nation, 
having been bequeathed to the public, or purchased and sup- 
ported with the public money ; but, till recently, the public 
had great difficulty in obtaining access wdthin its walls ; and 
when it was at length opened on certain days, the admission 
was rather granted as a favour, than conceded as a right. 
The value of the admission to the student of natural history 
was greatly diminished from the want of a scientific arrange- 
ment of the objects ; particularly in the zoological department. 
The defects were those of its original formation. The inten- 
tion appears to have been to collect whatever was extraor- 
dinary or rare, without any view to arrangement : it was an 
assemblage of curiosities, some of which, as single objects, 
were highly interesting to the professed naturalist, but con- 
veyed little instruction to the learner. 

After the Greville collection had been purchased by the 
nation, at a considerable price, a part of the minerals were 
arranged and exhibited ; and the mineralogical department, 
as far as regards simple minerals, is, perhaps, as well classed 
as the space allowed for it would admit of. Yet, as a useful 
collection, it is still defective. Many of the specimens are 
without labels, and they consist chiefly of the more rare crys- 
tallisations of each species, whereas to be really useful, a, public 
collection ought to cont-ain specimens of each mineral, in the 
most common form in which it usually occurs, as well as the 
rare crystalline forms, which are only to be found in par- 
ticular situations. 

It is more than twelve years since I was induced to 
expect that a scientific arrangement of the shells would be 
undertaken ; but after visiting the museum for ten years, I 
could perceive no progress made in such a labour, and I 
discontinued my visits, as there appeared every probability 
that the presejut generation would pass away before it was 
accomplished. There were, indeed, some cases, with shells 
placed to amuse the spectator by the splendour of their 
colours, or the beauty of their forms ; but there was no sys- 



1 6 Obse7'vatfons on the Causes that hax)e retarded 

tematic arrangement of them, nor were the shells labelled or 
described. This is the more to be regretted, as conchology 
has risen into importance, from its connection with geology. 
How different is the museum at the Jardin des Plantes at 
Paris, where each genus and species of shell is arranged and 
numbered according to a received system ; and the student 
has only to exit* "ae the collection with his book in his hand, 
to render himseir' master of the science, as far as books and 
specimens can teach him ! This defect in the department of 
conchology in the British Museum is to be lamented, as I 
know of no public collection in this country, from which the 
student can derive any assistance. Surely the curators of the 
British Museum, who superintend this department, would do 
well to recollect the maxim of Hippocrates, " Ars longa, vita 
brevis." 

It has been too long supposed that the nation had nothing 
to do with the British Museum, but to furnish funds for its 
support. I hope, however, that the present liberal and en- 
lightened president of the Royal Society, whose zeal for the 
promotion of science is well known, will feel that he is in trust 
for the benefit of the nation, and that he will make all the re- 
sources of the British Museum more available for the purpose 
of public information, than they have yet been. It is particu- 
larly desirable, as the London University will speedily be 
opened, that the collections in every department of natural 
history in the British Museum, should be well arranged, and 
scientific catalogues published at a reasonable price. If this 
were effected, it would be - of greater benefit to the students 
than the establishment of lectureships on natural history in the 
university, as those who had a real desire to learn, would be 
able to instruct themselves as at Paris. 

In offering these remarks, I can sincerely affirm that they 
are not dictated by any feeling of hostility, but by an ardent 
desire to see the scientific institutions of our- own country 
rendered as respectable and efficient as those in various parts 
of Europe ; and I am certain, that if they are not so at pre- 
sent, it is neither from want of talent or ability, but arises 
from a kind of national reluctance to disturb the slumbers of 
ancient establishments by innovation, even where innovation 
would be attended with the most favourable results. 

The Ashmolean museum at Oxford offers an excellent 
illustration of what ancient museums were intended to be. 
Their founders never contemplated the formation of scientific 
arrangements of natural objects for the i)urpose of study ; but 
they collected whatever was strange, curious, or rare in nature 
or art, to surprise or amuse the spectators. In doing so they

are entitled to our gratitude, as they preserved many things 
that were valuable and interesting, which would probably have 
been lost or destroyed, had they been scattered over the 
country in the possession of private individuals. I by no 
means wish that such collections should not be preserved, 
but the present advanced state of science requires, nay, impe- 
riously demands, something more ; and it * much to be 
regretted, that in London we have no weL arranged public 
collections of objects in the different departments of natural 
history, that can materially assist the researches of the 
student.* 

The second cause which has greatly impeded the study of 
natural history, namely, the expensive publications on the 
subject, might be easily remedied, if the public taste would 
give encouragement to books in a cheaper form. I am 
no enemy to splendid editions, and superb plates: noble- 
men and opulent individuals do well to encourage the arts as 
well as the sciences ; but I see no reason why persons of 
moderate fortune should not be able to procure books on 
natural history, at a reasonable price, in this country, as well 
as in France. In the latter country one of the most perfect 
systems of zoology, Le Regne Animal, distribue d^apres son 
Organisation ; ov. The Animal Kingdom, arranged according to 
its Organisation, by Baron Cuvier, may be purchased for about 
twenty shillings. This work, which contains a most lumi- 
nous arrangement of the whole animal kingdom separated 
into four grand divisions, is intended as a text-book for the 
student, and is replete with more scientific information, than 
any work in our own language published at five times the 
price. I have long regretted that Cuvier*s system, and also 
his interesting discoveries respecting fossil bones, should be 
so little known to the English reader; and, therefore, it is 
my intention to supply this information by a series of essays 
in succeeding Numbers of this Magazine. The classification 
of Cuvier is founded on the organisation of animals, and 
what he denominates " the conditions of existence ; or, 
the immutable laws prescribed to living beings by their 
Creator." By making his system more generally known, 
I am persuaded that I shall render an acceptable service 
to the English reader. B.

Gavin Milrot/, Esq. Edinburgh. Communicated by P. Neill, 
Esq. M.A. F.R.S.E. Sec W. S. 

The living specimen of >Slmia Jacchus {Jig. 1.), Ouistiti, or, 
as it is called by the English in South America, Mamozeet 
Monkey, which has been in my possession since last June, I 
procured from a slave in the streets of Bahia (the capital of the 
province of San Salvador in Brazil), to which place this and 
many other kinds of animals are brought from the country 
for sale. At first it was exceedingly fierce and wild, screech- 
ing most vehemently when any one dared to approach it. I 
was about to sail for England, and took it with me on board 
of our vessel immediately. I laid in a few oranges, bananas, 
mangoes, and Indian corn, to feed it with during the voyage. 
A little kennel or box was made, where it slept, or retired 
when frightened. It was long before it was so reconciled, 
even to those who fed it, as to allow the slightest liberty in 
the way of touching or patting its body; and it was almost 
impossible to do this by surprise, or by the most quiet and 
cautious approach, as the monkey was not steady a moment, 
but was constantly turning its head round from side to side, 
eyeing every person with the most suspicious and angry look; 
its sense of hearing appeared to be excessively acute^ so that 
the slightest whisper was sure to arouse it. The voice of this 
little animal was peculiarly sharp and disagreeable, consisting 
of a very quick succession of harsh and shrill sounds (imitated 
in the name ouistiti), so loud, that they might be heard from 
the remotest part of the ship. 

To give a long description of the external appearance 
of the animal is quite unnecessary, as the present specimen 
corresponds in every particular with the descriptions of natu- 
ralists, and agrees very well with those I have seen preserved 
in museums. It is the smallest, 1 believe, of the iSimia 
tribe, its body not being quite so large as that of a squirrel ; 
the prevailing colour is a lightish brown, edged with grev ; 
the hair on the head and tail is considerably darker, . and the 
latter is very beautifully barred with circular bands of a 
lighter hue ; but what is characteristic of this species is, the 
cluster or patch of white elongated hairs which stand out' 
before the ears, and give a curious appearance of antiquity to 
the little animal ; so much so, indeed, that it received the appel- 
lation of ** the little old man*' from the sailors. The external 
ears are peculiarly large find capacious, but are nearly hid in the 
long hair ; the size of the concha, no doubt, contributes to the 




Simla Jttcchus, Lin., or Jacchus xmlgatis, Geoff. 19 

acuteness of its hearing. For a considerable time there was 
no evident change in its habits, as it continued to be nearly as 
wild as when I first got it, and showed none of the playful- 
ness and vivacity which characterise most of the monkey tribe. 
As long as the fruit which he had on board lasted, it would 
eat nothing else ; but when these failed, we soon discovered a 
most agreeable substitute, which it appeared to relish above 
every thing. By chance we observed it devouring a large 
cockroach which it 

had caught, run- ^- ^ '^^ '^^^'^ -^^^saasiffliyi/yTi^ i 
ning along the deck 
of the vessel ; and 
from this time to 
nearly the end of 
the voyage, a space 
offour or five weeks, 
it fed almost exclu- 
sively on these in- 
sects, and contri- 
buted most effect- 
ually to rid the 
vessel of them. It 
frequently eat a score of the largest kind, which are 2 or 
2^ in. long, and a very great number of the smaller ones, 
three or four times in the course of the day. It was quite 
amusing to see it at its meal. When he had got hold of 
one of the large cockroaches, he held it in his fore paws, and 
then invariably nipped the head off first ; he then pulled out 
the viscera and cast them aside, and devoured the rest of the 
body, rejecting the dry elytra and wings, and also the legs of 
the insect, which are covered with short stiff bristles. The 
small cockroaches he eat without such fastidious nicety. In 
addition to these, we gave him milk, sugar, raisins, and 
crumbs of bread. Hitherto the weather was warm, the ther- 
mometer being never below 65° or 60° Fahr. ; but as we 
reached a more northern latitude, and approached England, 
the change of temperature affected the monkey very sensibly; 
his appetite failed very considerably, and now he would not 
even touch the cockroaches when given to him; the hair, 
especially that on the tail, fell off; and, at the end of the 
voyage, this organ was almost quite bare and naKed. He 
kept constantly in the kennel, rolling himself up in a piece of 
flannel, which had been put in for warmth, except when he 
could reach a sunny part of the deck, where he might bask in 
the heat. There was a considerable continuance of cold north- 
easterly winds, the thermometer as low as from 42° to 36®

Fahr., and, as the monkey eat little or nothing, and was quite 
mactive, I hardly expected to have kept it alive. 

When I got it on shore, I kept it for some days in a warm 
room ; it gradually recovered its nimbleness, running about 
the room, and dragging its kennel after it. Even then it 
would not eat any insects, and its food consisted of milk and 
crumbs of bread ; it was particularly fond of any sweet pre- 
serve, as jelly, &c., and of fresh ripe fruits. From London I 
brought it with me to Edinburgh last November, and have 
kept it here till now. During all this time it has thriven 
perfectly well ; it is considerably plumper than it was, and the 
tail is now completely covered with long darkish hair. 

I observe in Linnaeus*s description of this animal, he says 
it is a great enemy to cats ; so far, however, is this from being 
the case with the present one, that it feeds and sleeps with 
puss, and they live on the best terms imaginable. 

Though jiow it is much tamer than it was, it is by no means 
tractable or docile ; it will allow itself to be patted or gently 
stroked, but all attempts to handle or play with it are quite 
unsuccessful. When teased or enraged, it exhibits a most 
ludicrous physiognomy of passion ; the white hairs or whis- 
kers on its cheeks are erected ; it grins and shows its teeth ; it 
dilates its nostrils, and the little eyes beam with the most 
passionate fury : it only wants the power of speech to embody 
its feelings, to represent most faithfully a true picture of anger. 
Though it does not possess any of that imitative playfulness 
which is so amusing in many of the jSimiae, there is a some- 
thing, an air of intelligence, a look of observation, which we 
search for in vain in those animals lower in the zoological

Canaan Cottage, near Edinburgh. By Alex. J. Adie, Jan. Esq. 

The Mangouste, Fiverra M/ingo Lin. {fg. 2.), which has 
been in my possession for about twelve months, is one of a 
family of four which were taken on board at Madras. This 
was the only one that reached England, the other three 
having died during the voyage. It has as yet borne the 
rigours of our northern latitude well, but it is a little subject 
to a cough in cold damp weather. The animal is a female, 
now between two and three years old. It measures in length 
2 ft. including the tail, which is 1 ft. Its colour, when viewed 
at a little distance, is a silvery giey ; but a closer inspection

shows thac each hair, which is long and coarse, is composed 
of bars of black, brown, and white, exactly resembling the 

2 




quills of a porcupine. The head is small and very handsome; 
the legs are strong, the fore ones much tapered, having five 
separate toes on each foot ; the tail is very long, thick at the 
root, and tapering to a point. 

It uses its fore paws with much dexterity; pulls every 
thing into the cage that comes within their sphere of action, 
takes insects out of water with them, and when a snuffbox is 
presented to it, by the rapidity of their motion, expels much 
of the contents before the box can be shut. It does not take 
its prey with the claws, but they prove powerful weapons in 
tormenting it when caught, by throwing it from one place to 
another. The tail seems to assist the animal in leaping and 
turning, as in doing so it frequently strikes it against hard 
objects with such force as to cause it to bleed at the extremity. 

Its curiosity is unbounded. When let loose in a room it 
traverses it at a light, airy, and graceful pace, its feet scarcely 
appearing to touch the floor; it searches every corner, and 
kills all insects that are to be found. After the floor has 
undergone a minute examination, the chairs and tables follow 
next ; these it easily reaches, being able to leap three feet from 
the ground, and sometimes the pockets of those present 
undergo the same scrutiny. The mangouste knows the house 
and garden of Canaan Cottage so well, that it runs about 
from the one to the other, but never goes away, and appears 
at the call of those it knows. Myself and another are the 
only persons it has complete confidence in ; it distinguishes 
my foot at a great distance and runs to me : its powers in 
this way are very acute. I have seen it set its hair on end 
and growl when a strange dog was some yards from it, the 
one being within and the other without the house; with the 
dog that belongs to the house, it has been on terms of friend- 
ship ever since the first interview, when, after giving him a 
bite on the face, a good understanding was estabhshed, and 

c fi 



22 Notice of the Habits of a Mangoustc. 

since that time the dog has sometimes used it very roughly 
without the mangouste resenting it. Should a stranger take 
hold of it when out of the house it bites and runs off. 

The mangouste is as docile as the mildest of our dogs, if 
you except the time of feeding, particularly when devouring 
a bird that has been given to it alive. At this time the change 
in its manners is as quick as it is remarkable : in one second 
it loses all the mild and attractive dispositions of the pet ; 
these vanish, to be replaced by the repulsive ones of the 
fiercest carnivorous animals, growling, uttering a sharp bark, 
and even attempting to bite. 

Its favourite food is small birds, and the dexterity shown in 
climbing into bushes, seems to indicate that in the wild state 
they may probably constitute a considerable portion of its 
food. If a mouse, rat, lizard, or frog be given it, before 
killing it will play with the animal for a quarter of an hour : 
indeed I do not remember having allowed this to be carried 
on so long as it might have been disposed ; and to put an end 
to it, the rescue of the victim has only to be attempted, when 
its death is instantaneous. With a small bird, however, the 
treatment is very different, for the mangouste has only to see 
one, when capture and death will follow in a second. If, 
however, we except the time of feeding, the harshest usage 
from those it knows will only make it utter a low, plaintive, 
and murmuring cry. It cries in the same way when hungry, 
or when wishing to get out of its cage. 

Its playfulness is very remarkable ; it is more playful than 
a kitten, with strength and agility superior to that of a cat. 
It is impossible to describe the numerous positions it twists 
its body into ; perhaps the most marked of them is that of 
standing on the hind legs and leaping like a kangaroo. 

As it is mentioned in various books on natural history, 
that the mangouste can dive, swim, and remain long under 
water, like the otter, for the purpose of taking fish ; in order 
to try if this one possessed the same faculty, I put an egg 
into a large basin of water, and showed it to the mangouste ; 
immediately the animal dived its body up to the shoulders 
and took out the egg. A few minnows were then put into a 
small basin ; it took them with great ease and avidity ; but 
it could not take them out of a larger basin, the water seem- 
ing to deprive it of sight, as soon as its head was plunged 
under the surface ; it preferred to watch till they came to the 
edge, and pounce on them; but these attempts proving as 
abortive as the first it abandoned them altogether. Since 
that time several birds have been put into a small pond, but 
the mangouste would not go into the water for them.

Art. V. Some Remarks on the Habits of the Kingfisher. By 
S. T. P. of Leeds. 

It has been justly observed by an accomplished naturalist, 
that there are few facts, however isolated, however trivial they 
may respectively appear, more conducive to the illustration 
of the history of animals, than those which relate to their 
habits. I am induced, therefore, to send for insertion, in any 
Number of your forthcoming Magazine of Natural History, 
some particulars relating to the habits of the kingfisher {AX- 
cedo I'spida, (fig. 3.) which I do not find mentioned in any 
English ornithological work. Indeed, the editor of the last 
edition of Pennant's British Zoology says, " the kingfisher 
seldom flies much, or far from its haunt," but the facts I am 
about to state bear a different aspect. 

Early in the month of October last, while passing a short 
time on our southern coast, and within half a mile of the sea, 
I was agreeably surprised by ^ 

the sudden appearance of great 
numbers of kingfishers, in a 
country where I had previously 
observed only an occasional 
example. On enquiry, I found 
that these birds regularly makep 
their appearance on that coast 
in October, and as regularly de- 
part in the following spring. Of 

this, the occurrences of last month furnished some proof. A 
collector of birds for London preservers sent notice that the 
kingfishers had returned to the banks of the Thames, in his 
neighbourhood, and in one week he fm-nished eighteen spe- 
cimens, the production of his own gun, though they are well 
known to be one of the most difficult birds to shoot. 

These birds lay six or seven eggs, nearly round, tinged 
with a most delicate pink colour, from the influence of the 
yolk pervading the transparent: albumen and thin shell ; they 
have, moreover, a much larger air-bag (folliculus aeris), than 
is to be found in any other British bird's egg^ in proportion 
to its size. It is well known that the eggs of birds, deposited 
in their nests on the ground, contain a larger quantity of air 
in the receptacle, than those placed in nests upon trees ; and 
the young of the former are invariably produced in a much 
more perfect state (supposed to be owing to the influence of 
the greater portion of oxygen), than the young of the latter, 
which remain helpless and naked for several days, while the 
young of the former are covered with down, and able to quit

the nest with part of the shell on their back ; a beautilul pro- 
vision of nature in favour of those wiiich are most assailable 
by enemies. 

Mr. Bewick remarks, that " kingfishers are not so numer- 
ous as might be expected from the number of eggs found in 
their nests ; owing, probably, to the young being destroyed 
by floods, which must often rise above the level of the holes 
where they are bred." Whether the still greater quantity of 
air assists in rendering the young kingfishers at their birth 
more competent to encounter this additional risk, I am unable 
to state. The departure of these birds to the coast, on the 
approach of cold weather, may be accounted for on the sup- 
position, that instinct has taught them that they are less likely 
to be deprived of their food, by the effects of diminished tem- 
perature, near large bodies of salt water : but some of your 
readers may probably suggest other reasons and better.

Art. VI. Fanciful Ideas for a National Museum of Shells. 

By CONCHILLA. 

Sir, 
As your Magazine seems to embrace every branch of 
natural history, I venture to lay before you the plan of a 
national museum of shells, so contrived as to have a high 
metaphysical relation to society in general. That shells are 
capable of as much I will endeavour to show ; and in order 
to prepare myself at least a serious hearing, I beg you to 
reflect upon the importance which, at different times, has, by 
all nations, been attached to shells. How can any man de- 
spise a shell, when he reflects how many heroes of old were 
not only content to quaff nectareous draughts in shells in ho- 
nour of their mistresses, but also to pour from them libations 
to the gods themselves ? How many of the poets also "tune 
the vocal shell?" And more than all, the classic scholar will 
find, that even the most gallant of the ancients allowed Venus 
herself nothing more than a shell for a car. I have been led 
particularly into these reflections from a tour which I lately 
made through Holland. During my progress it was my good 
fortune to visit Scheveningen, the little sea-port of the Hague, 
where I employed the greater part of the day very agreeably 
in the examination of a cabinet of shells. These were cer- 
tainly neither rare nor arranged in a very scientific manner ; 
but there was altogether a novelty in their disposition which 



Fajiciful Ideas for a Museum of Shells, 25 

exceedingly delighted me. They were neither strewed upon 
tables, labelled in glass cases, nor arranged in the drawers of 
a cabinet ; but so disposed as to form statues of men and 
women, some of them as large as life. But as the ancient 
feast (I think it was Philopoemen's), notwithstanding the great 
variety of dishes it contained, was still nothing but hog ; so 
these, notwithstanding the variety of forms in which they 
appeared, were all the while nothing more than Dutch. 

1 would have mine a gallery applicable to all men, since I 
would have these characters familiar to them all. The elo- 
quent man of genius should be formed from shells of the Ph5- 
las {pholeo, to seek a hiding place ; habitat) kind {fg, ^,aa a),

since we are told that that little animal, with its tongue alone, 
is found to penetrate even into the hearts of rocks themselves; 
it is found also to contain an illuminating property that dark- 
ness cannot resist : and are not these characteristic of true 
eloquence and true genius ? Perhaps to form such a charac- 
ter I might be found borrowing also from the Helix {heileo, 
to twist round ; shell spiral, or with circumvolutions of the

ticulturist may advance to his disadvantage, I confess that I, 
who am little of a botanist, can never see a snail in my path 
without feeling for him sentiments of more than ordinary 
respect and consideration. When I behold his telescopic 
eye, I always think of a man of science ; and when I see the 
dignity with which he supports the whole weight of a house 
of which he is himself the architect, I cannot, in my own mind,

help giving him a much higher place in the scale of animals 
than any naturalist has yet assigned him. Besides these, we 
conchologists have otherwise, for the adornment of the 
learned and accomplished, our Cyi^Ycea [Cypris, one of the 
names of Venus) arabica (fg. 4. c); our musics, Voliita {voliUa, 
a volute; form) musica (the surface resembling musical scores) 
[fig. 4. dd)\ our harps, Voliita harpa (ribs like the strings of the 
harp) [fig. 4. e) ; and our Conus (konos, a cone ; form ) ammi- 
ralis {fig. 4.y) ; while, for the designation of rising merit, 
'we can offer the cradle-formed Chiton {chitd?i, a coat of

rora, {fig. 4. h.) For the depiction of the profoundly heavy, 
and the heavily profound, (for you know, Mr. Editor, there 
are such in the literary world,) we would employ the Chama

session, its weight being often six or seven hundred pounds !

scraps stolen from the labours of others, should be indebted 
for his garments to the Sabella {sabulum, fine sand or gravel ;

nasteries of Great and Little St. Bernard), of whom we are told 
by honest Isaac Walton, has no shell of his own, otherwise 
it might well aid in the representation of him, who, though 
prone and forward to assert, is deficient in argument, and 
therefore has recourse to that of others, in order to defend 
himself; for, as we are informed by the above-mentioned 
author, whenever this curious animal is attacked, he always

leaps into another shell, and in that way defends liiniself. 
Minute philosophers, such as those who have spent much 
time and pains in teaching mankind how a bee's leg is jointed, 
or what species of circulation is carried on in the viscera of 
that little animal which inhabits a fly's head, &c. &c., I would 
designate by microscopic shells {fig. 5.b); while my fossil ones 
( j%. 5. ccc) should be laid apart for the adornment of the an- 
tiquary and the geologist, to whom we are indebted for them.

of this latter character, could not, I think, be better delineated 
than by the Serpulae {serpulla, a serpent; form) {fg. 6.f), 
who fix themselves and their shells so firmly upon those of 
larger and more powerful Testacea {testacetis, having a shell), 
that no effort of these latter can shake them off; so there they

shells of the iSpondylus {spondylos, the prickly head of an

and the cockle (fg. 6. /), might very well denote those per- 
sons whom one meets with in society every day, and who are 
so tremblingly alive to little matters which regard precedence 
and respect : for naturalists inform us that the scallop, which 
moves on whichever side it likes, by a species of jerk, ought to 
be considered as of a higher rank than the muscle, which 
moves slowly in a groove ; but that this latter must also take 
precedence of the S6\en and the cockle,the first of which can 
only move up and down in a hole, and the last of which, hay- 
ing no motion of its own, can only go wheresoever the tide 
may waft it. For the glutton we can boast the whole genus

to heroes of the main ; the former, besides that, should serve 
rpe for another portraiture, virtue nobly struggling with mis-

fortune. The shell of this interesting creature is, as we are in- 
formed, exceedingly thin and fragile, and divided into as many 
as forty chambers or compartments (fg. 7. m), through every 
one of which a portion of its body passes, connected, as it were, 
by a thread. Thus situated, it has many enemies ; and among 
others the Trochus [frochus, a boy's top ; resemblance in some 
of the species) {fg. 8, a) who makes war upon it with un- 
relenting fury. Pursued by this cruel foe, it ascends to 
the top of the water, spreads its little sail to catch the flying 
breeze, and rowing with all its might, scuds along, like a gal- 
ley in miniature, and, by the exertion of its nautical talents, 
endeavours to escape its more cumbrous pursuer. Some- 
times, however, all will not do, the Tiochus nears and nears, 
and escape appears impossible; but then the little animal, 
with inexplicable ingenuity, suddenly and secretly extricates 
itself from its tortuous and fragile dwelling, and whicli, when 
the Zr5chus perceives, he immediately turns to other prey. 
The Nautilus then returns to tenant and repair its little bark; 
but it too often happens that before it can regain it, it is by a 
species of shipwreck dashed to pieces on the shore. Thus 
wretchedly situated, this hero of the testaceous tribe seeks 
some obscure corner " where to die," but which, nevertheless, 
seldom, if ever, happens, until after he has made extraordi- 
nary efforts to establish himself anew. 

Some shells, and among them some of the most beautiful, 
have an outward covering or veil called an epidermis {fg. 
8. abed), and of these would I select largely for the por- 
traiture which I should be inclined to give of female excel- 
lence ; for this puts me in mind of the veil of modesty, through 

which every charm comes doubled to the beholder's eye.

them lovable than wise. I hope I sliall also be forgiven, if 
I mingle with it the Pinna (pinna, a wing or feather ; shape)

understood that the qualities of the heart are the most 
valuable ; and that of these purity and sincerity are among the 
foremost. The head I would adorn with the VenuA* (the 
sea-born goddess) islandica {fig. 8. d\ and Venu5 Chion^ 
{Chione, the daughter of Daedalion, of whom Apollo and 
Mercury became enamoured) {fg. 8. /) which, besides its 
uncommon beauty, contains an animal capable of assuming a 
variety of forms at pleasure : and is not this a good sha- 
dowing of the wisdom of her who can turn her talents to 
whatever fate may have rendered the most necessary and 
pleasing in her? Enchanted with this the last of my crea- 
tions, as a proof of my affection I will add a belt of the 
Merita (neros, hollow ; the superior whorls occupying but a 
small portion of the internal cavity) canrena ( fig. 8. k), and 
take my leave ; not, I fear, before you have in your own mind 
likened this shell of my thoughts to the Lepas {lepas, a rock ; 
adhering to rocks) anatifera {a?ias, a goose, J^o, to bear; 
feather-like tentacula gave rise to the whimsical supposition

Art. VII. A general Introductory View of the Jussieuean or 
Natural Si/stem of Plants. 

The difficulties connected with the adoption of the natural 
system of plants are these, that the characters of many of tlie 
orders are at present imperfectly known, and that they depend 
upon a consideration of many points of structure, which are 
not to be determined without much labour, and a considerable 
degree of practical skill in the use of the microscope and the 
dissecting knife. But the facilities which the habit of viewing 
all natural bodies with reference to the relations they bear to 



Introductory Vim of the Natural System of Plants, 31 

other bodies, and not as insulated individuals merely possess- 
ing certain peculiarities by which they may be referred to 
some station in an artificial system, ultimately gives to the 
investigations of the naturalist, are so great, that difficulties of 
the nature just alluded to ought not to be suffered to influence 
the botanist in determining which line of study he will follow, 
whether that pointed out by Linnaeus, or that traced by the 
hand of nature. By the artificial system of Linnaeus, in- 
deed, no great difficulty exists in determining the number of 
stamens or styles possessed by a given plant, or the nature of 
their combination, and, from the knowledge so obtained, in 
referring them to their class and order in the Linnean system. 
But when this step has been gained, what more has been 
acquired than the bare knowledge that the plant in question 
possesses a certain number of stamens and styles ? No pos- 
sible notion can be formed of the relation it bears to other 
plants of the same nature, of the qualities it probably pos- 
sesses, of the structure of those parts not under examination, — 
the fruit, for example : and, finally, if it were wished to convey 
an idea of the plant to a stranger, no means of doing so 
would be in the possession of the Linnean botanist, except by 
stating that the plant belongs to Pentandria Monogynia, for 
example ; which is stating nothing. But what would be the 
condition of the student of the natural affinities of plants in a 
similar case ? It is true he would be obliged to consult more 
characters than the two uninfluential ones of Linnaeus : it 
would be necessary to ascertain whether his subject is vascular 
or cellular; if vascular, whether it is monocotyledonous or 
dicotyledonous ; if dicotyledonous, whether the leaves are 
opposite or alternate, stipulate or exstipulate, whether the 
flowers are monopetalous, polypetalous, or apetalous, the 
nature and station of the stamens, the condition of the ova- 
rium, and so on. But when he has ascertained thus much, 
only let it be remembered for a moment how much he has 
gained indirectly as well as directly. Perhaps he has dis- 
covered that his plant belongs to i^ubiaceae ; he will then 
have learned that all vegetables with opposite entire stipulate 
leaves, and a monopetalous superior corolla are also rubia- 
ceous ; if a fragment of the leaves and stem only of such a 
plant were afterwards submitted to him for examination, he 
would recognise its affinities, and remember that it was ru- 
biaceous, and, being aware of that fact, he would be able 
safely to infer that its calyx and corolla would be of a pairti- 
cular nature ; that if the roots afforded any colour for dyeing 
it would be red ; that the medicinal properties of the bark, if 
any, would be tonic, astringent and febrifugal ; and that its 



82 Introductory View of the Natural Systefn of Plants, 

seeds would be of the same nature as those of coffee ; and, 
finally, its geographical position would be tolerably certain to 
him. 

The really important obstacle which exists in the way of 
acquiring this kind of knowledge is undoubtedly the want of 
any introduction to the study of it, accompanied by the distri- 
bution and characters of the natural orders into which plants 
are divided. It is to be hoped that English readers at least 
will not long have to regret this deficiency in their elementary 
works. In this place it must suffice to point out the charac- 
ters upon which the great divisions depend, under which the 
orders themselves are arranged ; and it is to be hoped that 
even this small aid will be found to smooth the way, and to 
remove some of the obstacles that at present are supposed to 
exist at the very threshold of the temple. 



Plants, considered with reference to their general structure, 
are separated into two grand divisions, called Cellula^res 
and Vascula^res. 

The Cellulares answer to the Linnean Cryptogamia, and 
are also called Acotyledonous ; the Vascu lares answer to the 
rest of the Linnean system, which is sometimes called Phane- 
rogamia and Cotyledonous. 

Cellula^res, Cryptogamous, or Acotyledonous plants, 
are all, therefore, different terms, denoting the same combina- 
tion of vegetables. The first term is here adopted in prefer- 
ence to the others, as expressing the most obvious character 
upon which the division depends, namely, the cellular, not 
vascular, structure of the plants composing it. Cellular plants

are formed entirely of cellular tissue (Jig, 9.)> without woody 
fibre or spiral vessels ; or, in more familiar terms, by their 
having no veins in their leaves if foliaceous, and not forming 
wood ; they are also destitute of perfect flowers. The lower 
tribes, such as -Fdngi and A']gae, are destitute of leaves, and in 
some points approach the animal kingdom so nearly as to be 
scarcely distinguishable from it. In the highest tribe, i^lices, 
apparent veins are formed in the leaves ; but, as they are imper- 
fectly supplied with spiral vessels, they cannot be considered 
more than analogous to the veins of other plants. Ferns, how- 
ever, hold the intermediate station between Cellulares and 
Vasculares, and are chiefly retained among the former, on 
account of their perfect accordance in other respects. In 
the whole of Acotyledones it is unnecessary to examine the 
seed for the purpose of determining whether it has one co- 
tyledon, several cotyledons, or none, the structure of the 
perfect plant giving the most obvious and satisfactory evi- 
dence. 

Vascula^res, Phanerogamous, or Cotyledonou's plants 
are also separated into two great classes, called Endogenes or 
Monocotyledones, and Exogenes or Dicotyledones, both 
which are distinguished as accurately by their obvious physi- 
cal structure as they are by the minute and obscure peculiari- 
ties of the seed. They are all formed with cellular tissue, 
woody fibre, and spiral vessels (7%-. 10.), and their leaves are 
traversed by veins ; the last character is sufficient for practical 
purposes, if it is remembered that they also bear perfect 
flowers, (that is, flowers furnished either with stamina or pis- 
tilla, or both,) which always prevent their being confounded 
with the highest tribes of Cellulares.

EnddgerieSy or Monocotyledonous plants, are the first remove 
from Cellulares, and hold an intermediate rank between them 
and Exogenes or Dicotyledonous plants, in which vegetation ac- 
quires its highest form of developement. They were formerly 
characterised by having a single cotyledon, but this circum- 
stance is not only not absolute, but difficult of determination, 
except after minute analysis. The real difference between their 
seed and that of Dicotyledones is this, that in Monocotyl^- 
dbnes there is only one cotyledon {fig. 11. 5), or, if two, that 
they are alternate with each other {Jig.l\.t\ while in Dicotyle- 
dones they are always opposite, and more than one, sometimes 
several, as in Pinus. [Jig. 12. y.) The physiological structure 
of the two classes is, however, that by which they are fami- 
liarly distinguished, and exhibits a beautiful proof of the har- 
mony that exists between the great features of vegetation and 
their first principle, the seed from which they originate. In 
Endogenes or Monocotyledones there is no distinction between 
wood and bark (Jig. 11.^); in Exogenes or Dicotyledones, the 
wood and bark are distinctly separated, {^g. 12. v.) In Mo- 
nocotyledones the wood and cellular tissue are mixed together, 
without any distinct annual layers of the former being evident; 
in Dicotyledones the wood and cellular tissue have each their 
particular limits assigned them, a distinct layer of the former 
being annually deposited. In Monocotyledones there are no. 
radiations from the medulla to the bark ; in Dicotyledones 
the radiations are distinctly marked. In Monocotyledones 
there is generally no articulation between the leaves and the 
stem, while in Dicotyledones the leaves are always jointed 
with the stem from which they fall off, leaving a scar behind. 
In Monocotyledones the veins of the leaf pass in parallel lines

from the base to the apex, in Dicotyledones they diverge from 
the midrib towards the margin at various angles ; in the for- 
mer they are branchless, the -principal veins being con- 
nected by nearly simple secondary veins ; in the latter they 
are much branched, ramifying in many directions, and giving 
the surface of the leaf a netted appearance. 

Such are the very obvious distinctions of the two great 
classes of Phanerogamous, or flowering plants; and so far 
is it from there being any necessity for dissecting a seed in 
order to ascertain its structure, that this point is one of the 
most easy determination, and about which there cannot be in 
one case in five hundred the slightest cause of doubt or diffi- 
culty. It is almost impossible to take even a morsel of a 
plant in the hand without instantly being in possession of the 
knowledge of the structure of its seed, with respect to the 
cotyledons. 

Thus far have we advanced without a single oostacle to 
impede us. In all farther investigation no greater degree of 
knowledge or application is requisite, than what ought to be 
possessed by every one who would be able to ascertain the 
genus of a plant. Many of the orders do not depend upon 
the minute characters of the seed so much as is believed ; the 
structure of the ovarium and position of the ovula are aids 
which frequently make amends for the absence of fruit : and 
the nature of the foliage and inflorescence are guides which, 
though sometimes treacherous, are often as faithful as the 
fructification itself. But as it is not intended to give the 
characters of the orders in this place, neither is it necessary 
to advance farther in an explanation of the manner of deter- 
mining them ; upon that point each order would require a 
particular note. It may however be confidently believed that

there are no greater impediments ni the road to an acquaint- 
ance with the natural relations of plants than those which have 
been already removed; and that, although neither the science of 
botany, nor any other science, is to be taken by storm, yet the 
fortress is sure to be reduced by silent and patient approach. 

It only remains to explain briefly the principles upon which 
the names of the orders, sub-orders, &c., are formed. It is 
usual, in the school of Jussieu, to give to a natural order a 
name derived from that of the genus which is understood to be 
the type of the order, — as i^anunculaceae from jRanunculus, 
iiosaceae from i^osa, and so on : but several deviations from 
this principle were admitted by Jussieu, in favour of cer- 
tain groups of plants, long known by other popular names 
derived from certain peculiarities ; such as Labiatae, because 
their corollas are labiate ; Compositae, because their flowers 
are what is commonly called compound ; Guttiferae, on account 
of the resinous juice in which they abound; and some others. 
It would, perhaps, have been better if uniformity in nomen- 
clature had not thus been sacrificed to a dread of innovation ; 
but it is now too late to remedy the evil, if such it is ; nor 
would the advantage of alteration be at this day equivalent to 
the inconvenience. For the purpose of making it at once 
apparent whether, in speaking of a group of plants, reference 
is had to an order or a sub-order, it has of late years been 
thought convenient to terminate the name of the natural order 
in acece, and that of the sub-order in ece : thus, in speaking 
of the whole mass of which jRanunculus is the representa- 
tive, the word RmmncxAdcecB is used; but in speaking of the 
particular division or sub-order of which Ranunculus forms a 
part, the term i^anuncuk^ is employed. This manner of 
speaking is, however, at present very partial in its application ; 
and is of little importance, except in a few cases of which 
J?anunculaceae is one of the most striking examples. In those 
orders, the titles of which, necessarily from their grammatical 
construction, end in ece, as Orchideae, it is obviously inappli- 
cable, without a total change in a great part of the nomencla- 
ture of natural orders, a measure which cannot be too much 
deprecated. 

It may, perhaps, be expected that these remarks should 
conclude with a recommendation of some work, fi'om which 
those who are anxious to become fully acquainted with 
the principles and distinguishing characters of the natural 
system of botany, may derive the necessary information. Un- 
fortunately, however, such a work has at present no existence. 
M. DecandoUe's Th(^orie FfUmentaire de la Botanique explains 
the principles upon which the orders of plants are constituted, 
and M. de Jussieu's Genera Plantamm contains their characters 



Forest Trees of Europe^ as Elements of Landscape. 37 

as determined in 1789: but the latter is now too obsolete to 
be very useful to the tyro. In our own language the only 
work that can be consulted upon the subject with advantage 
is the Flora Scotica of Professor Hooker, in which the charac- 
ters of the natural orders of Scottish plants are concisely 
indicated by Mr. Lindley. 

[The foregoing forms a part of the introduction to our En-

sions and subdivisions of vegetables according to this system, 
in doing which we shall give figures of all the principal genera,

occurrence in Britain, in order to render this superior mode 
of studying botany as easily and universally understood as

Art. VIII. The principal Forest Trees of Europe, considered as 
Elements of Landscape. By J. G. Strutt. 

There is no defect so common in painted or engraved 
landscapes, as the want of distinctive character in the repre- 
sentations of trees. "With the exception of Constable, Nasmyth, 
Robson, Strutt, and a few others, most artists appear to con- 
tent themselves with producing variations of a few general and 
vague forms of masses of foliage, trunks, branches, and spray : 
it seems to be enough for them to produce a tree, without at- 
tempting to represent any particular species ; or considering 
that to give a true idea of nature, the spectator ought to be able 
to distinguish the sort of tree in the picture, with the same 
facility with which he distinguishes it in the reality. Why trees 
should not be represented with the same truth and fidelity as 
animals, buildings, or other objects, there can be no good 
reason assigned ; and the only way of accounting for it is, by 
the general residence of landscape painters in cities, and the 
very little attention paid by most of t'.iem to natural history as 
a science. Were this study to enter into the education of the 
landscape painter, as much as that of general history enters 
into that of the historical painter, we should not so frequently 
have to regret, in the works of our first artists, not only viola- 
tions of truth and nature in the kinds of trees, but in their 
situations in regard to soil, surface, water, and other trees or 
plants. A little knowledge of botany would prevent artists 
from putting spring and autumnal plants in flower or fruit in

the same picture, placing the plants of woods and shady 
places in open sunshine, and committing a number of similar 
violations of nature. The combined knowledge of indigenous 
zoology, geology, and botany, ought to be considered as es- 
sential to the landscape painter as it is to the cultivator. It 
is one object of our Magazine to direct public attention to this 
subject ; and we are happy in having procured the assistance 
of Mr. Strutt for the tree department. • Every reader, who is 
acquainted with the admirable engravings in this gentleman's 
Sylva Britdnnica and DeUcicE Sylvdrwn, will know what to 
expect from so eminent an artist. 

The botanical characters of the trees, which will follow Mr. 
Strutt's pictorial descriptions, will be given chiefly for the 
sake of beginners in botany ; and to show to artists, self- 
practising amateurs, as well as professional men, the detailed 
forms of the leaves, flowers, and smaller parts. To insure the 
accuracy of these botanical details, they will be looked over by 
Mr. George Don, too well known as a scientific botanist to 
require any eulogium here. — Cond.

It is a beautiful notion of St. Pierre's, and one which has 
the advantage of being safe from any positive contradiction, 
that the earth, on its first assumption of form and laws, ap- 
peared clothed, with respect to the vegetable creation, not only 



as Elements of Landscape, 39 

in the verdure which has been well styled " her universal 
robe," but also with trees in every stage of their existence ; an 
idea which Milton has also given us in his exquisite descrip- 
tion of the creation : — 

« Last 

Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread 
Their branches, hung with copious fruit, or gemm'd 
With blossoms; with high woods the hills were crown'd. 
With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side; 
With borders long the rivers : that earth now 
Seem'd like to Heav'n, a seat where gods might dwell. 
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt 
Her sacred shades.'* 

Leaving, however, for the present, the dryads and hama- 
dryads of such enchanting precincts to the poets who have so 
well embodied their existence, we shall turn our attention to 
" the stately trees," and endeavour to ascertain, and to point 
out, to such of our readers as may be desirous to acquire some 
knowledge of their varieties and character, with reference to 
their appearance and effect in landscape, the most striking 
peculiarities in each species, and the mode best adapted for 
their delineation. In the course of this disquisition, \ffe shall 
have occasion to present to the young student in. painting, a 
variety of sketches illustrative of our propositions, given, not 
from the recorded treasures of the brain, but from a more 
inexhaustible storehouse ; being acquired by diligent study in 
the living academies of nature, — the groves and the forests of 
our native country. And here it may be well observed, that no 
set of rules or examples, drawn from other men's labours, will 
be sufficient to form an original landscape painter : we can 
only put the proper implements into the hands of the student, 
form in him a habit of accurate perception, and introduce 
him to the objects best adapted for his pencil : it is for him to 
find his own path for the future, and penetrate into the soli- 
tudes and the recesses of the forest, where every thing will be 
congenial to his pursuit, and where he will not have to com- 
plain in the elegant language of Quintilian, — " Quare sil- 
varum amoenitas, et praeterlabentia flumina, et inspirantes 
ramis arborum aurae, volucrumque cantus et ipsa late circum- 
spiciendi libertas, ad se trahunt; ut mihi remittere potius 
voluptas ista videatur cogitationem, quam intendere." " Where- 
fore the sweet tranquillity of the woods, ' the liquid lapse of 
murmuring streams,' the soft whisperings of the summer air 
amid the boughs, the melodies of birds, and the unrestrained 
freedom that the eye enjoys, all attract the mind to them- 
selves, so that these delights appear to me rather to interrupt 
than to promote our meditations."

The Oak Tree, considered 



European trees may, by the painter, be divided into four 
classes : the round-topped, as the oak, chestnut, elm, willow, 
ash, beech, &c. ; the spiry- topped, as the different species of 
the fir tribe ; the shaggy-topped, comprehending those of the 
pine ; and the slender-formed, as the Lombardy poplar and 
the cypress. In the first of these classes, foremost in dignity 
and grandeur, the oak stands pre-eminent, and like the lion 
among beasts, is the undoubted lord of the forest. Beauty, 
united with strength, characterises all its parts. The leaves, 
elegant in their outline, are strongly ribbed, and firmly at- 
tached to the spray, which, although slim and excursive, is 
yet bold and determined in its angles, whilst the abrupt and 
tortuous irregularity of its massive branches, admirably con- 
trasts with the general richness and density of its clustered 
foliage. Even as a sapling, in its slender gracefulness, it ex- 
hibits sufficient firmness and indications of vigour, to predi- 
cate the future monarch of the wood ; a state, indeed, which 
it is slow to assume, but 
which lix&idXnspersceculu 
longa ; and when, at 
length, it is brought to 
acknowledge the influ- 
ence of time, and becomes 
" bald with dry anti- 
quity," no other produc- 
tion of the forest can be 
admitted as its rival in 
majestic and venerable decay. The general form of the oak 
is expansive, luxuriant, and spreading. Its character, both 
with respect to its whole, and to its larger masses of 
foliage, is best expressed by the pencil in bold and roundish 
lines, whether as single trees {fig. 13.)> as groups {Jig, 14.), or 
as forming the line of a distant forest {f^s. 15, 16.) : although 





when growing more closely together, they assume a loftier 
and less spreading appearance than the more solitary trea, 
such as Mason has so beautifully described in his Caractacus, — 
" Behold yon oak, 

How stern he frowns, and, with his broad brown arms, 

Chills the pale plain beneath him." 



as an Element of Landscape . 



41 



The sketches (Jigs. 14, 15, 16.)> to which we have just 
alluded, will more distinctly exemplify our position, exhi- 
biting, in the distinct distances, the same general appearance 
in the contour of the trees. 




But whilst, as an entire object, these curved lines are suffi- 
cient to express the general peculiarity of its outline, as well 
as the larger masses of its foliage, when we come to examine 
the oak more closely, and in detail, we find that a greater 
variety of line must be adopted to display its singular propor- 
tions, so indicative of energy and boldness. The trunk and 
limbs (Jig, 17.) are characterised by their amazing strength, 




and by their comparative shortness and crookedness; and 
the branches by their numerous contortions and abrupt angles, 
and by the great variety which they exhibit of straight and of 



42 The Oak, as an Element of Landscape* 

crooked lines, and by their frequent tendency to a horizontal 
direction : these striking peculiarities are exemplified in the 
accompanying sketch. (Jig, 17.) 

Not unfrequently, however, the forms of the limbs and 
branches are entirely concealed by the exuberancy of foliage, 
as is the case in the Bounds- Park oak, and more particularly 
in that magnificent living canopy, — nidli penetrabilis astro, im- 
pervious to the day, — (fully described in the S^va Britannica), 
the Chandos oak at Southgate, which, although not exactly a 
painter's tree, is unquestionably unrivalled for regular beauty 
and plenitude of shade. The oak, also, is occasionally found 
to present an extremely graceful and pleasing figure, as is re- 
markably the case widi the celebrated oak at Lord Cowper's, 
of which we have given a drawing. [Jig. 13.) This tree, .above 
a century ago, was well known as the great oak at Panshanger. 




There is also a beautiful tree, represented in the last of 
these sketches (fg. 18.), of the same description, at Lord 
Darnley's seat at Cobham, which, being protected from the 
depredations of cattle, enjoys the most perfect freedom of 
growth, extending " its latitude of boughs" in every direction, 
and drooping its clustered foliage to the very ground.

I DREW up the enclosed notice of M. Audubon's publication, 
with the intention of sending it to you anonymously ; but 
justice to its author, and a wish of assisting your infant Maga-

This avowal may possibly have some weight with those, who 
may be tempted to think that praise has descended into flat-

In nothing is the inconsistency of mankind more strik- 
ing than in their treatment of genius. In every generation 
arises one or two spirits, who seem destined to attain a 
marked preeminence in what they undertake ; and to contra- 
dict the axiom, that knowledge advances by slow and imper- 
ceptible steps. Absorbed in the accomplishment of their ob- 
ject, or devoted to their particular study, they become blind to 
all considerations of a mere worldly nature. The advantages of 
interest, the acquirement of wealth, even the comforts of social 
life, are by such men despised or set at nought, if opposed 
to the ruling passion of their minds. To attain this, they 
will struggle against difficulties, apparently insurmountable, 
against discouragements innumerable, and against poverty 
itself. Yet how do the world receive such spirits ? Let the 
page of history answer. In every age, however enlightened, 
and in every kingdom, however great, innumerable are the 
melancholy examples of its coldness, ingratitude, or apathy. 
Historians, philosophers, poets, painters, naturalists — have 



44 Audubo7i's Birds of Amaica. 

shared the same fate ; have been neglected wliile living, and 
have sunk to the grave in obscurity or want. Yet no sooner 
are they placed beyond the joys or the sorrows of this world, 
than men's minds undergo a sudden change; they discover 
exalted merit in what was before ordinary talent ; they lament 
over " departed genius," follow its poor remains, perhaps 
ostentatiously, to the grave, recite eulogiums on the departed, 
and finally erect a splendid monument over his ashes — a me- 
morial of unavailing honours to the dead, and of silent re- 
proach to the living. 

Such has been the usual fate of genius, in every age and 
in every country. The observation may be trite ; but, like 
many other things, we require to have it forced on our recol- 
lections. That there are great and striking exceptions, where 
genius, during life, has been appreciated and rewarded, 
is a gratifying fact. The more so, as it goes far to account 
for its frequent neglect, when living. Mankind, in general, 
are prone to acknowledge merit when it becomes strikingly 
conspicuous : more particularly in matters that are within 
the comprehension of the many ; or where it concerns the 
comforts, amusements, or interests of the whole commu- 
nity. The safety-lamp immediately raised its discoverer to 
eminence : and the perfecting of the steam-engine secured 
wealth and honour to him who achieved it. But where genius 
is employed on pursuits of a less popular nature, pursuits 
which belong solely to our intellectual gratification, it is less 
perceived, for its merits can be known to few. Even among 
these, it has not unfrequently to contend against party feeling, 
personal envy, or secret jealousy. In matters of taste, the 
great bulk of mankind, not having the power to judge for 
themselves, rely on the opinion of those few who can point out 
what is excellent. They may be often, indeed, misled by such 
guides; but the public, in the end, generally arrive at a just 
conclusion. If once their attention is awakened to unques- 
tionable merit, they are seldom backward in acknowledging 
and rewarding it. To awaken this attention, however, is the 
great difficulty. So many are the candidates, and so numerous 
are their claims, that, unless a writer has the influence of the 
press, or the patronage of the booksellers, he has but little 
chance of success. Besides, people in general are so taken up 
with their own immediate pursuits, that they can seldom afford 
attention to other matters, unless they are actually brought 
before them. 

I must confess that such has been my case with the work 
I am to notice. I never saw it announced in the booksellers* 
lists, exhibited in the London print-shops, or lauded in the 



Auduhoji^s Birds of Ameika, '45 

Literary Gazette; neither did its prospectus swell the bulk 
of the Quarterly. A short notice of the first number in 
a scientific journal * excited no particular interest in my 
mind; and, but for other circumstances, it is probable I 
should have known as little about it, as the public seem to 
do at this moment. 

Nevertheless, I had heard enough of the author, to excite 
the greatest interest in his history. M. Audubon, if I have 
been rightly informed, is a citizen of America, descended from 
French parents. Devotedly attached to the study of nature, 
no less than to painting, he seems to have pursued both with 
a genius and an ardour, of which, in their united effects, there is 
no parallel. His two ornithological narratives, printed in one 
of the Scotch journals, are as valuable to the scientific world as 
they are delightful to the general reader ; they give us a rich 
foretaste of what we may hope and expect from such a man. 
There is a freshness and an originality about these essays, which 
can only be compared to the animated biographies of Wilson. 
Both these men contemplated Nature as she really is, not as 
she is represented in books : they sought her in her sanctua- 
ries. The shore, the mountain, and the forest were alternately 
their study, and there they drank the pure stream of know-* 
ledge at its fountain-head. The observations of such men are 
the corner stones of every attempt to discover the natural 
system. Their writings will be consulted when our favourite 
theories shall have passed into oblivion. Ardently, therefore, 
do I hope, that M. Audubon will alternately become the 
historian and the painter of his favourite objects ; that he will 
never be made a convert to any system, but instruct and delight 
us as a true and unprejudiced biographer of Nature. 

I am now to speak of M. Audubon more particularly as a 
painter. I shall, therefore, view the work before me as a 
specimen of the fine arts, and judge it by those rules which 
constitute pictorial criticism. The size of the plates, exceeds 
any thing of the kind I have either seen or heard of; they 
are no less than 3 ft. 3 in. long, by 2 ft. 2 in. broad ! On this 
vast surface every bird is represented in its full dimensions. 
Large as is the paper, it is sometimes (as in the male wild

it enables the painter to group his figures, in the most beauti- 
ful and varied attitudes, on the trees or plants they frequent. 
Some are feeding, others darting, pursuing, or capturing their 
prey; all have life and animation. The plants, fruit, and 
flowers which enrich the scene, are alone still. These latter,

Audubon^ s Birds of America, 



from their critical accuracy, are as valuable to the botanist as 
the birds are to the ornithologist. The early plates are exe- 
cuted by Lizars, the latter ones by the Havells, in an open, 
free style, well adapted for colouring. This latter process is, 
in most instances, performed faithfully ; but a little more 
attention on the part of the colourer, in copying the exact tint, 
would be desirable. i^-r 

Such is the general character of the work, but it is of a 
nature to demand a more particular notice. What I have 
said might, in a general way, be repeated of others. This, 
as I shall presently show, is perfectly unique, both in its 
conception and execution. To explain this, I call the reader's 
attention to the following plates, or rather pictures : — 

The female Wild Turkey ajid hei' Young. (PI. 6.) — The 
immense size of the principal figure (which will barely come 
within the paper) has obviously fettered the artist in his choice 
of attitude. If not graceful, it is nevertheless easy and natural, 
while the details are perfectly accurate. But the great merit 
of the picture lies in the brood of young ones, collected round 
the mother, and variously employed. Some are picking the 







leaves of plants, others looking about for insects {Jig. 19.), 
one is trimming its tail, and all are busy. The grouping of 



Audtiboii's Birds of America. 47 

these little creatures cannot be surpassed ; it would do honour 
to the pencil of Rubens. The pencilling is such a perfect copy 
of nature, that, although the attitudes are difficult, and per- 
haps uncommon, we fancy we have seen them over and"^ over 
again. A little one in the fore-ground, immediately under its 
mother, is particularly fine : it has laid itself on its side, and 
raised one of its wings to catch a small A'carus or harvest bug 
not yet lodged within the feathers ; the head of this, and of 
another pecking at a lady-bird, are admirable specimens of 
foreshortening. I wish the plants had been engraved in a 
different style from the other subjects, — they are too coarse; 
but the etching of the infant progeny does great credit to Mr. 
Lizars's talents. 

Purple Grakles. (PL 7. upright.) — As a composition this 
is my chief favourite. The size of the birds and of the plant 
has enabled the painter to group both in large and imposing 
masses. The grakles are called, in America, maize-thieves, from 
their destroying the Indian corn. Two of these birds are 
here represented " in the fact : " one is clinging to an ear of 
maize, from which it has extracted its seeds ; the other is 
clearing away the outer husk of a fresh ear, having stripped 
that on the left of all the best grains. The story is clearly 
told ; and the grouping of the parts so judicious, as to pro- 
duce a fine effect. 

The Bird of Washington^ or Great America7i Sea Eagle. 
(PI. 11.) — This noble figure is an upright, and occupies the 
full size of the paper. It is standing in repose on a rock, 
and nothing is introduced to take off from the simplicity of 
the design, or the grandeur of the bird. If the passions 
of the brute creation can be traced in their physiology, (and no 
doubt they can,) we can discern as much of the mild dignity 
of the great American patriot, in this his emblem, as can 
well be expressed in the head of a bird. 

Baltimore Orioles, (PI. 12.) — This is a sweet and har- 
monious group. These gaily coloured birds, of a black and 
orange-coloured plumage, have suspended their pensile nest 
among the foliage of a tulip tree, whose broad leaves and 
delicate flowers form an excellent contrast to the other colours. 
The clinging of the female to the side of the nest, is most 
happily expressed : it must have been a study from nature. 
The upper figure of the male, just putting out his feet to alight, 
shows a master's hand. This figure I look upon as the 
"rightful lord" just returned from an absence, during which 
his mate has been insulted or persecuted by an intruder: 
against him, but still clinging to her nest, is she defending 
herself, when her partner comes to the rescue. The figure of 



48 



Audubon^ s Bitds of America, 



this intruder (perhaps designedly) is much inferior to the 
others. 

Great-Footed Falcons in the act of devouring Canadian Teal, 
(PI. 16.) — A masterly, but by no means a pleasing picture. 
It is a scene of slaughter and of butchery. I cannot, however, 
pass over the 
drawing of 
the left hand 
figure, and 
the inimita- 
ble foieshort- 
ening of the 
head {fig. 
20.) without 
praise. The 
leg of the 
right hand 
bird seems to 
me faulty, but 
1 write un- 
der correc- 
tion, never ^^ 
having seen a 
falcon in this 
particular at- 
titude. From 
this I turn 
with pleasure to 

Turtle-doves of Carolina, (PL 17.) — It is quite impossible to 
treat this subject with greater truth, or delicacy of conception, 
than it has here received. In a thicket of the beautiful Stu- 
krxia Malacodendron, (whose white blossoms are emblematic, 
like the dove, of chasteness and purity,) a pair of turtles have 
built their nests. The female is sitting, and — their union 
being consummated — she is receiving the caresses of the male. 
Above is another pair ; their love is in its infancy. The male, 
seated on the same branch with his intended partner, is 
eagerly pressing forwards to reach a " stolen kiss," but the 
head of the female is coyly turned. Her secret satisfaction 
is, however, expressed by the agitation of her wings and tail. 
If the artist had never painted any picture but this, it would 
secure him the highest meed of praise, so long as truth and 
nature continued the same. 

Mocking Birds defending their Nest from a Rattlesnake. 
(PL 21.) — The same poetic sentiment and masterly execution 
characterises this picture. The formidable reptile has driven 




Audubon's Birds of America, 49 

the female bird from her eggs, which he intends to suck. 
Unable to defend them while sitting, she clings to the side ; 
and, " with outstretched wings and forward breast," seems 
prepared to strike her bill into the very jaws of her enemy. 
Her cries have brought two others of her race to the spot : 
but these, not feeling a parent's solicitude, " come not boldly " 
to the attack. On the courage of the male bird the fate of 
the conflict seems to depend. He Ls close to the serpent, 
aiming a deadly stroke at its eye, while his own is lighted up 
with a determination and courage, which seem to bespeak 
anticipated victory. Every part of the story is told with 
exquisite feeling. The artist has thrown his greatest skill in 
the figure of the female bird, and it is uncommonly fine. 

Purple Martins building their Nest in a Gourd, (PI. 22.) — 
M. Audubon seems to delight in attitudes which would set 
every other ornithological painter at defiance. How inimit- 
able is the foreshortening of the upper left hand figure ! the 
mouth appears actually open. The female bird, pluming her 
wing, shows the ease with which his pencil can master the 
greatest difficulties. 

Song Sparr&ws, (PI. 25.) — I look on the attitude of the 
male, as one of the most difficult that can well be imagined. 
It is a complete front view of a bird, with half-expanded 
wings, in the act of seizing a spider immediately above its 
head. The ease and gracefiilness of the pencilling are very 
striking. 

Carolina Parrots. (PL 26.) — This is a most extraordinary 
picture. It represents a flock of these birds, busily engaged 
in devouring the seeds of the cuckle-bur. These parrots 
must be great favourites with the painter, or he would not 
have introduced them so profusely; there are no less than 
seven figures placed in the most varied attitudes, and all the 
size of life. Although not charged as such, the colouring of 
this plate must have cost three times the price of the others. 
Yet a painter would not be wholly pleased with it. Not, 
indeed, from any defect in the artist, but firom the im- 
possibility of keeping down the superabundant vividness of 
the golden and red heads of these birds. The colours in 
nature are so brilliant, that they defy all attempts at harmo- 
nising. 

The last plate I shall dwell upon is, A Family of Red- 
headed Woodpeckers. (PI. 27.) This is a peculiarly picturesque 
composition. The ground-work is the decayed trunk of a 
tree, perforated by insects, in the hollow of which the old 
birds have reared their young; one of the latter, hearing 
the arrival of the parents fi'om a foraging party, has emerged 

Vol. I. — No. 1. e 



50 Audubon^ s Birds of America, 

half way in the entrance ; two others, who seem to have 
been on the look-out, are eagerly receiving the produce of 
the chase. The female bird has just returned from a dis- 
tance with a ripe berry ; the male is on the trunk of the 
tree, holding forward, in his bill, a caterjsillar, which one of 
the young birds is impatient to seize. This happily illus- 
trates the frugivorous and insectivorous food of this species, so 
different from those of the typical woodpeckers. The figure of 
the male bird will remind the painter of that sideshortening 
(to coin a new phrase), so common in the pictures of Paul 
Veronese, and which gives such a graceful turn to many of 
his best figures. 

Many of the excellencies which I have already dwelt 
upon, will be found in the less imposing subjects ; but 
these need not be enumerated. Nothing in this world can 
be perfect ; and, that my judgment may not be deemed par 
tial, I shall touch on two or three, in which I think the 
painter has not been equally happy. The lower figure of 
PI. 23. has the bill too much inclined upwards for the di 
rection of the head. The form of the bird in PI. 30. may 
be natural, but is, to me, thick and displeasing. The colour- 
ing of PL 1 5. is harsh and much too vivid ; and there is a hea- 
viness in the figure of PI. 24. which is a solitary exception 
to my preceding remarks. Were I, however, taxed for 
further criticisms, I could not increase the list, while they 
are so insignificant in themselves, as scarcely to deserve 
notice. 

I have heard that M. Audubon resided twenty-five 
years in the woods of America, devoted to this one pursuit. 
Without any other testimony than the plates before me, I 
can well believe the fact. He must have lived with a note- 
book in his pocket, and a pencil in his hand. Nothing short 
of such a period, and of such enthusiasm, could have 
achieved what he has done. The same devotedness to his 
darling object seems to have brought him to Europe, 
under the hope of accomplishing what no individual fortune 
could do, without the support of liberality and wealth ; 
namely, the publication of his works. As yet I feel per- 
fectly convinced that this is done with a heavy and a serious 
loss to himself. Each of the numbers, of which six have 
appeared, contain no less than five plates, and are sold at 
two guineas, being an average of little more than eight shil- 
lings each ! Let this price be compared with the usual 
charge for either publications or prints, and it becomes com- 
paratively nothing. I can only wonder at the disregard 
of the author, for a remuneration even of his own expenses. 



Audubo?i's Birds of America, SI 

So far, therefore, I consider his work as comparatively, one 
of the cheapest that can be purchased. 

I have heard it mentioned, as an objection to the size of 
the work, that the same object could have been accomplished 
by bringing the subjects within the usual dimensions of illus- 
trative publications ; or what the French happily call ouvrages 
de luxe. This I deny. These plates do not exhibit a uni- 
form " rivulet of margin," with a single bird perched upon 
the tall leafless trunk of a tree, " signifying nothing," and 
merely put in to fill the paper. Here every object speaks, 
either to the senses or to the imagination. The examples 
I have quoted, show that histories are to be narrated, and 
peculiarities are to be explained. To trace such things, the 
painter must have " ample room and verge enough." It is 
this which elevates the character of his paintings, from mere 
matter of fact portraits, to historical representations. We feel, 
in short, that it is M. Audubon alone who can produce 
a work, which, without such advantages as he possesses, not 
all the united talents now in existence could supply. 

It will depend on the powerful and the wealthy, whether 
Britain shall have the honour of fostering such a magnificent 
undertaking. It will be a lasting monument, not only to 
the memory of its author, but to those who employ their 
wealth in patronising genius, and in supporting the national 
credit. If any publication deserves such a distinction, it 
is surely this; in as much as it exhibits a perfection in 
the higher attributes of zoological painting, never before 
attempted. To represent the passions and the feelings of 
birds, might, until now, have been well deemed chimerical. 
Rarely, indeed, do we see their outward forms represented 
with any thing like nature. In my estimation, not more 
than three painters ever lived who could draw a bird. Of 
these the lamented Barrabaud, of whom France may be 
justly proud, was the chief. He has long passed away ; but 
his mantle has, at length, been recovered in the forests of 
America. 

On casting my eyes over the list of subscribers, it is 
with gratified feelings that I see His Most Gracious Ma- 
jesty at the head. From the fine and original taste which 
our king seems intuitively to possess, I question whether 
any of his subjects are better qualified to appreciate the 
merits of M. Audubon. The number of nobility who have 
followed the example of their sovereign, as yet, are few. 
To the honour of the public bodies and libraries of Edin- 
burgh, and of our own Universities, they all appear to have 
stepped forward as subscribers ; waving their undoubted

right (hard as that right is,) to the possession of free copies. 
It is singular that nearly the whole of the remaining sub- 
scribers are provincial, principally from Yorkshire, Liverpool, 
and Manchester. This, however, may be accounted for, by 
M. Audubon having visited these parts of England. I 
conclude that in London his name and his works have not 
yet come into notice ; that they assuredly will, ere long, I 
have no doubt. There is superabundant wealth, (and the 
liberality to use it too,) in the metropolis alone, sufficient 
to insure the continuation of ten such works, could they be 
found. 

I have no personal acquaintance with M. Audubon. I 
never even saw him. The copy of his work, which furnished 
these remarks, has been lent to me. These are vouchers 
for my sincerity and disinterestedness. But I can appre- 
ciate genius ; and I shall ever employ my poor abilities to 
make it known. My praise shall be well directed, and I 
shall then feel assured it will ultimately have weight.

Wilson^ William, Esq. F.R.S.E., Member of the Wernerian Natural History 
Society : Illustrations of Zoology ; being Representations of new, rare, 
or otherwise remarkable subjects of the Animal Kingdom, drawn and 
coloured after Nature : with descriptive Letter-press. Blackwood, Edin- 
burgh. Cadell, London. Atlas 4to. Nos. I. II. III. and IV. 16s. each. 
The object of this magnificent work is to convey coloured represent- 
ations (whenever possible, of the size of life,) of whatever animals are the 
most signalised by nature for their scarcity or beauty, or for any extra- 
ordinary peculiarities in their form, structure, instinctive habits, particular 
dispositions, or general econom)^ of life. The plates are accompanied by 
detailed statements of the generic and specific characters of the animals 
delineated j and the representation of every separate order, or extensive 
natural group of the animal kingdom, is preceded by a short introductory 
essay, in which the general characters of that division are very delightfully 
explained. This we conceive to be a principal, and very important 
feature in Mr. Wilson's work, that every species is made to represent and 
illustrate the history of many others ; and thus, in a condensed space, a 
student, while following out the history of a single species, may acquire an 
accurate knowledge of the essential relations of an extensive generic group. 
Most of our author's materials appear to be drawn from the Edinburgh 
Museum, a most richly stored zoological collection, of the origin, pro- 
gress, and present condition of which, we hope, ere long, to provide our 
readers with a compendious history. The work now under review is in- 
tended mainly to illustrate the novelties of that museum ; but, at the same 
time, the author's pages are open to efl&cient communications from all 
other quarters. Indeed his principal object seems to be to relieve the 



Fresh'Watet' Fishes of Great Britain, 53 

science of natural history from the extreme aridity of its accustomed 
details ; and, by combining the precision of a scientific treatise with the 
more excursive and agreeable character of a popular miscellany, to entice 
towards the study those who, not being especially called to it by an in- 
stinctive and irresistible tendency, are apt to be dismayed by the barren 
technicalities of science, falsely so called. 

Mr. Wilson's work, though expensive, is not high-priced : by which we 
mean to say, that although the costly nature of the materials employed, 
renders the publisher's remunerating price considerable, we yet think the 
charge (16^. per number) very moderate. The form is that of atlaf 
quarto j and every number contains four plates, each representing one oi 
more subjects, according to their size ; and is accompanied, as we havi 
said, by corresponding letter-press, splendidly printed by Neill, m which 
the natural history of the animals delineated is amply detailed. The num- 
bers appear at indefinite periods of three or four months, and well merit 
the patronage of those to whom splendid, and at the same time instructive 
books, form the finishing furniture of the drawing-room. In subsequent 
notices we shall present our readers with some characteristic examples of 
the author's style, and mode of treating his subjects. In the meantime, as 
the author of these Illustrations of Zoology is warmly impressed with a 
desire to extend the province of the science, and as we ourselves are now 
venturing to follow in a similar course, with the same object in view, we 
most heartily wish him success. 

Bowdich, Mrs. T. Edward, widow of the late celebrated African traveller ; 
a lady of the most amiable disposition and elegant manners, and of 
great and various acquirements : The Fresh-water Fishes of Great Bri- 
tain. In imperial 4to Numbers. No. I. Ackermann. 
This is a production of no common merit ; and we are the more 
anxious so to announce it, because, from its nature, it can fall into compa- 
ratively few hands, and will be seen much less than it deserves. Mrs. 
Bowdich, the widow of a gentleman whose narrative of the mission to 
Ashantee has obtained considerable celebrity, has here exhibited remark- 
able talent in pourtraying the fishes of our rivers and lakes. When it is 
mentioned that every illustration contained in each copy is separately 
drawn and painted by this lady, without the aid of the engraver, it will be 
perceived that she has undertaken a task of no slight magnitude. As 
the supply of a work, conducted upon such a plan, must necessarily be 
limited, we understand it is not contemplated to extend it beyond fifty 
copies, and even to proceed to that extent will call into exercise an 
unusual degree of perseverance. 

In the classification Mrs. Bowdich has been assisted by Baron Cuvier, 
whose system she has adopted, and who has furnished her with the 
nomenclature he intends to employ in his forthcoming great work on 
Ichthyology. 

The first and only number yet published, contains drawings of the trout, 
carp, roach, and bleak. The regular series of the families has been inten- 
tionally interrupted in the illustrations, for the sake of variety in each 
number; those least interesting to the eye being mingled with their more 
beautiful companions. As specimens of art we can only speak of these 
drawings, in common, we believe, with all who have viewed them, in terms 
of admiration. Each painting has been made from the living fish, imme- 
diately after it came from the water it inhabited, so that no tint has been 
lost or deadened, either by changing the quality of that element, or by ex- 
posure to the atmosphere. The artist has judiciously selected her subjects 
not from extraordinary or large specimens, but from those of a common 
magnitude, and has chiefly (Greeted her attention to convey the correct 
shapes of the fishes, and to exhibit the brilliancy of their colours with

fidelity. They are, therefore, what they profess to be, strictly portraits ; 
and, as such, are most acceptable to the naturalist. 

CurHs, John, Esq. F.L.S. : British Entomology ; being Illustrations and

land; containing coloured Figures from Nature of the most rare and 
beautiful Species, and in many instances of the Plants upon which they 
are found. London. 8vo. Monthly Numbers, 4s. 6d. ; vols. 1/. 1 7s. 6d. each. 

This work was commenced in 1824, and the numbers already published 
exceed four volumes. Though the author limits himself to the illustration 
of genera, yet, by giving a synoptic view of the species of each genus, his 
work is rendered exceedingly complete, and highly instructive to begin- 
ners. The figures, both of the insects and plants, are beautifully executed, 
and in each plate are dissections of the smaller parts, more or less mag- 
nified, as the case may require. The natural order of each genus is given, 
with various synonyms, and references both to published works and exist- 
ing cabinets ; the descriptions are in English. The scientific and English 
names of the plants are also given, and, as the same plant is never re- 
peated, the student may gain from this work a knowledge at once of 
insects and plants. As we shall very frequently have recourse to the past 
volumes in the course of our labours, we shall only stop at present to notice 
the number which has just appeared. 

No. LII. for Aprily contains

most abundantly from the end of April to 

July. There are thirty-three British species. 

The plant on which this figure is shown is the

Species. London. In 8vo Numbers, monthly. 3s. 6d. Nos. I. to XIL 
This work was commenced in 1827, and twelve numbers are pu-blished, 
The object of the author is " concisely to describe, in systematic order, and 
with reference to their natural affinities, such species of insects as have 
hitherto been discovered to inhabit the United Islands of Great Britain and 
Ireland. To these descriptions — which I trust will be sufficiently explicit 
to enable the entomologist clearly and satisfactorily to identify any of the 
insects he possesses, or may hereafter obtain — will be appended such facts, 
relative to the economy or locality of the respective species, as have either 
been communicated by others or observed by myself, accompanied with 
occasional entomological remarks. The average lengths, or the usual ex- 
pansions, of the several species, are also introduced at the end of the specific 
characters; and for the purpose of enabling the student readily to obtain, 
at one view, a knowledge of the contents of any order or inferior section, 
their more obvious characters are laid down, in a tabular form, at the head 
of each superior group. Their peculiar distinctions are afterwards detailed 
in English, drawn out, as far as possible, from external differences ; and, 
unless mentioned to the contrary, the descriptions, &c., are made from, and 
collated with, specimens in my own collection." 

The author seems to have fulfilled his intentions, and we only regret 
that he and Mr. Curtis have not accented the systematic names, given their 
derivations, and also the literal English of the spe- 
cific names, as we have elsewhere recommended. 
We have only room at present to state, that 

JVb. XII. for April contains, of Coleoptera, Platyderus 
{platys broad dere, a neck) ruficollis; Coleoptera 
Harpalidae. Not uncommon in the neighbourhood of 
London. — Argutor {argutor, to make a shrill noise). 
Eleven species, of which the most uncommon is the A. 
vernalis, very abundant near London, inhabiting every 
gravel-pit and stony lane. — Pog6mus(jpogow, a beard). 
Thirty species, all of which inhabit the sea-side. P. 
chalceus {fg. 23.) is found both on the eastern coasts, 
and also on the shores of the Thames and Medway. 
— Pae'cilus {poikilos, spotted). Five species. Of P. vir- 
gaureae (^g. 24.), the male (ab) has the wings above 
of a beautifully resplendent fiery copper colour, the anterior immaculate 
with a black border ; the wings of the female (c) are beautifully spotted.

are very common.

original Plates, drawn and engraved by J. D. C. Sowerby, F. L. S. Lon- 
don. In 8vo Numbers, monthly. 4s. plain ; 6s. highly finished in colours. 
Of this very beautiful work thirty numbers have appeared. The nomen- 
clature followed is generally that of Lamarck ; but »ome alterations have 
been made in the species, and some new genera formed by the author. 
The species are not arranged according to any system ; but, each plate 
having a distinct page of letter-press, the whole may be methodised, when 
completed, at the pleasure of the purchaser, or according to the system 
which may be thought best at the time. In short, by this plan of pub- 
lishing, which is also that of the botanical periodicals, the plates may 
undergo, in the course of their duration, as many modifications of arrange- 
ment, as the shells themselves in a cabinet. One great advantage of it is, 
that it never compels the author to figure from a bad specimen, in ordw 
to go on regularly with his system ; neither is he likely to be so hurried as 
he otherwise would be, in order to prodiice the work regularly ; and the 
consequence is, that the execution of the plates in this work, is of the very 
first order of merit.

Six species from the West Indies and islands of the South Seas. JIfurex

M. haust^llum, so named on account of its remarkably elongated canal ; 
M. cervic6mu, alluding to the stag*s-horn-like protuberances with which 
it is covered; M. phyll6pteris, from its leaf-like appendages; M. tenui- 
spinosus (fig.2S.\ from its slender spines; M. sc6rpio (Jig. 26.) from the 
scorpion-like apices of its fronds ; and M. melanamathos, from its black 
fronds. " The species of the ^enus Murex are numerous, and many of 
them are very beautiful and singular. The long-pointed and regularly 




British Warblers. 57 

arranged spines on Murex tenuispindsus Sam, (commonly called Venus** 
comb) render it an extremely 
interesting and delicate object. 
M. sc6rpio is remarkable for the 
dilated apices of its fronds ; Af. 
radix, for .its fine black short 
spines ; M. regius, for its bril- 
liant crimson-coloured aperture; 
M. cervic6rnu, for the forked 
points of its larger fronds ; M. 
palma-rosa, for the delicately 
tinted tips of its finely toothed 
fronds ; and M. haust^Uum, for 
its uncommonly lengthened ca- 
nal. These are mostly tropical 
species j but the genus is found in all countries : it is marine, and is na- 
turally furnished with an epidermis, though this is commonly cleaned off 
before these shells come into the market. 

" Of fossil species of ilfurex there are also many, generally belonging 
to the tertiary beds. 

" There b a circumstance of unusual interest to be observed in the 
manner in which the animal increases the size of its shell, and which shows 
most admirably the regularity and beauty of the laws of nature, and directs 
the mind to the contemplation of the wisdom and power of the Creator, 
who alone could teach these little animals how to construct a habitation 
so perfectly adapted to their circumstances and situation. It will be ob- 
served, that each periodical increase of these shells, consists of a piece 
which surrounds about a third part, or less, of the lower portion or the 
last volution already formed, which portion is always terminated by a varix, 
which is more or less muricated and even spinose ; it is obvious that these 
murications or spines must be in the way of the future increase of the 
shells, unless they could be removed from that part which it is intended to 
cover ; the animal, therefore, is furnished with the means, probably by a 
solvent liquor, of eating away the lower part of these spines, so that they 
become detached, and fall oft\ by the time that he is ready to form his new 
inner lip upon the space which they occupy, thus forming a comparatively 
smooth and even surface, on which it is to spread the testaceous matter, 
of which the addition to his building is composed." 

Clausula {clausus, closed ; from a little elastic shelly bone, whose func- 
tion appears to be to close up the aperture when the animal has with- 
drawn itself within the shell) ; three species. " This genus, which is 
terrestrial, consists wholly of small shells, the largest species we know 
scarcely exceeding an inch in length. Several of the species are common 
in this country ; in the southern parts of Europe, particularly the islands 
of the Mediterranean, they appear to abound to profusion."

beautifully coloured Figures, taken from living specimens in the Author's 
Collection. The Drawings by E. D. Smith. London. 8vo. Nos. I. to III. 
This little work is so far valuable, as it makes us intimately acquainted 
with a genus of songsters which, however much admired in our groves and 
thickets during the midsummer months, yet, from their retired habits during 
their annual visit, are not readily distinguished, and never before have been 
80 familiarly described. Mr. Sweet has already described the Sylvia rubfe- 
tra, the furze-chat ; S. Phoenicurus, the redstart ; S. Luscinia, the nightin- 
gale ; S. hort^nsis, the greater pettichaps j S. cinerea, the larger white- 
throat; S. 7V6chilus, the yellow willow-wren; S. hippolkis, the lesser 
pettichaps; S. sylvi^lla, the lesser white-throat ; S. atricapilla, the black-cap ;

S. syMcola, the wood-wren ; and the S. provinci^lis, the Dartford warbler ; 
all of which he has figured. To these will be added, in continuation, Syl- 
via locust^lla, the grasshopper-warbler ; S. phragmites, the sedge-warbler; 
S. arundinacea, the reed-wren; S. (EnWhe, the wheat-ear; and the Sylvia 
rubicola, the stone-chat. 

Besides scientific descriptions, Mr. Sweet has added interesting particu- 
lars of their nature, powers of song, and directions for catching and keeping 
them in health all the year round.

These works are analysed monthly in detail in the Gardener's Magazine, 
on account of the remarks on their culture, which would be of no use in a 
work like the present. We shall here, therefore, confine ourselves to 
enumerating and occasionally figuring those species which have been newly 
introduced to our gardens or herbariums, or such as are still rare, or in 
some way or other calculated to be interesting or remarkable to the 
naturalist. At no period has this country stood any thing like so high, in 
botanical periodicals, as at present ; and at no former period were so many 
new plants yearly introduced to the country. Mr. Barclay, of Bury Hill, 
has, for a number of years past, annually received the seeds of many new 
species, from his correspondents in South America and India, which are 
%ured as they come into flower, in different works ; but especially in those 
of Mr. Sweet. Mr. William Baxter, the collector of Mr. Henchman, sent 
to the Clapton nursery, a few years ago, one of the richest collections, 
from New Holland, that have been brought from that country since the time 
of Mr. Brown's visit ; and these are figured, described, and named, as they 
come into flower, by Mr. Sweet, in his FVora Australdsica. Mr. Douglas 
has sent home, to the Horticultural Society, more new and beautiful hardy 
herbaceous plants, from North America, than were ever before introduced 
by an individual from any country. These are beautifully figured in the 
Botanical Register^ and are the more valuable as being fit for the open 
garden in every part of the island. A number of other collectors and 
patrons might be named ; and perhaps the king's garden at Kew should not 
be omitted, though it is to be regretted that tiiere should be such a want 
of community of feeling between the heads of that establishment and the 
other British patrons of botany. A number of collectors have been sent, 
at the king's expense, to different parts of the world ; and many new plants 
have been introduced and flowered at Kew. Few of these, however, have 



Botanical Periodicals, 



59 



been figured in any of our periodicals ; and not a few of them, it is generally 
alleged, have been lost to science, and to the country, after being introduced, 
from having neither been perpetuated by the press, nor by dissemination 
among botanical cultivators. Of late, however, since the editorship of 
Curtis's Botanical Magazine was committed to Dr. Hooker, some plants 
have been figured in it from Kew ; and we should be most happy to see 
their number increased. A different policy from that liberality of sentiment 
and action, which may now be said to pervade almost every private and 
public establishment or institution of this country, is sure to carry with 
It its own reward. The names of various other individuals, patrons, and 
collectors, who have rendered essential service to botany, will occur in the 
course of our future botanical notices. 

Curtis^s Botanical Magazine^ and the Botanical Register, have both ma- 
terially improved within the last year. The Botanical Register, from con- 
taining most or all of the new plants introduced by the Horticultural 
Society, from the great care with which its plates are executed, and the 
judicious remarks on culture and general habit, by Mr. Lindley, is, in con- 
sequence, the superior publication. We should like to see both of them 
further improved by their editors' giving the accentuations, derivations, in- 
dications, and literal English names, in the manner which we have done in 
the Gardener'' s Magazine, and in the present work. If we were the public 
we should insist on this being done; and we rather wonder that Mr. 
Lindley, whom we know to be infinitely superior to the mean feeling of 
taking offence at our hints, has not, before this time, adopted these im- 
provements. 

The most curious plant in the 
Botanical Magazine is the A^mra 
campanulatum {fig. 27.), which 
is cultivated in the East Indies, 
as the yam is in the West, for its 
root. The rarest plant figured 
is the Bignonta Colfei, elsewhere 
noticed, (p. 67.) The common 
annual globe amaranth has 
found a place here, as some 
camellias and picotee carna- 
tions did in former numbers, 
which we cannot help regret- 
ting, as unsuitable to a botan- 
ical publication of the first rank. __ 

The Botanical Register ^ besides some beantlful new plants by Mr. 

DouglasL, from the N.W. coast of 
North America, contains the Diospyrus 
Mahbla {fig. 28.), a shrub or small tree 
from the Philippine Islands, producing 
a hard, compact, excessively black kind 
of ebony ; and a fruit, something like 
a large quince, described as covered 
with a bright brown coat, which encloses 
a pink or rose-coloured flesh. Its 
flavour is said to be agreeable, and its 
qualities wholesome. There are only 
two plants in England; one at Kew, 
and the other in the Horticultural 
Society's garden at Chiswick. The 
figure in the Register from which 
ours is copied, is of the quarto size, 
from a drawing by Mr. Lindley.

One of Mr. Douglas's new plants is CEnoth^ra 
pallida, a handsome creeping-rooted hardy 
perennial, well calculated for coming into 
universal culture. A good idea of the plant may 
be formed from a figure of CEnoth^ra speciosa. 
ijlg.29.) 

Loddiges*s Botanical Cabinet, contains ten 
figures, one or two of which are new plants, and 
some of the others curious old ones. StapHia 
stellaris (jtfg. 30.) is 
rather a scarce spe- , 
cies of a family very 
numerous in the de- 
serts between the 
ridges of mountains 
above the Cape of 

Good Hope, and which, with other suc- 
culent plants, are, by their fleshy struc- 
ture and having scarcely any pores in their 
cuticle, enabled to retain water sufficient to 
enable them to survive the long periods of 
drought which prevail in those regions. The 
plants of this genus are, to the eye of a com- 
mon observer, without leaves, these being sub- 
stituted by scale-like protuberances on the 
branches. The flowers may be considered as 
large in proportion to the size of the plant, the latter being seldom 
above a foot high. They have a singular character of richness in colour 
and succulency of texture, and smell strongly of sulphurated hydrogen or 
carrion. Only two species of this genus were known to Linnaeus in 1762. 
In our Hortus Britdnnicus 200 species are enumerated as cultivated in Bri- 
tain, or having been intro- v\% / 
ducedintoit. — £uph6rbia ^-^X^ansiii ^ 52 6 

ckput Medus<p. (^.51. a). 
This plant also is a native of 
Africa, and belongs to a fa- 
mily of which there are up- 
wards of 100 species. It is 
called Medusa's head from 
the circumstance of the prin- 
cipal shoots or branches pro- 
ducing from their extremities 
numerous small branches all 
round a sort of head which 
is formed there. These small 
branches (A), in conformity 
with the general tendency 
of the mind to compare ideas, and the taste of the early part of the 
eighteenth century, when the plant was discovered, for allusions to 
classical antiquity, were supposea to bear a resemblance to the snakes, 
instead of locks of hair, with which the head of the Gorgon Medusa 
was invested by the Greek mythology. All the species of Euphdrhia 
abound in a milky fluid, which is exceedingly acrid, and will raise blisters 
on the skin. That of an annual British species, E. Aelioscopia, or 
Sun Spurge, is used by country people to destroy warts ; that of E. c^put 
Medii8<7, now before us, is said, when thickened, to make a very good 
birdlime.

The object of this work is to give an epitome of the discoveries in na- 
tural history, and an account of the works published on the subject, in 
every part of the world. It forms a section of a plan, which embraces all 
the sciences, and for comprehensiveness of intention at least, has never 
before been equalled. The execution of such a plan necessarily requires 
a union of scientific knowledge, talent, and industry rarely effected, 
and the director has taken the only means in human power to combine 
these requisites, that of appointing an editor for each department. 
The work, we believe, has hitherto been conducted as well as could be 
expected, and may be considered as essential to the scientific naturalist, 
whatever may be his country. We shall have recourse to it in common 
with other foreign works, in order to make known to our readers the pro- 
gress of natural history generally throughout the world, and particularly 
on the Continent.

KfLOM of Great Britain. — Dr. Greville is engaged in preparing forpub- 
Kcation a work, in one volume 8vo, upon the A'\^ of Great Britain. As 
the author is desirous of rendering this most interesting department of 
botany as intelligible as possible, the genera will be carefully illustrated in 
twenty-five plates, and the descriptive letter-press written entirely in Eng- 
lish. In a distinct portion of the work, however, a synopsis will be given 
in Latin of all the known genera, exotic as well as British, and a systematic 
enumeration of all the known species. 

Medical and Physiological Essays are preparing for publication, by Dr. 
Forster, of Boreham, near Chelmsford. Among other curious articles they 
will contain an essay on the botany of the middle ages, and one on the 
phyuology of spectral illusions.

The facts, descriptions, or speculations intended to occupy this division of 
our work, are such as have more relation to natural history as a science, 
than to its progress in any particular place or country ; in other words, we 
devote this division to short communications, notices, extracts, or abridg- 
ments, of permanent interest, as distinguished from the Miscellaneous Intel- 
ligence composing Part IV., which is intended chiefly for what may be 
called news, or notices of local and temporary interest. This explanation 
of our arrangement will the better enable our friends and contributors to 
understand what will be acceptable, and will prove to every reader who is 
favourable to our undertaking, how easy it will be for him to render u» 
assistance. 



Art. I. The General Subject, 

The Circular Si/stem. — Now, there is incontestible evidence to prove 
that the same system which is found to govern the heavenly bodies — a 
system plainly circular — is typically represented on earth, and is that upon 
which the whole of organised matter has originally been planned. If either 
the animal or the vegetable kingdom be attentively considered, they will 
each present a certain number of primary divisions, following each other 
in a series of affinity. They will also have this remarkable peculiarity, 
that the last will so intimately resemble the first, that the series returns 
again to the point from which the investigation commenced ; and thus by 
the union of the first division with the last, the whole can only be repre- 
sented under the form of a circle. Again, if any one of these primary 
divisions be examined singly, the same disposition will be found ; each of 
these secondary groups will form their own circles of affinity. These again 
are found to contain smaller circles, till at last the enquiry becomes 
limited to the individual species. (Swainson, in the Winter's Wreath for 
1828, p. 295.) ^^ \ ^ y^Sl-r 

Spontaneous Organisation of Matter. — M. Bory de St. Vincent has oc- 
cupied himself for some time past with a variety of microscopic observa- 
tions, having for their object to prove the natural tendency of matter to 
become organised. Observing the appearances successively presented in 
water exposed to light, he thought he saw, for the first time, matter assume 
the aspect of a simple mucosity, without colour or form. If the water con- 
tains any animal substance, it produces a pellicle of this mucosity at its sur- 
face, then becomes turbid, and discloses an infinity of living atoms, if we 
may so call those monads, which, after being magnified a thousand times, 
are not so large as the point of a needle, and which yet move in all directions 
with prodigious velocity. This is what M. Bory names matter in the liv- 
ing state. When the water is exposed to the air and light, there quickly 
forms what is named the green matter of Priestley, which many observers 
have supposed to be the first state of certain confervae, or plants of a like 
nature. M. Bory thinks that it is a combination of a more general form, 
and only susceptible of entering into the composition of these plants, a 
well as of the animalcules which issue from it, and which produces them.

He names this combination matter in the vegetative state. It is by it that 
the infusory animals are rendered green. Those which colour oysters, ac- 
cording to M. Gaillon's observations, produce this effect, as M. Bory says, 
only because they are themselves coloured by the green matter. It colours, 
in the same manner, the water and the shells of these oysters ; and it would 
not be impossible to find some tinged directly by this matter, without any 
animalcules having penetrated into them. {jam. Phil. Jour., Dec. 1827, 
p. 195) 

The French Philosophers of the present age have acquired great and 
deserved fame by their splendid discoveries in physiology, geology, and 
comparative anatomy ; but, as regards the natural system, or that which is 
to develope the plan of creation, it is not too much to say, that the book 
of nature, to them, has been hermetically sealed. Their discoveries will, 
indeed, remain, for these regard things which are immutable ; but their 
systems and theories, formed either without any reference to religion, or in 
direct opposition to its greatest truths, are even now fast tumbling to 
decay. They may, indeed, be remembered, but only as lamentable instances 
of the infirmity of our nature, which, taking not God for its guide, perverts 
his works to inculcate the baneful principles of materialism and infidelity.

A NEW kind of Cloth fabricated hy Insects. — The larvae of the butterfly, 
Tfnea punctata, or T. padilla, have been directed by M. Habenstreet, of 
Munich, so as to work on a paper model suspended from the ceiling of a 
room. To this model he can give any form and dimensions, and he has 
thus been enabled to obtain square shawls, an air balloon four feet high, 
and a woman's complete robe, with the sleeves, but without seams. One 
or two larvae can weave a square inch of cloth. A great number are, of 
course, employed, and their motions are interdicted from the parts of the 
model not to be covered by oiling them. The cloth exceeds in fineness 
the lightest gauze, and has been worn as a robe over her court dress by the 
Queen of Bavaria. {Newton's Journal of the Arts, Dec. 1827.) — We have 
no doubt the same object might be effected by directing the labours of the 
larvae of various British moths or butterflies, or perhaps spiders ; and we 
should be glad to hear of some reader of leisure attempting such a thing. 
M. Samouelle, Blackfriars Road, we believe, could give instructions, and 
supply eggs and larvae. — Cond. 

Method of killing Insects for the Use of Naturalists. — The following me- 
thod is by M. Ricord : — The insect is to he fixed on a piece of cork, and 
put under ajar or vessel with a little ether; the latter being placed either 
in a capsule, or on the plate on which the jar or glass is placed : the vessel 
should apply closely, that the vapour of the ether may be retained, and the 
air within be prevented from changing its place. The insect thus im- 
mersed in the ethereal atmosphere will soon die, without having time to hurt 
its form or appearance by violence. (Bui. Un.) 

The Ant and the A'phis, or Plant Louse. — Mr. Carpenter happening 
once to beat down a number of Aphides out of a stunted oak-tree, at the 
foot of which was an ants' nest, was very much surprised at seeing soon 
afterwards the ants busily employed in carrying up the dphides and care- 
fully replacing them again upon the leaves of tne tree ; they feeding upon 
the honey-dew, which, it is well known, is produced by the aphis. (Giltt

Botany, 67 

Art. III. Botany. 

Tabasheer (the Arabic word for liquor) is a very remarkable substance, 
occurring only in particular situations and in particular plants, and chiefly 
in the joints of the bamboo. It is called by the Hindoo physicians bamboo 
manna, and milk, sugar, or camphor of bamboo, and appears to be a secretion 
from the joints of the seed in a state of disease, malconformation, or 
fracture. The secretion is made in the cavity within the reed, and on the 
upper and under surface of the joints ; the ordinary quantity produced by 
a disorganised joint or internode, is four or five grains. The chemical 
composition of tabasheer is undetermined ; it is pure silex, according to 
some ; and silex 70, and potash 50, according to others. According to an 
analysis by Dr. Turner, Professor of Chemistry in the University of London, 
in the April number of Brewster* s Journal, it consists of silica, containing a 
minute quantity of lime and vegetable matter. The physical properties of 
tabasheer are remarkable ; its refractive power is lower than that of any 
other body, when solid or fluid; with certain oils, which it imbibes, it be- 
comes as transparent as glass; it absorbs water, and becomes as white and 
opaque as if it had been covered with white lead. In India it is used 
medicinally as a tonic, or chewed with betel, to renovate the constitution. 
It is also highly prized as an aphrodisiac. Silex, it is well known, exists in 
wheat straw, and in the stems of other grasses ; physiologists, in general, 
consider it as a foreign ingredient, " an intruding element which the plant 
had derived from the peculiar soil in which it vegetated ; " but Dr. Brewster, 
from certain experiments made with jBquisetum hiemale, is of opinion that 
the silex is an integral portion of the plant itself. {Brewster's Jour. ^ k\)r\\.) 

Botany in the Mauritius. — Sir Galbraith Lowry Cole, the governor, 
has appointed that indefatigable botanist, Mr. Bojer, Professor of Botany 
in the Royal College at Port Louis. The 
governor, as well as Lady Cole, have done 
every thing in their power to aid the cause of 
botany; and have encouraged the transmission 
of plants to Europe to a very great extent. 
Professor Hooker has lately published in the 
Botanical Magazine {April, 1828) a beautiful 
species of Bignonia, named in honour of the 
governor by Mr. Bojer, in testimony of his re- 
spect and gratitude. Bignonia Col^? (^g. 36.) 
is a shrub reaching to the height of from 10 
to 15 feet, and bearing red flowers on the 
main stem remote from the leaves. The plant 
itself has not yet been introduced into Britain, 
but may soon be expected at Bury Hill. 

J^e Krubut, or Great Flower of Sumatra. — Rafflesm (in honour of the 
late Sir Stamford Raffles, governor of Sumatra, and founder of the Zoolo- 
gical Society) Arnoldw (in memory of Dr. Arnold, the discoverer in 1818), 
is one of the most extraordinary of vegetable productions. It is a parasite, 
growing in woods, on the roots and stems of those immense climbers, gene- 
rally of the genus Titis, which are attached, like cables, to the largest 
trees in the forest. The flower constitutes the whole of the plant, there 
being neither leaves, roots, nor a stem. It is a true parasite, growing out 
of another plant in the manner of the mistletoe, and not on the decayed 
surface of plants, as the common fern on the trunks of old oak pollards. 
In the latter case the proper term is epiphyte {epi, upon, pkyfon, a 
plant). The flowers are of one sex, and only the male has yet been sent to 
England. The breadth of a full-grown flower (fg. 37.) exceeds 3 ft. ; the 
petals (a), which are subrotund, measure 12 in. from the base to the apex,

and it is about a foot from the insertion of the one petal to the opposite 
one ; what is considered the nectarium {b) would hold 12 pints; the pistils, 




which are abortive {fig. 37. d), are as large as cows' horns, and the weight 
of the whole is calculated to be about 15 lbs. The flower, fully blown, 
was discovered in a jungle, growing close to the ground under the bushes, 
with a swarm of flies hovering over the nectary, and apparently laying 
their eggs in its substance. The colour of the five petals is a brick red, 
covered with protuberances of a yellowish white. The smell is that of 
tainted beef. The structure of Rafflesfa is too imperfectly known to admit 
of determining its place in the natural system ; but Mr. Brown, from 
whose learned paper on the subject, in the Linnean transactions, this notice 
is taken, is inclined to think it will be found to approach either to Asarinae 
or Passifloreae. Its first appearance is that of a round knob {fig. 38.) pro- 
ceeding from a crack or hollow in the 
stern or root. This knob, when cut 
through, exhibits the infant flower en- 
veloped in numerous bracteal sheaths, 
which successively open and wither away 
as the flower enlarges, until, at the time 
of full expansion {fig.Zl.^ there are but 
a very few remaining, which have some- 
what the appearance of a broken calyx. 
{fig. 37. c.) It takes three months from 
the first appearance of the bud to the 
full expansion of the flower. The fruit has not yet been seen by botanists, 
but is said by the natives, to be a many-seeded berry. The female flower 
differs little in appearance from the male, further than being without the 
anthers {fig. 37. e) of the latter. In Mr. Brown's observations on RaflS^sia, 
he observes, that it is not common for parasite plants to fix indiscriminatelv 
on the roots or branches of their stocks, as is supposed to be the case with 
RafHesia, and that " plants parasitic on roots, are chiefly distinguishable by 
the imperfect developement of their leaves, and the entire absence of green 
colour ; that their seeds are small, and their embryo not only minute, but 
S4)parently imperfectly developed." The modes of union between a para- 
site and its supporter or stock, vary in different genera and species of this 
class of vegetables. Some, as the mistletoe and RaflH^sfa, depend on the 
stock for nourishment during the whole of their existence; others, as the 
common broom rape, are originated in the soil, and afterwards, when they 
have attached themselves to their stock, the original roots die ; other pa- 
rasites, again, are originated on the stock, and in their more advanced state 
produce roots of theii own. In some cases the nature of the connection 




Mineralogj/ and Geologi/. 



69 



between the parasite and the stock is such, " as can only be explained on 
the supposition, that the germinating seed of the parasite excites a specific 
action in the stock, the result of which is the formation of a structure, 
either wholly or in part derived from the root, and adapted to the support 
and protection of the undeveloped parasite ; analogous, therefore, to the 
production of galls by the puncture of insects." On this supposition may 
be explained, the connection between the flower Rafflbia and the root 
from whence it springs. {Trans. Lin. Soc, vol. xiii. p. 227.)

Colour of the Red Sea. — The colour of the Red Sea has given rise to 
various investigations. Dr. Ehrenberg, who accompanied Dr. Hetnprich, 
ascertained that it was caused by a species of Oscillatoria, one of those 
small plants which are intermediate between animals and plants. {Jam. 
Phil. Jour., Dec. 1827, p. 182.) 

Footmarks of Animals in Sandstone. — Numerous impressions of the foot- 
steps of quadrupeds have been discovered on a bed of red sandstone, near 
Lochmaben, in Dumfriesshire, between 60 and 70 ft. beneath the surface. 
Professor Buckland, to whom specimens of them have been sent, has given it 
as his opinion, that they were produced by the feet of a tortoise or croco- 
dile, at a time when the rock was in a soft state, and before the 60 or 70 ft. 
of solid strata with which it is now covered had been superimposed. {Ibid.) 

Fossil Shell attached to Flint. — Dear Sir, I enclose a sketch of a fossil 
shell attached to a flint {fig. 39.), which I found, some time ago, at Ditch- 
ingham, in this 
neighbourhood. I 
can offer yon no 
theory, or other 
information re- 
specting it. 

About a year 
and a half ago, as 
some workmen 
were digging in a 
gravel pit at Wort- 
well, within four 
miles of this place, 
they found the 
fragment of an 
elephant's tooth, 
weighing upwards 
of 3^ lbs. It was 
about 40 feet be- 
low the surface. This and the flint are in the possession of J. B. Scott, 
Esq. 1 am, dear Sir, &c. — Daniel Stock. Bungay, April 1 . 1828. 

The specimen figured by our correspondent, is evidently the fossil bivalve 
Inoc^ramus. No less than twelve species have been described by natural- 
ists, of which three are peculiar to the upper chalk j four are common to the 
chalk and the subjacent green sand ; one to the green sand and blue marl ; 
one to the oak-tree clay ; one other species common to the oak-tree clay, 
Falkstone marl, and green sand ; one to the alum strata ; and one to the 
mountain limestone. The species here represented appears to be a small 
variety of Inoc^ramus Cuvieri of Sowerby, lab. 441. {fig. 40.) This genus is 
abundantly found in the diluvial gravel of the eastern counties, some frag-

ments showing that the shells, in some cases, attained to considerable di- 
mensions. Others are not more / s 
than a fourth of the size figured, 
and, from the circumstance of 
being commonly found in 
groups, show the gregarious 
habits o. the fish in their ori- 
ginal state. In the diluvium 
of Norfolk and Suffolk, they 
rarely occur in any other form 
than as casts in flint, or hard 
chalk, or occasionally with a 
fragment of the shell only ad- 
hering to the chalk nodules. 
These are dispersed in every 
part of this district, being found 
equally on the highest eminences 
and on the margins of the val- 
leys. We give ready insertion to the communication of Mr. Stock, not 
because we attach an unnecessary importance to the present article, but 
from the desire to encourage local contributions, and notices of occasional 
discoveries in this or in any other department of natural science. The 
fossil elephant's tooth, and, judging from its locality, the Inoceramus also, 
are derived from the diluvial valley of the Waveney, which has afforded 
numerous specimens of the remains of animals, particularly in the higher 
parts, in the neighbourhood of Eye, Hoxne, Diss, Roydon, &c., and there 
.is little doubt that similar relics exist, but have attracted little observation, 
in every portion of this valley. Agricultural and domestic operations, such 
as digging drains in meadows and marshes, sinking wells, and excavating 
gravel-pits, are favourable to such discoveries ; and the communication of 
the circumstances, from local observers, leads to a useful concentration of 
geological facts. Our correspondent will oblige us by continuing his observ- 
ations. We would suggest his endeavouring to trace the crag-beds in this 
direction. They seem to exist without the shells, or with slight indications 
of them, in the vicinity of Beccles and more westerly, and have been met 
with in the diluvium of the gravel-pits much higher up. Mr. R. C. Taylor 
has sketched the geological character of the Waveney valley, in his work 
on the geology of East Norfolk, with reference to the hypothesis of Mr. 
Robherds, on the supposed gradual sinking in the level of the German 
ocean. 

Temperature of the Interior of the Earth. — A very interesting paper on 
this subject, by M. L. Cordier, Professor of Geology in the Garden of 
Plants at Paris, will be found in Professor Jameson's Journal for April. 
From numerous experiments made by himself and others in mines, M. Cor- 
dier concludes, — 1 . that there is a subterraneous heat peculiar to the terres- 
trial globe, which does not depend on the solar rays, and which increases 
rapidly with the depth ; 2. the increase of this heat does not follow the 
same law all over the earth, it may be twice or three times as much in one 
country as in another; 3. these differences are not in constant relation with 
longitudes and latitudes ; and, 4. the increase is more rapid than has been 
supposed. 

It is proper to state that the opinions maintained by the author are not 
new. The value of the memoir lies in its placing on a firm scientific basis 
what was formerly a mere hypothesis. M. Cordier, after much research, 
holds that an intense heat exists in the interior of the earth, that the ex- 
ternal crust upon which we stand may be from 50 to 100 miles in thickness, 
that beyond this all within is occupied by a molten mass ; he infers further, 
that the entire globe consisted originally of such a molten mass, the outer 



Meteorology, 



71 



part of which became solid first, by throwing off its heat into the regions 
of free space; that by the continual escape of heat in this way, the solid 
crust is constantly thickening; that the earth, in short, is a cooled star, 
which has been extinguished only at its surface. 

We cannot but regard this as one of the most curious and important 
truths ever given to the world ; a truth which, though it lias no immediate 
bearing on the arts of life, cannot be barren of useful consequences, since 
it gives us more correct ideas of the globe we inhabit, and promises to 
throw a flood of light on many abstruse and difficult questions in science.

Burmese Petroleum Wells. — Some of these are from 37 to 53 tathoms 
in depth, and are said to yield at an average, daily, from 130 to 185 gallons 
of the earth oil. The wells are scattered over an area of about sixteen 
square miles. The wells are private property, the owners paying a tax of 
5 per cent, of the produce to the state. This commodity is almost uni- 
versally used by the Burmans as lamp oil. Its price on the spot does not, 
on an average, exceed from 5d. to 7^d. per cwt. The other useful mineral 
or saline productions of the Burman empire are coal, saltpetre, soda, and 
culinary salt. One of the lakes affording the latter, which is within six or 
seven miles of the capital, was examined by the gentlemen of the mission.

A Rain-Gauge, on a new and 
greatly improved construction 
(fig. 4 1 .) has been invented by 
Mr. Samuel Crosley, Engineer, 
London, and described in Gill's 
Technological Repository, vol. ii. 
p. 17. Its superiority consists in 
its power of self-registering the 
quantity of rain fallen. It con- 
sists of a funnel (a) of the Usual form, through which the rain passes to a 
vibrating trough (b), when, after a sufficient quantity has fallen into its higher 
side (c), it preponderates, discharges the rain, which escapes by a tube, and 
at the same time, by its vibratory action, moves a train of wheel-work and 
indexes, to record upon a dial-plate the quantity of rain fallen. We have 
not been able to learn that any instruments of this sort are actually on 
sale ; but the invention is most ingenious, and ranks with Kewley's balance 
thermometer [Enc. of Gard.,§ 1489.), which might also be made a register- 
ing thermometer on a similar principle. 

Destruction of an Oak Tree hy Lightning. — The trunk of the tree was 
about 15 ft. in height, 1| or 2 ft. in diameter at the branches, and 3 ft. in 
diameter at the root. The top of the tree was separated, as if by the stroke 
of a hatchet, and without any appearance of carbonisation ; the trunk was 
torn into a thousand pieces, exceedingly small in size when compared with 
the original mass, and thrown to a great distance Such was the division 
and destruction, as to induce the supposition that in certain cases the light- 
ning might cause the entire dispersion of the tree. (Bui. Un.) 

Rain at Bombay. — During the first days of the rainy season, the quan- 
tity that fell was thirty-two inches, and then all the roads became like 
rivers. In England, at an average, not more than the same quantity falls 
during the whole year. (Jam. Jour., Dec. 1827, p. 182.)

of plants, collected during his travels in Nubia and Egypt ; 2. drawings of 
the fishes, insects, and testaceous animals found in the Nile and its neigh-

tions. This collection is the fruit of several years' research into the doc- 
trines of Gall, relative to the seat of the moral and intellectual faculties of 
man and animals. We are informed that M. Vimon, after having attended 
Dr. Gall's course of lectures at Paris, left it with strong prepossessions 
against his doctrines, and on his return to Caen, prosecuted his researches 
with the express object of refuting them ; but, after the fullest investigation,

professor and pastor at Nyon, which is now completed in manuscript, and 
will form six volumes ; the first of which is published, and the remainder 
will shortly appear. An interesting preface gives an account of the author's 
excursions during this long period, among the valleys and mountains of 
Switzerland. The author has followed the Linnean system ; he is an enemy 
to the multiplication of species, and even thinks he has hardly gone far 
enough in reducing their number. He says, " F'ateor etiam nunc, in mea 
Flora non paucas superesse formas, quae omnino varietatis potius quam spe- 
ciei lege describi debuissent." ** I confess, that in my Flora, even now, there 
remain not a few modifications which should be described as varieties rather 
than as species." A number of copper-plates, representing new species, are 
added to the work. {For. Quart. Rev., February.)

RUSSIA, 

Oural Mountains. — M. Engelhardt, professor of the university, has 
just returned to that city from a visit to the Oural Mountains, which he 
performed at the expense of the university. He has presented a very 
interesting report of his journey, of which he intends publishing a detailed 
narrative. He has made a great number of valuable observations on the 
geology and mineralogy of these countries ; and has been enabled to cor- 
rect, in many important particulars, the maps of the several provinces which 
he visited. {For. Quart. Rev., February.) 

Altai Mountains. — Another tour in Asia has been performed by Profes- 
sor Ledebuhr, Dr. Meyer, and Dr. Bunge, to the Altai mountains, on the 
frontiers of the Chinese empire. This tour, the object of which was the 



' 74 Natural Historic in Lojidon. 

almost unknown Flora of those remote regions, has proved eminently 
successful. The travellers have collected 1600 species of plants, of which 
nearly 500 are new ; so that Professor Ledebuhr intends to publish a Flora 
Altdica. Geography, statistics, zoology, and mineralogy were not neglected 
in the course of this excursion ; the narrative of which is expected to be 
highly interesting, and will be published, as we are informed, first in Eng- 
lish. {For. Quart. Rev., February.) 

Natural History of Siberia. — At the commencement of this month, Hum- 
boldt, the great naturalist and traveller, proposes to undertake a journey 
to Siberia, for the purposes of scientific research ; to which object the Em- 
peror Nicholas has contributed, by directing that every facility be afforded 
to the philosopher in his meritorious pursuits. {AthencBum.)

Ornithologt/. — A splendid work on this subject is publishing at Philadel- 
phia, by Charles Lucien Bonaparte, in folio numbers. It is the continu- 
ation of an equally splendid work by the late zealous and indefatigable 
Wilson. The birds figured by Bonaparte have, for the most part, been 
obtained from the Rocky Mountains ; and the first volume, which was 
completed in 1825, contains nine plates, on which 22 land birds are figured, 
and 106 pages of letter-press, in which they are described. The same 
author has published a verj' useful and necessary appendix to Wilson's work, 
entitled. Observations on the Nomenclature of Wilson's Ornithology. Taking 
these works, in connection with the surpassingly splendid Birds of America 
of M. Audubon; the riches of the new world, in this department, promise 
to be fully and favourably made known to the old. 

The Reynains of a stupendous Crocodile were seen near New Orleans by 
Mr. Bullock. The animal must have been at least 150 ft. long, for Mr.

along the curve, and 4 h. 6 in. wide. {Builocfc's Travels.) 



Art. II. Natural History in London, 

The British Museum was opened to the public in 1759, with the exten- 
sive collection of the celebrated Sir Hans Sloane. The additions it has 
since received by purchase and donation are numerous and extensive. 
The history of this institution is already sufficiently well known, and there- 
fore we propose merely to notice from time to time such additions as may 
be made to the natural history department, or new regulations respecting 
the admission of the public to view or study the various collections of 
natural objects and the books treating of them. The library of the late 
Sir Joseph Banks is the last grand addition that was made to the natural 
history department, having been removed thither in November, 1827. 

lAnnean Society. — This Society was founded in 1788. At its opening a 
discourse, published in the first volume of the Society's Transactions^ was 
read by tlie president, the late Sir J. E. Smith, on the rise and progress of 
natural history, in which the peculiar objects of this institution are pointed 
out. These may be summed up as attention to natural history in general, 
a particular regard to the productions of the British Isles, and a strict 
attention to the laws and principles of Linnaeus, so far as they have been 
found to be good. The Society nave just completed their 15th volume of 
Transactions, and the number of members now exceeds 600.

April 15. Read, a letter, addressed to the Secretary, from Charles 
Lucien Buonaparte, Prince of Mesignano, F.M.L.S., dated on board the 
Delaware, near Gibraltar, March 20^ 1828, containing some curious facts 
relative to the migratory habits of certain birds. He observes, " A few days 
ago, being 500 miles from the coasts of Portugal, 400 from those of Africa, 
&c., we were agreeably surprised by the appearance of a few swallows, 
^irundo urbicaand rustica. This, however extraordinary, might have been 
explained by an easterly gale, which might have cut off the swallows mi- 
grating from the main to Madeira, only 200 miles distant from us ; but 
what was my surprise in observing several small warblers hopping about 
the deck and rigging ! These poor little strangers, exhausted as they were, 
were soon caught and brought to me." These warblers consisted ol Sylvia, 
Trochilus, ^rfthacus suecica, or a nearly related species; and a fourth, pro- 
bably a nondescript, having the plumage of an A'rthus. 

Read, also, part of a valuable physiological paper, on the mammary

Among the presents were two va- 
luable additions to the Society's New

specimen of that curious quadruped, 
the Diadelphis wrsina (Linn. Tran., vol.

Bay Devil (fg. 42.), and a remarkable 
new species of Falco, with a crest ; both 
presented by Mr. B. Leadbeater, F.L.S. 
Captain Ross, R.N. F.L.S., presented a small collection of dried plants, 
formed by himself in the late arctic expedition under Captain Parry. 

Geological Society/. — The anniversary of this institution, established, as 
its charter states, " to investigate the mineral structure of the earth," 
was held on the 1 5th of February. An address on the occasion was de- 
livered from the chair, by W. H. Fitton, M.D. F.R.S. &c., the president, 
which will be found at length in the Philosophical Magazine for April. The 
leading feature of the address is the state of geology in Britain, though no- 
tice is also taken of the progress of the science in other countries. Refer- 
ence is made to the printed Proceedings of the Society, and their Transac- 
tionsy as the best records of the Society's contributions to geological science 
during the year. The Society are congratulated on the progress which has 
been made in the trigonometrical survey of Ireland, because the greatest 
benefit is derived to geology from good maps. The effective establishment 
of a Zoological Society is another source of gratification, because to the 
geologist it is of great importance to have ready access to cabinets, and to 
living specimens, in order to elucidate fossil' remains of animals and plants. 
The fossil remains of the vegetable kingdom do not occupy, the President 
thinks, a just share of the attention of the botanists of England. " The 
distribution of plants upon the former surfaces of the globe, — its relation 
to the epochs of geological deposition, — the variations it may have 
undergone from change of climate, either by alteration of internal tempe- 
rature, or of elevation above the sea — the former existence of vegetation 
m the more complex forms, in tracts where scarcely any traces of it 





76 Natural History in London. 

exist at present, — are subjects which give rise to some of the most im- 
portant general questions connected with the history of the globe, — 
and that require for their due consideration such an acquaintance with the 
characters of fossil vegetable remains, as none but the most skilful and 
experienced botanists can be expected to possess." Notice is taken of 
several valuable papers on the geology of foreign countries, of the donation 
of various specimens to the museum, and of some valuable publications to 
the library. 

" In the speculative department of geology, nothing has been of late 
more remarkable, with reference to its history in this country, than the 
universal adoption of a modified volcanic theory, and the complete subsi- 
dence or almost oblivion of the Wernerian and Neptunean hypotheses, — 
so that what, but a few years since, it was by some considered as hardihood 
to propose in the form of conjecture, seems now to be established nearly 
with the evidence of fact. It is no longer denied, that volcanic power has 
been active during all the revolutions which the surface of the globe has 
undergone, and has probably been itself the cause of many of them ; — 
and that our continents have not merely been shaken by some mighty 
subterraneous force, but that strata, originally horizontal, have thus been 
raised, shattered, contorted, and traversed, perhaps repeatedly, by veins 
of fluid matter ; — operations which have produced phenomena, so nearly 
resembling those of recent volcanic agency, that to have so long disputed 
the identity of their cause, is one of the most remarkable proofs in the 
annals of philosophic history, of the power of hypothesis in distorting 
or concealing truth. Whatever, therefore, be the fate of the Hut- 
tonian theory in general, it must be admitted, that many of its leading 
propositions have been confirmed in a manner which the inventor could 
not have foreseen. The most striking modern support of these correcter 
views, is due to Von Buch and Humboldt, and to the facts and inferences 
derived by Dr. MaccuUoch from the country which gave birth to Hutton, 
and to his illustrator Mr. Playfair, and in which were made the experi- 
ments of Sir James Hall. More recently, a seiies of facts observed by 
Professor Henslow, in the Isle of Anglesea, has proved, in the most satis- 
factory manner, the connection of veins of trap with very high tempe- 
rature; since the change produced upon the strata, through which the 
substances now occupying the veins were injected, has approached so 
nearly to fluidity, as to admit of their crystallisation, in forms different 
from any which the components of the rocks, if they had not been thus 
acted on, would have aflbrded. Sir Humphrey Davy's experiments on the 
fluids contained within cavities in crystals, are another striking and unex- 
pected confirmation of Hutton's views : and our own Transactions, besides 
various incidental pieces of evidence derived from this country, supply the 
testimony of an unprejudiced witness to an earthquake on the coast of 
Chili, which brings almost before the eyes of the reader, the movement 
and permanent elevation of the land." 

The ^ood effects produced at both our universities by the geological 
instructions delivered there, have " given to the subject an impulse perhaps 
without example in the history of those institutions, and gone far to render 
natural science a permanent department of general education." Among 
the more recent causes which have accelerated the progress of geology in 
Eingland, is stated to be the publication of the Outlines of England and 
Wales by Mr. Conybeare and Mr. Phillips, which is said to have " had 
an effect, to which nothing, since the institution of this Society, and the 
diffusion of the geological maps of England, can be compared. Regard- 
ing the Outlines of England and Wales, as the first general sketch of a 
country so complex as our own, it may be said, without fear of contradic- 
tion, that no equal portion of the earth's surface has ever been more ably 
illustrated ; —nor any geological work produced, which bears more strongly 



Natural History in Lofidon. 77 

impressed upon it the stamp of original talent for natural science." The 
geology of England acquires a great additional interest, " when we reflect 
that this island is in a great measure an epitome of the globe ; and that the 
observer, who makes himself familiar with our strata and the fossil remains 
which they include, has not only prepared himself for similar enquiries in 
other quarters, but is already, as it were, acquainted by anticipation with 
what he is to find there. If, therefore, I were called upon to state m what 
manner those who have leisure, health, and talent for such enquiries, can 
most effectually advance the bounds of our sciences, and increase the 
reputation which England has begun to acquire in this department of 
natural knowledge, J should say, that it would be, — first, by rendering 
themselves accurately familiar with the geological phenomena of our own 
country; and then, by taking abroad with them the knowledge thus 
acquired, and comparing the phenomena with those of distant regions; 
since it is only from the multiplication of such comparisons that sound 
general views can be derived. 

•* But there are still tracts in the British islands, the geology of which is 
little known ; more than one half of Ireland is in this condition, and no 
geological map has yet appeared of Scotland, rich and varied as that region 
is in a geological point of view. 

" To those amongst us who are confined to England, the inost useful 
task, perhaps, would be, when we have mastered the general relations of our 
series, to take some one portion of the subject ; a group of strata, or even 
a single stratum, or any one of the numberless questions connected with 
their zoological and minefalogical relations, and to publish, in the form of 
monographs, the results of our enquiries. For it may be stated with con- 
fidence, that there is not any one of our strata, however familiarly it may be 
supposed to be already known, that would not, if thus treated, reward the 
most elaborate and minute examination. 

" But those that are deprived of the privilege of travelling even in Eng- 
land, must not suppose that they can be of no service as geologists ; or, if 
they belong to our body, that they are thus relieved from their obligation 
to be active in our cause : and there are two descriptions of persons, — the 
resident clergy, and members of the medical profession in the country, from 
whom what I am about to say may be more particularly deserving of atten- 
tion. Such persons, if they have not yet acquired a taste for natural 
science, can hardly conceive the interest whict the face of the country, in 
their vicinity, would gain, however unpromising it may appear, by their 
having such enquiries before them ; how much the monotony of life, in a 
remote or thinly inhabited district, would thus be relieved ; nor how much 
benefit they might confer on the natural history of their country. Even of 
those who have made some progress in geological studies, many, I appre- 
hend, are prevented from investigating attentively the tracts where they 
reside, or from communicating their knowledge, by a belief that the geology 
of England itself is sufficiently known already ; and that the district, with 
the phenomena of which they are themselves familiar, would have no inte- 
rest or novelty for the world at large ; whereas it may be asserted (and it 
were easy to produce examples from modern researches, in some of the 
counties near London), that there is no district that will not furnish suffi- 
cient interest and novelty to an attentive enquirer, not merely to repay his 
own exertions, but to instruct the most learned, and enlarge the bounds of 
our science. 

" To landed proprietors, also, it can hardly be known, without some 
tinge of geological information, how nearly our subject is connected with 
agriculture ; with an acquaintance with the nature and correctives of the 
soil ; the supply of water and facility of effectual drainage, and numberless 
facts essential to the perfection of rural economy ; the discovery and supply 
of stone, for building and the construction of roads ; the choice of the hne 



78 Natural Hhtory in London. 

of roads and of canals, and the facility of their execution. All these are but 
a few of the topics that come strictly within the province of the geologist 
and which are so essential to the prosperous management of landed pro- 

f)erty, that a geological map may, perhaps, with truth, be considered as not 
ess necessary to the country gentleman, than the topographical plan of his 
estates." 

This discourse is an admirable specimen of what, in our opinion, ought to 
be delivered annually by the president of every literary and scientific insti- 
tution. It is true, not many, if any, of these could show that they have 
advanced their particular science or object so much as the Geological So- 
ciety has done ; but it would give the public a much better opportunity of 
judging than they now have, of the objects and efforts of such societies and 
institutions, if such annual summaries of their meetings and transactions 
were delivered to the members, and published to the world. It is evident, 
also, that such summary views would, in various ways, promote the pros- 
perity of such societies. 

The Society held two meetings in March, and two in April, at which 
some valuable papers were read. Of these, and of the Society's published 
Transactions, we shall afterwards give some account. {Phil. Mag. and 
An. of Phil.) 

The Zoological Society was founded in April, 1826. The house No. 33. 
Bruton Street, was taken in that year, and fitted up for the museum, and 
a plot of ground in the Regent's Park was obtained for exhibiting a living 
collection. Sir T. Stamford Raffles was the principal founder and the first 
president of this Society. The second meeting oi the Society took place 
m March, 1827, when, in consequence of the death of the president, the 
Marquess of Lansdown was chosen to that office. 

The museum in Bruton Street consists of several thousand animals or 
parts of animals, the greater part of which have been voluntarily con- 
tributed. Last year, the collection which Sir Stamford Raffles formed in 
Sumatra, some valuable Eastern animals, a remarkable collection of horns 
by Major General Hardwicke, an ostrich by the king, and a number of pre- 
sents by other individuals, were added, and during the present year various 
accessions have been made. 

In the Society's menagerie and garden, situated on the north-eastern side 
of the Regent's Park, not far beyond the new St. Catherine's Church and 
Hospital, nearly one hundred living animals are exhibited in suitable pad- 
docks, dens, and aviaries. Among the most attractive of these, are two 
beautiful llamas, one presented by the Duke of Bedford, the second by Ro- 
bert Barclay, Esq., of Bury Hill ; a leopard, presented by Lord Auckland ; 
some kangaroos bred in this country, by the Marquess of Hertford ; a pair 
of emus, bred at Windsor, by Lord Mountcharles ; a Russian bear, pre- 
sented by Lord Hertford. Specimens of the ratel, or Indian badger, ich 
neumons, tiger cats, badgers, monkeys, &c., add to the attractions of 
the menagerie. Some valuable animals, from the artic regions, have 
been lately presented by the Hudson's Bay company : such as Canadian 
lynxes, arctic foxes, porcupines, horned owls, &c. The ornithological 
department comprises several species of eagles, cranes, gulls, gannetts, 
cormorants, with various gallinaceous birds, &c. 

Nearly 1(500 members have already joined the Society. The annual pay- 
ment is two guineas, and the admission fee five guineas ; or the whole may 
be compounded for by a payment of twenty-five pounds. The Society wnll 
probably soon be incorporated, when, as is usual, the terms of admission 
will probably be raised. The gratification which the rich museum of this 
Society in Bruton Street, and their very interesting garden of living animals 
in the Regent's Park, are calculated to afford to persons of leisure and curi- 
osity, is so obvious, that we are surprised the members are not many times 
more numerous than they are. We should have thought that, incfepend- 



Natural Histoi\y in London, 7^ 

ently of all scientific or useful views, the circumstance of a member being 
able to give cards of admission to the museum and garden to his friends, 
would have been sufficient to have rendered this Society one of the most 
popular in the metropolis. We believe, if the Society were better known, 
this would be the case, and we wish to find it so, not only as extending 
innocent and instructive amusement, but as contributing to a science, which 
more than any other demonstrates the existence of design in its subjects. 

In the first prospectus issued by this Society, one of their objects is stated 
to be, " the introduction of new varieties, breeds, and races of animals, for 
the purpose of domestication, or for stocking our farm-yards, woods, plea- 
sure-grounds, and wastes." When this object of the Society comes to be 
better known, we have no doubt it will be most liberally supported by the 
wealthy and the patriotic. 

We anticipate an extraordinary source of interest in the menagerie, 
which we should like to see combined with an arboretum and a col- 
lection of all the plants that will endure our climate, distributed over the 
whole of the Regent's Park, the common trees already planted there being 
cut out, as those belonging to the collection grow up to supply their places. 

The secretary of this society is N. A. Vigors, Esq., one of our first zoolo- 
gists, and editor of the Zoological Journal. 

The MedicO'Botanical Society of London. — This Society was established 
in 1821, for the purpose of especially promoting, by means of experiments 
and lectures, the sciences of medical botany, pharmaceutic chemistry, and 
materia medica. The necessity of such an institution must be very obvious, 
when it is stated, that, previously to its foundation, there was no Society 
for the investigation of the properties of plants, although there were several 
for the encouragement of general botany. It consists of fellows and cor- 
responding members : the former of whom pay an annual subscription of 
two guineas, or a composition of twenty guineas, in lieu of all contri- 
butions ; the latter pay no subscription, but must reside out of England. 

Gentlemen, desirous of becoming fellows, nuist signify their wishes to 
the secretary, who will lay the same before the council, when they will be 
ballotted for at the meeting following that at whioh they shall have been 
proposed. They have the privilege of attending and introducing one per- 
son to the lectures and meetings; and of inspecting the collections of spe- 
cimens, the herbarium, and the library. All new medicines are submitted 
to the Society by its professors, who report their experiments and observa- 
tions thereon. 

The council look forward to be enabled to fit up a reading-room, mu- 
seum, and laboratory, as soon as their funds will enable them to carry into 
effect such a desirable object. The Society meet every month throughout 
the year, except August and September, at the apartments formerly occu- 
pied by the Board of Agriculture, No. 32. Sackville Street, Piccadilly, where 
all communications are requested to be addressed. The Society are endea- 
vouring to collect the medicinal plants of the several colonies, in order 
that gentlemen visiting them in a professional capacity, may inspect the 
same, and become acquainted with their characters previously to their 
departure. To encourage the labours of their men)bers, the Society give 
annually a gold and silver medal for the best communications on medical 
botany. The President is Sir James M'Grigor, M.D. F.R.S. K.T.S., Di- 
rector-General of the Army Medical Board ; John Frost, Esq. F.S.A. 
M.R.I. F.L.S. H.S., is Director, and Professor of Botany ; and Richard 
Morris, Esq. F.L.S., is Secretary. The number of members in all exceeds 
two hundred. 

At a meeting of this Society in October last, 56 lbs. of the seed of ^rge- 
mone mexicana, a mild purgative, were presented by Mr. Higgins, of Nevis; 
and about 30 lbs. of the seed of Genista tinctoria, from the Rev. Mr. Smir- 
novi. The last is a plant usedby the Russians as a cure for hydrophobia.

The'director, Mr. Frost, in his annual oration, commenced by showing 
the advantages derivable from the extended sphere of the Society, and its 
iise to the medical officers of the army and navy. He then pointed out 
the salutary effects that would accrue from the regulations instituted by 
Sir James M'Grigor, Director-General of the Army Medical Board, rela- 
tive to their studying botany. 

A notice was read, offering a reward of 25/., or a gold medal of equal 
value, for an accurate description of the plant jnelding the myrrh, and 
which is merely supposed to be the produce of the ^^'myris Kataf. 

Apt-ill 1. A folio drawing, from Sir A» Johnson, of that curious vegetable 
production, the Pitcher plant, iVep^nthes {ne, negative, penthoSy grief; sup- 
posed effects) distillatoria {fig. 43.), 
from the original drawing) was ex- 
hibited; and a collection of seeds 
presented by Mr. Morris, the secre- 
tary. The Pitcher plant is a native 
of Ceylon, Amboyna, Madagascar, 
and various places in Asia and South 
America. It is so called from the 
pitcher-like termination of the ra- 
dical leaves. These leaves and stalks 
arc highly vascular, and the pitchers 
are so large as to hold two ounces 
or more of clear water each, which 
is distilled into them through the 
stalks. According to Rumphius, the 
water is the habitation of a small 
shrimp ; and, if so, the fact is won- 
derful. A communication was read 
on two species of Melaleuca, and a 
variety of elegant plants exhibited. 
It was announced that on May 9. Mr. Frost, the director, and professor 
of botany, would deliver a lecture on the genus Zaurus and its properties. 

Scientific Institutions. — A new feature in the metropolis is the practice 
of holding evening parties at the principal literary and scientific institutions, 
and at some of these ladies may attend. Various objects of interest are 
displayed throughout the largest apartments, which objects are either 
named or explained by affixed cards, or, if articles manufactured for sale, 
by some one interested in them. Frequently, also, some object or topic is 
explained or discussed scientifically to the surrounding group, and occa- 
sionally a lecture is delivered to the whole company. Tea and coffee, with 
other refreshments, are on a side-table. In the course of the two last 
winters, various meetings of this sort have been held at the Royal, Lon- 
don, and other Institutions, and at the College of Surgeons, which were 
numerously attended, and proved highly gratifying to all parties. 

At the London Institution^ on the evening of April the 16th, the conver- 
saxiqne contained a considerable portion of the mind of the city of London. 
The company began to assemble about 7 o'clock ; and entering the library, 
upwards of fifty different objects in the arts, natural history, antiquities, and 
literary productions or curiosities, placed on tables, or suspended from the 
book-cases, attracted their attention. About 8 o'clock the doors of the 
theatre were thrown open, and, soon after, about 500 persons, perhaps one 
fifteenth of whom were ladies, heard a discourse b^ E. W. Brayley, jun., on 
the circular or quinary arrangement, as existing in the animal kmgdora, 
particularly with respect to birds. Mr. Brayley began by some observ- 
ations on the difference between a natural and an artificial system in 
natural history, stating that, in the latter, some particular character of the 
subjects of classification was selected, to form the basic of an arbitrary 




Natural Histmy in London. 8 1 

arrangement, the design of which was so to assemble them, as to aid the 
memory in the retention of their distinctive characters : but in a natural 
system, or an attempt to describe the mutual relations between natural 
objects as they actually appear to exist in nature, the aggregate of the 
characters, and their variation, ai'e taken as the foundations of the arrange- 
ment. Mr. Brayley then proceeded to a brief view of the history of the 
quinary distribution of animals, and of the circular succession of affinities 
among them. They were discovered, he stated, by Mr. W. S. Macleay, an 
eminent entomologist, at present his Majesty's Commissioner of Arbitration 
at the Havannah, who published, in the year 1819, a work entitled Horce 
Entomol6gicce,'m which he sketched out a view of what appeared to him to 
be the natural arrangement of the animal kingdom in general, and that of 
the sub-kingdom, Annulosa, in particular. A few years subsequently, a 
paper by Mr. Vigors, now secretary of the Zoological Society, was pub- 
lished in the 14th volume of the Transactions of the Linnean Society/, in 
which a similar natural arrangement was demonstrated to pervade the 
feathered creation. This arrangement Mr. Brayley proceeded to explain, 
by means of some large diagrams, and of paintings and specimens of the 
various groups of birds. The first ramification of the class of birds is into 
five orders : Raptores, or birds of prey ; Insessores, or perching birds ; 
Rasores, or gallinaceous birds ; Grallatores, or wading birds ; and Natatores, 
or web-footed birds. Four of these answer respectively to the Linnean 
orders, ^ccipitres, Gallinee, Grallae, and^'nseresjthe Insessores consisting of 
the Picae and Passeres united, as the most eminent naturalists have shown 
they really are, in nature. Intermediate groups of birds connect these 
orders into a complete series returning into itself, or a complete circular 
succession ; and each order consists of five minor groups, also forming a 
circular series, connected together in a corresponding manner, by interme- 
diate or osculant groups. After explaining the characters of the principal 
groups, Mr. Brayley stated, that all the information he had offered respect- 
ing the natural arrangement of birds, had been derived from Mr. Vigors*s 
publications ; and he concluded with a warm tribute to the zeal and disin- 
terestedness displayed by that gentleman in the promotion of zoological 
science, and especially in the concerns of the Zoological Society. 

Mr. Sweet's Aviary, Cameron Square, Chelsea. — Mr. Sweet, having turned 
his attention to taming and keeping the musical genus Sylvia, has, by dili- 
gent observation and appropriate management, actually changed most 
species of this family from annual to perennial songsters. I visited his 
collection in March last, and saw, with surprise, his interesting choristers, 
and heard from them the familiar strains of midsummer. A little room 
with a fire-place serves as an aviary ; in this there are two large cages, 
which contain the nightingale, white-throat, lesser white-throat, pettichaps, 
wheat-ear, whin-chat, stone-chat, redstart, black-cap, willow-wren, and 
some other birds. 

All these beautiful emigrants live healthily and happily together, partake 
of nearly the same kind of food, sing in season and out of season, and, in 
this artificial captivity, even gain new powers of song, and new social pro- 
pensities. Some time back, an old whin- chat adopted for his own, fed, and 
nursed up a nest of young redstarts ; and Mr. Sweet is of opinion, that 
any or all of them may be so treated as to breed in such aviaries. Their 
whole history, treatment, &c., is particularly interesting, and is fully detailed 
in Mr. Sweet's work. The British Warblers, with coloured plates, recently 
published. 

I know not a more interesting amusement than an aviary of such song- 
sters. Their appearance, in a suitably large and warm apartment, gives no 
idea of cruel imprisonment. Paired, as they may be, and ranging among 
living plants, as myrtle and orange trees, in or under which they will build 
and breed, they present no scene of pitiable infringement of liberty, nor of

suffering captivity. On the contrary, to see them on a wintry day, " while 
the storm rises in the blackened east," all comfortably joyous, and safe 
from the chilling blast, gives a sensation of the purest satisfaction to the 
benevolent heart, while their songs of gladness sound like those of grateful 
thanks to their kind protectors. — J. M. April. 

The Ornithological Restdts of Captain Franklin's last Expedition are now 
drawing up by Dr. Richardson, assisted by Mr. Swainson. The work will 
be a very perfect one, and with numerous plates and wood-cuts. The 
drawings o\ the quadrupeds will be done by T. Landseer, and those of the 
birds and vignettes by Mr. Swainson. 

Among the Ornithological Novelties that have recently come from Mexico, 
are skins of the Raniphistus carinatus, or Yellow-breasted Toucan. This 
bird was well known to Edwards, who figured and described it with tole- 
rable accuracy. It seems, however, that from some cause or other, no 
ornithologist since that period had ever seen the species ; and it conse- 
quently remained excluded from all the systems. Not long ago Mr. Swain- 
son accidentally discovered the bill mixed up with other items at an 
auction. By comparing this with Edwards's account, and with a drawing 
in his own possession, this indefatigable zoologist clearly established its cha- 
racters ; and published a figure and description of the species in his third 
volume o^ Zoological Illustrations by the name of Ramphastos carinatus. Yet 
as no other testimony could be brought forward, and no specimen existed in 
Europe, there was reason to believe, until its recent discovery in Mexico, 
that the species, like the Dodo, had become extinct.

Botanical Museum of Cambridge. — The foundation of a Botanical 
Museum and Library was laid by Professor John Martyn, and these- were 
subsequently augmented by Professor Thomas Martyn. For several years 
the Herbarium had been consigned to a damp cupboard, and when it came 
under the care of Professor Henslow, in 1825, was found to have suffered 
considerably. Not half of the specimens were in a sufficiently perfect state 
to be worth retaining. Such as appeared worth preserving have now been 
washed with a solution of corrosive sublimate, and stuck upon paper, to- 
gether with whatever memoranda accompanied each specimen. The library 
consisted of about 300 volumes, chiefly of the earlier writers on botany, 
and may be considered as a useful and valuable depository of such works 
and early editions as still serve to illustrate the progress of this science, 
though now seldom consulted for the purposes of private study. 

The senate having passed a grace during the last year ^1827), for allowing 
an annual stipend for supporting and increasing this museum, there need 
be no apprehensions of any further neglect in this department ; and Pro- 
fessor Henslow therefore ventures to solicit the assistance of his botanical 
friends in procuring materials for supplying the following collections, which 
he has commenced: — 

1. Herbarium of the plants of Cambridgeshfre. 

2. Herbarium of the plants of Great Britain. 

3. Herbarium for a general collection. 

N.B. — All local and rare specimens will be acceptable for the two 
first collections, and any natives, exotics, or cultivated specimens for 
the third. It is requested, where possible, that the exact habitat, 
distinctly written, and the time at which each specimen was ga- 
thered, may accompany it. 

4. Dried lichens, fungi, &c., which have not been submitted to pressure. 

5. Succulent fruits, fungi, &c., in spirits of wine or pickle.

6. Dried fruits, seeds, woods, gums, or any other miscellaneous articles, 
fossil as well as recent, which may tend to illustrate the science. 

Professor Henslow has added the ^Ithae'a hirsuta, from Kent, to the col- 
lection of British plants. Although this species is not mentioned in the 
English Flora, nor figured in the English Botany, it had been previously 
detected and recorded as British in Symmon*s Synopsis, and thence in- 
serted into Turner and Dillwyn's Guide, and Hull's Flora. It grows plen- 
tifully in several cultivated fields about the point of junction of the three 
parishes of Cobham, Cuxton, and Strood, flowering throughout July. — 
J. S. H. Cambridge, April. 

At Cambridge the zeal for Natural History is daily on the increase in the 
university. Professor Henslow holds a natural history party every Friday 
evening at his own house, which is numerously attended by the friends of 
the science. — J. W. Cambridge, March 25. 

Scabiosa arvensis. — Sir J. E. Smith says of this plant, that it is reported 
to be sometimes smooth, with all the leaves undivided, but that this has 
not been seen in England. I found it answering this description, on the 
5th of August, 1825, in the Isle of Wight. — E. K. April, 1827. 

^erraiula tinctoria. — In Sowerby*s Botany it is observed that this plant 
is said to have been seen with white flowers. The English Flora does not 
mention the white variety. In a small wood near Dulwich, in August, 1827, 
I found it in abundance, both with white and with purple flowers. — Id.

Localities (or what botanists call habitats) of rare British Plants. — The 
following plants being not very commonly met with in the neighbourhood 
of London, your readers may be well pleased to know where to find them. 
Ornithogalum umbellatum may be found in plenty on the point of land 
adjoining Teddington Lock, and by the river side in that neighbourhood, 
^nchusa sempervirens may be found in p hedge on the right hand, near to 
Ham House, in going from the river towards Ham Street, ^'ster Tripolium, 
usually found by the sea-coast, I gathered, in 1824, on the banks of the 
Thames, a little above high-water mark, on the way between Richmond and 
Kew. — /rf. 

A root of the Mandrake, ikfandragora officinalis, of the extraordinary 
length of 5 ft. and weighing 1 lbs., was lately dug up, in removing 
the ruins of an ancient edifice at Brighton. As the mandrake is not 
indigenous, and as there has been no garden in the field where it grew 
for many ages, the plant is presumed to have stood there for several 
centuries, probably since the demolishing of monastic buildings by Henry 
VIII., at which time the root of the mandrake was held in high estimation 
by credulous persons. The mandrake is generally believed to be the dudaim 
of the ancient Hebrews, and the plant which was so coveted by Rachel. 
{Brighton Herald.) We think this root much more likely to be that of the 
common white bryony, ^Bryonia alba. — Cond. 

A Woodcock's Nest, with four eggs in it, is now in Chicksand woods,

Werxerian Natural History Society. — Meetings were held on January 
the 12th and 26th, and February the 9th, and some interesting papers 
read; one by Dr. Grant on the anatomy of Perameles nasuta, a rare mar- 
supial animal from New Holland ; a notice of the Cursorius isabellinus, or 
Swift-foot, a rare bird, having been seen in Leicestershire ; and another 
notice respecting the Ouistiti, which the secretary, Mr. Neill, has kindly 
transmitted to us. In some future Number we hope to give a short history 
of this Society. 

Edinburgh Botanic Garden, March, 1828. — Among the rare plants which 
have flowered here during the last three montlis are — Mgmhiia capitata, 
iJubiaceae, a herbaceous climbing plant, from Rio Janeiro ; Artocarpus in- 
tegrifolia, the Entire-leaved Bread-fruit tree, produced several spadices of 
male flowers, but none of female flowers; Dodonae'a attenuata, Jferebirv- 
taceae, a shrub from New South Wales ; Heteropteris fulgens, Malpighi- 
dcetJE, a climbing stove shrub, the native country of which is unknown ; 
Lobelia racemosa, from the West Indies ; Mintha pumila, from Nepal; 
Primula verticillata. {Jam. Jour., April, p. 394.) 

New Localities of rare Plants. — Eriophorum pubescens is found in 
abundance in a boggy field three miles north of Berwick ; Rhodiola rosea 
on Fast Castle, and on rocks near Berwick ; and <Scilla verna plentifully on 
the sea banks at Gun's Green, near Eyemouth. {Javi. Journ., April, p. 404.) 

The Sago Palm. — Cycas (name given by the ancients to a little palm 
which grew in Ethiopia) revoluta is now in flower in the garden of Cally, 
near Gatehouse, Kirkudbrightshire. The same plant flowered in the stove 
at Cally for the first time in June, 1826; it has been at Cally upwards of 
thirty years, and measures in circumference at the tips of the leaves 27 ft. 
The spike, or cone, it produced in 1826 measured 10 ft. in height, and 
appears to have been the male flower — J. N. Cally Gardens, March 14. 

Large Eagle. — A very fine eagle was entrapped last week by Captain 
Ramsay's game-keeper, on the hills above Balnakettle, in Kincardineshire. 
This magnificent bird measures 7 ft. 2 in. between the tips of the wings, and 
weighs lo^lbs. ; that part of his leg commonly called the drumstick, is 
larger than a man can grasp with his hand. He is not at all injured by the 
trap, having been caught by one of the toes, and has been placed in a large 
cage, to keep company with another fine bird of the same species, which 
was taken from the nest in the Clova hills, about four years ago, and is not 
inferior in beauty of plumage, and not much inferior in size. {Edinburgh 
Courant, Feb.) 

A Halibut, 5 ft. 6 in. in breadth, 7 ft. 6 in. in length, and weighing 
320 lbs., was taken, off* the Isle of Man, and brought to Edinburgh fish- 
market on April the 5th, being the largest of that species ever seen there. 
{Scotsman, April 9.^ This fish, the Pleuron^ctes hippogl6ssus JAnn , belongs 
to the same family as the turbot. It inhabits the European and North 
American seas, and is the largest of all aquatic animals except the whale 
tribe, frequently weighing 400 lbs. The body is nmcous, with oblong 
scales sticking firmly to the skin, which is liver-coloured above and white 
beneath. The flesh is fat and coarse, except the part which adheres to the 
side fins.

Belfast Botanic and Horticuttural Garden. — A number of gentlemen of 
Belfast, and its vicinity, have formed a committee for establishing a garden ; 
they have already purchased fourteen acres within a mile of Belfast. The 
objects are, a delightful place of resort; the cultivation of botanical 
science ; a superior style of gardening ; and the improvement of agricul- 
ture. The garden will be the property of holders of shares of five guineas 
ieach. Annual subscribers, of halt a guinea each, shall have free access to 
the garden ; and, with that liberal hospitality characteristic of the country, 
the greatest facility is to be given to the admission of strangers. 

The Belfast Natural Histort/ Societj/, of the origin and progress of which 
we hope soon to give some account, hold their, anniversary, and publish 
a report for the past year, on the 24th of May, the birth-day of Linnaeus. 
An interesting memoir of Mr. Templeton, a well known botanist, was read 
last year by the President, and will be found in our biography in a succeed- 
ing Number. The report, among other things, states that the members of the 
Society are increased to sixty-seven. No very large addition has been made 
to the collection of minerals ; but some exchanges have been effected, and 
others are contemplated, by which the different suites will be rendered more 
complete, and better adapted to illustrate this department of natural science. 
A collection of native birds was commenced towards the close of last ses- 
sion, to which several valuable specimens have been lately added; and it is 
to be expected that still larger additions will soon be made to this interest- 
ing part of the collection. 

Some of the members who direct their attention principally to ento- 
mology have, for some time, been engaged in forming a collection of 
native insects, particularly of those found in the immediate neighbourhood ; 
and preparations are now making for receiving them into the museum. 

Various additions have been made to the Hortus Siccus, and we may soon 
look forward to having a complete collection of the indigenous plants of 
Ireland. An interchange of specimens, too, has been commenced with 
America, by means of which the museum will be enriched with the vege- 
table productions of that extensive continent. 

Some valuable exotics were lately received, which it is the intention of 
the members to present to the Botanical Society; and thus, as should 
always be the case, one scientific institution will lend its aid to the further- 
ance of the plans of another. The connections already formed by the Na- 
tural History Society will empower them occasionally to procure seeds and 
plants from various quarters; and the garden of the Botanical Society will 
enable the Natural History Society to cultivate, to greater advantage, the 
study of one of the most attractive branches of natural history. 

The views of this Society are not confined to the formation of a museum, 
consisting, exclusively, of specimens of botany, mineralogy, or zoology. 
Every thing which can illustrate the history or antiquities of Ireland is 
willingly received; and the object embraces every thing interesting, as con- 
nected with the arts and sciences, or the history of man. Besides some Irish 
antiquities, a few coins have been lately received, which it is hoped will 
form the commencement of an interesting collection in this department. 

During last summer excursions were occasionally made, by individual 
members, to different parts of the adjoining country ; and plants, minerals, 
and insects collected, to illustrate the natural history of the various dis- 
tricts. Extra papers, founded on notes taken on those occasions, have 
been read, and materials are thus gradually accumulating, which may form 
the ground-work of more extensive statistical surveys. A series of meteor- 
ological observations were also made, at the request of the Royal Irish 
Academy.

86 Perennial Calendar of Nature. 

Various donations of books have been received during the present ses- 
sion ; and the library, with very little assistance from the funds of the 
Society, has thus been gradually increased. 

By referring to the analysis book, it appears that twenty-nine papers 
have been read during the present session. Of these, two were on botany, 
eleven on mineralogy, three on topography, besides several local commu- 
nications not noticed among the analyses, and thirteen on the different 
branches of zoology. By comparing this number with that read last ses- 
sion, there appears an increase of five, which can only arise from a greater 
number of extra papers. This is the best proof, if proof were required, of 
the increased interest members now take in the affairs of the Society. 

In looking over the list of donations presented during the last year, we 
are struck by the variety of countries whence they have been received. 
We find the productions of the arctic regions in the next line to those of 
the tropics, the crystals of Iceland beside the minerals of Peru. Science 
seems to have power to annihilate distance, and to make the antipodes hold 
converse with each other; for, besides many specimens of plants, minerals, 
and subjects of zoology, presented from different parts of Ireland and Eng- 
land, donations have been received from Ceylon, Iceland, the Mediterra- 
nean, the West Indies, Mexico, Peru, the Cape of Good Hope, St. 
Michael's, Lapland, and Antigua. 

From all these circumstances, from the gradual but constant progress 
of the Society during the present session, from the increase of its numbers, 
from the additions to its library, and from the enlargement of its museum, 
the curators feel confident of its future utility and advancement. 

The Juvenile Natural History Society of Belfast is, we believe, one of the 
first societies of the kind that has ever been instituted. The general idea 
is excellent, and we hope soon to give such particulars as will lead to the 
formation of similar societies in other large towns. Dr. Drummond, io 
speaking of this Society in his anniversary address, says, " the Juvenile Na- 
tural History Society has wisely received your countenance and assistance; 
and in the young gentlemen who compose it, you naturally look forward to 
future members to supply the places of those of us whose exertions cannot 
be much longer expected." 



Art. VI. Perennial Calendar for various Parts of Europe. 

By a calendar of nature is to be understood a record of the times at 
which certain annual or other changes take place in animals, plants, some 
minerals, and the weather. The uses of such a calendar for any given situ- 
ation, or for different stations throughout a country or division of the globe, 
are various. To the cultivator it indicates more correctly than can be done 
by the artificial measurements of time, the best periods for sowing and 
planting, felling timber, gathering crops, destroying insects, &c. ; to the 
agriculturist it offers various suggestions in regard to the management of 
animals as well as of hay, corn, and other field crops ; to the valetudinarian, 
the tourist, or the retiring citizen in quest of a situation for a country 
residence, it offers a choice of weather and climate; and, to the meteorolo- 
gist, a variety of views and general conclusions, some of which are seen 
or foreseen, and others will be the result of future conclusions from the 
facts which we and others are putting on record. 

After considering the plans of the calendars of nature, which have been 
published by White, Stillingfleet, Aikin, and especially by Dr. Forster, we 
nave arrived at the conclusion, that the way to render such a calendar 
most generally useful, is to confine the indications to a limited number of 
animals and plants, and to let these animals and plants be of the same 
species in all the different stations where the observations are to be made. 
We have made a selection below for every month in the year, and we 



Perennial Calendar of l^aturc. 87 

intend to print it in the form of a letter, and to send copies to a certain 
number of stations in Britain and on the Continent, in order to get the 
blanks filled up, and the letters returned to us at the end of every year. 
We propose that the calendar shall commence from January next, and we 
intend the stations to be as follows : — 

In Erigland and Wales. — * London, Canterbury, Salisbury, Exeter, Ply- 
mouth, * Penzance, Bristol, Swansea, Milford Haven, Holyhead, Chester, 
Carlisle, Berwick, Newcastle, Durham, Hull, Lincoln, Yarmouth, Norwich, 
Ipswich, * Bungay, Cambridge, Oxford, Birmingham, Shrewsbury, Derby, 
York, * Worcester, * Hereford, Broomsgrove, Kendall, and Hexham. 

In Scotland. — * Haddington, * Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness, 
Thurso, * Kirkwall, Ullapool, Stornaway, Benbecula, Rum, Fortwilliam, 
Kilbride, Inverary, Stirling, Dunkeld, * Anaat Gardens near Perth, Fal- 
kirk, Lanark, and Dumfries 

In Ireland. — * Belfast, Londonderry, Enniskillen, Ballinrobe, Galway, 
Limerick, * Cork, Cashel, Wexford, Mullingar, and Dublin. 

On the Continent. — * Paris, Bourdeaux, Marseilles, Nice, Milan, Florence, 
Rome, * Naples, Geneva, Bolwiller, Vienna, Dresden, * Berlin, Hamburgh, 
Brussels, Leyden, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dantzic, * Warsaw, Moscow, 
* Petersburgh, and Stockholm. 

We shall be glad to add other places to this list, as the greater the 
number of points, so much the more useful will be the information. We 
know of individuals who will undertake the calendar at the places 
marked (*), and we should be glad of offers for the remainder or for places 
near them, and for any other places that may be the residences of persons 
friendly to the pursuits of natural history and to this Magazine. We are 
also desirous of receiving such remarks and criticisms as may occur to the 
reader, on the choice of places and plants, so as to profit by them, and 
improve the lists before printing them for distribution. We shall therefore 
not print them for three months to come. We shall send them to their 
destinations in November next ; and, on receiving them in January, 1 830, 
filled up, we shall then present them in a tabular form, and so compressed 
as to occupy only a page or two. In January, 1831, on receiving the lists 
for 1830, we shall arrange them in like manner, and so on yearly. At the 
ends of stated periods of years, say 7, 14, 21, &c., averages will be given, in 
order, as much as possible, to generalise the information obtained. If any 
correspondent can suggest any more useful plan, or any improvement on 
this plan, we shall feel exceedingly obliged to him. 

It may be necessary to premise, that in order to fill up the blanks under 
meteorology, a daily register will require to be kept of the thermometer, 
taken about nine o'clock in the morning ; of the barometer, taken about 
the same time ,- of the rain, taken, every three or four days; and of the 
other particulars daily, after the day has passed.

Art. VII. Calendar of Nature for London, 

The object of this calendar is partly as a record of facts for future use 
and gratification, and partly as a standard of climate, weather, and natural 
appearances, wi^n which naturalists in different parts of the country may 

mpare their own situations. The objects shall not be numerous, and we 
shall in future always commence with those contained in the corresponding 
months of the Perennial Calendar (p. 87.) — Cond. 

A generally mild autumn was succeeded by an equally mild and uncon- 
firmed winter. Several^ of our early song birds, as the thrush, the hedge- 
sparrow, and common wren, were frequently heard before the first of 
Januar)^ Before this day, too, natural primroses appeared" in Covent 
Garden Market. The new year was ushered in by wet yet warm weather ; 
wind generally from S.S.W., and occasionally veering to theW. and N.W., 
at which times the clouds cleared oflfj and night frosts followed. Snow 
fell on the 5th ; on the 11th a heavy fall, with an east wind; also on the 
16th, but which did not lie. 

The equinoctial gales set in on the 18th of March, and continued mo- 
derately till the 25th, when the weather became more settled. The dust 
flew in London streets on the 4th of the same month, when the water- 
carts were in requisition. A blue mist on the 1 5th of March, and several 
misty mornings about the same time. 

In the gardens, early flowers soon showed themselves ; viz., hellebore, 
aconite, groundsel, snowdrops, &c. &c. The almond came in flower on 
the 3d of March, and gooseberries on the 18th. 

First summer birds, the chiff-chaff and black-cap, arrived about the 8th, 
the nightingale, willow-wren, redstart, and lesser field-lark about the 14th. 

The lowest temperature by Fahrenheit was on the morning of the 26th 
of March, when the mercury indicated 25° at 7 A.M. ; the highest point 
was 52°, on the morning of the 12th instant at the same hour. 

On the whole, the season thus far has been a changeable though 
moderate one, and the year promises to be a favourable one for the fruits 
of the earth. — J. M. April 20.

of young observers of nature. — Cond. 

The weather during May and June is usually the most pleasant of the 
whole year ; the air is peculiarly soft and refref bing, being scented with the 



Indicatorial Calendar of Nature.

balmy fragrance of innumerable flowers and opening buds. Almost every 
part of the vegetable creation is in vigorous growth, and holding forth 
the pleasing hope of future perfection. The ear is ever saluted by the con- 
cert of the groves, and all nature seems to rejoice. The wmds are generally 
variable, in which case there are alternations of showers and sunshme j it 
steady from any of the northerly points, with a clear sky, frosty air some- 
times chills the early hours, and checks the tender shoots. Changeable 
weather having continued for the last three months, it is probable it will 
continue four or six weeks longer. 

Quadrupeds. — Moles are affected by the season ; though the constant 
tenants of darkness, their economy in forming their abodes, and exertions 
in search of their food, arrest the notice of the observer. In the beginning 
of May, the female begins to prepare a nest, either under a bush or hedge, 
and not uncommonly in the open pastures, by throwing up a larger hill than 
usual. The water shrew may be seen diving in search of food amongst the 
mud in spring water ditches. 

The Fishes which appear in the London matket in May and June, are 
chiefly the salmon, turbot, mackerel, doree, red mullet, and pike. The 
doree (corrupted from adore'e, worshipped, or probably from doree, gilt ; in 
allusion to its splendid colour) Zeus Faber Lin., ( fig. 44.) is said by some to 
be the fish out of whose 
mouth St. Peter took the 
tribute-money, leaving on its 
sides those incontestible 
proofs of the identity of the 
fish, the marks of his finger 
and thumb. Others contend 
that the fish in question was 
the haddock. It is rather 
hard to determine the dis- 
pute ; for the doree also as- 
serts an origin of its spots 
of a similar nature, but of a 
much later date than the 
former. St. Christopher, in 
wading through an arm of 
the sea, having caught a fish of the kind, en passant, as an eternal me- 
morial of the fact, left the impression on its sides to be transmitted to all 
posterity. In our own country it was very long before the fish attracted 
notice, at least as an edible one. We are indebted to that judicious 
actor and bon vivant, the late Mr. Quin, for adding a most delicious luxury 
to our table, who, overcoming all the vulgar prejudices on account of its 
deformity, has effectually established its reputation. It is found on the 
southern shores of this kingdom. Those of the largest size are taken in the 
Bay of Biscay, and in the Mediterranean. Ovid has called it rams Faber, 
which must have been owing to its excellence, not its scarcity. While living, 
45 ^^ the colour is very resplend- 

ent, and as if gilt, whence, 
according to some, the 
name; butSir Joseph Banks 
used to say it should be 
adoree, and that it was the 
most valuable of fish, be- 
cause it required no sauce. 
The red mullet, or sur- 
mullet, ikfullus Surmuletus 
Lin., {fig. 45.) was highly 
esteemed by the Romans, and bore an cxceedrngiy high price. The ca- 





90 Indicatorial Calendar of Nature. 

pricious epicures of the days of Horace, valued it in proportion to its 
size : not that the larger fish were more delicious, but that they were 
more difficult to be got. Evidence of the high price and the luxury of 
the age, appears from Juvenal : — 

Mullum sex millibus emit. 



^quantem sane paribus sestertia libris.' 

" The lavish slave 

Six thousand pieces for a mullet gave, 
A sesterce for each pound." 

But Apicius, a man of consular dignity, gave a still more unconscionable 
sum, for he did not scruple bestowing 8000 nummi, or 64/. 11*. 8rf., for a 
fish of as small a size as the mullet. (See Pennant.) 

Birds. — Before the middle of May all our summer birds will have ar- 
rived. The turtle-dove and fly-catcher are generally the two last. Through- 
out the two coming months, all the singing birds (those that are constantly 
with us, as well as temporary visitors) may be heard or seen. It is their 
breeding season, after which, several of the emigrants which breed but once, 
leave us. The young of most birds appear ; and the congregBting of those 
of the insectivorous tribes makes it difficult to distinguish the various kinds 
from each other. 

Insects. — Swarms of these will now burst from their egg and chrysalis 
state. The dragon-flies leave the water, the element where they are born 
and bred, and soar in the air, where they may be seen darting after smaller 
winged insects, their prey. The gaudy family of butterflies, the mail-covered 
though splendid tribe of beetles, and the curiously mechanical fraternity of 
bees, every where intrude themselves on the notice of the naturalist. Spi- 
ders weave their geometric-formed webs on every spray ; and which may 
be seen to reflect the prismatic colours, to entice the more readily their 
unwary victims. The common butterfly, Papilio chrysomela alba, depo- 
sits a red fluid; and vast numbers of the insects in the air have dropt 
this fluid in such quantities, as to give rise to the story of a shower of red 
rain, which is given in Gassendi*s Life ofPeirese. (See Brewster* s Journal^ 
April, 1827.) 

Reptiles. — Toads, frogs, and efts may soon be seen changing from their 
tadpole state to their perfect form. Soon after this, the frogs instinctively 
leave the water, and secrete themselves on land, to avoid the notice of their 
natural enemies, ducks, and other aquatic birds. Snakes cast their slough ; 
and, with vipers and slow-worms, may be seen basking under hedges. 

Worms. — The dew-worm may be seen lying abroad, on warm moist 
mornings, or during warm rain. Snails, with their curiously-coloured spiral 
shells, may be seen roving about in moist weather, accompanied by their 
shelless congeners, wherever moisture exists or their favourite food abounds. 
In shallow brooks, in still parts at the edge of the stream, the Gordiu* may 
be seen, like an animated hair, waving its slender body in all directions. 

Plants. — The greatest variety and the brightest glow of Flora's train 
regale the senses in the two ensuing months. In the garden, the conspicu- 
ous paeony, the irises, and ranunculuses are only equalled by the splendid 
flowering shrubs of North America. In the fields, the harebell, stitch- 
wort, and herb-robert may be seen under every hedge ; in meadows, the 
cuckoo-flower, germander-speedwell, scorpion-grass, and above all, that inte- 
resting tribe of plants, the Orchideae, of which several sorts will appear in 
this season. In the marshes may be seen the butterwort, loosestrife, and 
sweet-gale,; and, in rivers, the white and yellow water lilies, water ranun- 
culuses, and many other aquatic plants. 

Astronomical Indications. — Next to the sun and moon, the other planetary 
bodies are the most attractive to the eye; and, as some of your young readers

Death of Sir J. E. Smith, President of the Linnean Society.-^ On Mon- 
day, March 17. at his house in Norwich, aged sixty-eight, died the distin- 
guished naturalist, Sir James Edward Smith, M.D. F.R.S., Member of the 
Academies of Stockholm, Upsal, Turin, Lisbon, Philadelphia, New York, 
&c. &c. ; the Imperial Acad. Naturae Curios., and the Royal Academy of 
Sciences at Paris ; Honorary Member of the Horticultural Society of 
London, and forty years President of the Linnean Society. 

Born at Norwich, Dec. 2. 1759, where he received his education ; went 
to Edinburgh, in 1780, having previously devoted himself to the study of 
natural history, and botany in particular. During his medical studies at 
that university, he so far distinguished himself as a botanist, as to obtain 
the gold medal given to the best proficient among the students in that 
science. 

Upon leaving Edinburgh, and going to London to perfect his professional 
studies, he became acquainted with Sir Joseph Banks, that eminent patron 
of natural science and of all its ardent admirers ; upon whose recommend- 
ation he purchased, in 1784, '* the celebrated Linnean collection" com- 
prising the epistolary correspondence of the great Linneus and his son, 
together with every thing that belonged to those eminent men, relating 
to natural history or medicine. 

From that period, the life of Mr. Smith was devoted to a zealous cul- 
tivation of the science of natural history j and his numerous works will 
constitute a perpetual monument of that fame which no living author 
more duly merited or more justly obtained. 

Having purchased the Linnean collection, and settled in London as an 
acknowledged man of science, in the year 1786 he graduated as a physician 
at Leyden. In that and the following year he visited most of the classical 
and celebrated places of France and Italy. The account of these travels 
was published in 1795, under the title of A Sketch of a Tour on the Conti- 
nent, in 3 vols. 8vo ; a work which at once raised the subject of our me- 
moir into the first class of literary society. 

Upon his return to London, Dr. Smith (in conjunction with his lately 
deceased and highly valued friend, Dr. Goodenough, Lord Bishop of Car- 
lisle, who was one of the original vice-presidents, and Thomas Marshara, 
Esq., who became Treasurer) set about establishing the Linnean Society, 
of which Dr. Smith was the original president, and to which distinguished 
office he was annually and unanimously chosen from that period to the 
present time. 

The first meeting was held April 8. 1788, when " an introductory dis- 
course on the rise and progress of natural history," was read by the Pre- 
sident. This forms the first article of the Transactions of the Linnean 
Society ; a work which has already extended to fourteen or fifteen quarto 
volumes. 



92 Biography : — Si?' James Smith. 

In 1792 Dr. Smith was invited to give some instruction in his favourite 
science of botany to the Queen and Princesses, at their rural and elegant 
retreat at Frogmore, near Windsor ; and how well he was calculated for 
such an appointment, those who have derived delight and improvement 
from his lectures at the Royal Institution, at Liverpool, at Bristol, &c., can 
amply attest. 

In 1796 Dr. Smith was married to the only daughter of the late Robert 
Reeve, Esq., of Lowestoft, Suffolk. 

In the following year he retired from London to reside in his native city ; 
and, with occasional visits to the metropolis, where he had a very numerous 
circle of scientific friends, as well as an extensive acquaintance in the 
highest ranks of society, to whom he was warmly attached, and by whom 
he was reciprocally esteemed, Norwich became his constant residence. 

In 1814 Dr. Smith received the honour of knighthood at the hands of 
His present Majesty, who was then Prince Regent, and who had graciously 
condescended to become Patron of the Linnean Society. 

The Horticultural Society was pleased to enroll the name of Sir James 
Edward Smith as one of its honorary members, in conjunction with those 
of His late Royal Highness the Duke of York and Albany, His Royal 
Highness the Prince Leopold of Saxe Coburg, and Sir Humphrey Davy, 
LL.D. &c., late president of the Ro^^al Society. 

The health of Sir James Edward Smith had been for some time declining ; 
but following the even tenor of his scientific pursuits, and blessed with 
every comfort that a congenial union can afford, his time glided on without 
the slightest relaxation of ardour in his botanical labours, while his latest 
and even his unfinished works, attest that there was no diminution either of 
his zeal or his success, in affording both information and satisfaction to those 
who were proud to look up to him as one of the first botanists of the age. 

In 1824, on occasion of the establishment of a museum of natural his- 
tory in Norwich, through the exertions of a few admirers of the science. 
Sir James Edward Smith kindly lent the weight of his name in furthering 
this object, and condescended to become president of that institution. 

Although none of his friends could be altogether unprepared for the 
melancholy event, still the decease of Sir James Edward Smith was some- 
what sudden. The feebleness of his frame seemed to have in some degree 
recovered a little of its former tone during the last week of his existence, 
so that he was enabled to pursue his accustomed labours, and even to enjoy 
the exercise of taking a walk without any great fatigue. 

He was attacked, however, on Saturoay, March 15., with such an 
alarming degree of debility as almost immediately to extinguish the hopes 
of his recovery. Under this attack he gradually sunk, till, at about six 
o'clock A.M. of Monday, March 17., he placidly resigned his breath, and 
" his spirit returned to him who gave it." 

Among the numerous works of which Sir James Edward Smith was the 
author, it may be sufficient here to mention one or two, perhaps, besides 
his Tour, as those upon which his fame was in a great measure reared, 
and upon which it may be said to be permanently established. 

Of these English Botany is entitled to the first consideration, as con- 
taining a description and a coloured figure of every plant known to be 
indigenous. This work consists of thirty-six octavo volumes, and con- 
tains 2592 figures of British plants. 

It is a curious but a melancholy coincidence, that on the very day he en- 
tered his library for the last time, the packet containing the fourth volume 
of his English Flora reached him ; and he had the gratification of 
witnessing the completion of a work, upon which his friends have fre- 
quently heard him express an opinion that it was the one which would 
eventually redound most to the estimation of his knowledge as a botanist 
and his credit as an author. 



Qiicries and Anders, 93 

A pretty correct estimate of Sir James Edward Smith's benevolent 
views of the power and wisdom of the God of nature, (and he had a most 
perfect and consolatory conviction of the truth of Divine Revelation,) may 
be given with great propriety in his own words, at the conclusion of the 
preface to the work last mentioned : — " He who feeds the sparrows, and 
clothes the golden lily of the fields in a splendour beyond that of Solomon 
himself, invites us, his rational creatures, to confide in his promises of 
eternal life. — The simple blade of grass, and the grain of corn, to which 
he gives its own body, are sufficient to convince us that our trust cannot 
be in vain. Let those who hope to inherit these promises, and those who 
love science for its own sake, cherish the same benevolent dispositions. 
Envy andrivalship, in one case, are no less censurable than bigotry and un- 
charitableness in the other. The former are as incompatible with the love 
of nature as the latter are with the love of God, and they altogether unfit 
us for the enjoyments of happiness here or hereafter." — T»

Putting Bees in Mourning. — I should not have mentioned the following 
circumstance, but I own I feel a curiosity to know if the same superstition 
prevails in any other part of the kingdom. A person, in Norfolk, to 
whom I was talking about bees, told me that where they were kept it was 
peremptory, in case of the death of any of the family, to put the bees in 
mourning, or the consequence would be that all of them would die. He 
followed up this assertion by giving me a case in point, where, from the 
neglect of the custom, every bee in the apiary had perished. The method 
of putting them in mourning is by attaching a piece of black cloth to each 
of the hives ! I — Daniel Stock. Bungay, Suffolk^ April 1. 1828. 

The Shrieke, Lanius (/«wm5, a butcher) excubitor {excubitor, a watcher). — 
Can you or any of your readers inform «.ie if this bird seizes its prey with 
its feet or its bill ? — A.B. 

The following answer to this query we obtained from Mr. Audubon. — 
Cond. 

The Shrieke, Lanius excubitor Lin., when pouncing on its prey, seizes it 
with its bill first (if insectivorous), then secures it under its feet to eat it. 
The same bird, when coming on a bird or a mouse which it has pursued 
for some distance, settles its feet at the moment that it strikes with its bill on 
the cranium of the object pursued. I have seen a bird of this kind, in 
America, carried to a very considerable distance by a Carolina dove, fastened 
to the back and the head of the dove with beak and feet. And although 
the toes are slender, and the claws comparatively weak, their pressure is 
powerful, and the bite it inflicts with the bill can draw blood from a robust 
man's finger in an instant. — J, J. A. 95. Great Russell Street, April 10.

Mya batava. — Are any of your readers possessed of British specimens of 
the true Afya batava of Maton and Turton, (the f/nio batava of Lamarck,)

this shell, which is common in France and other parts of the Continent. 
I purchased a specimen from Mrs. Mawe, which she told me came from 
Gibraltar. — S. C. 

Ground Gruhs. — Sir, I think you would render entomology much 
more useful to people in general than it now is, if you gave us short de- 
scriptions and outline figures of all the ground grubs, which, under various 
names, do so much damage to the farmer and the gardener. The names 
by which they are called are so various, and so contradictory, that I really 
do not know what is the true wu-e-worm. A grub which has long done 
me much damage, and which I thought was the wire-worm, a neighbour

The Eagle and the Hawk. — Sir, In the vignette of your Prospectus 
(otherwise very prettily and correctly designed) you have given a figure, in- 
tended, I presume, for an eagle ; but allow me ^q 
to hint that it has much of'the hawk aspect 
about it, and, in short, that it is a compound 
of both. The bills of all eagles are more or 
less lengthened at the base ; that is, they form 
a straight line towards the nostrils, and then a 
suddenly curve as they approach the end, 
where they bend into a strong hook. {Jig- 
^6.n.\ The bills of hawks (6) and falcons (c), 
on the contrary, are very much shorter, and 
the curve,instead of commencing at about half i 
the length of the bill, begins, as in the figure 
in your vignette, at the very base. These characters and differences in the 
bill mainly serve to distinguish the two divisions of rapacious birds 
placed by Linnaeus in the genus Falco, and known in the days of fal- 
conry by the terms noble and ignoble. The noble falcons are those which 
seize their prey in the air during flight ; for they never devour what 
has been killed or wounded by other birds ; they must drink the blood 
of their victims warm, or not at all. In all these birds the bill i-s very 
short, strong, and much hooked. Cuvier, and other French reformers, 
have made numerous sub-genera of such as vary more or less in the 
shape and form of the bill and wings; but, as I am not acquainted with 
the foreign species, I shall only notice those which occur in Britain. Of 
these noble falcons we have two races : the first, which in point of foct, 
are the most noble^ are such as have the upper mandible of the bill provided 
with a strong and sharp tooth {fig. 46. b\ used, most probably, for the more 
expeditious tearing of their prey; the wings, too, are very long; often, indeed, 
exceeding the tail, and the second feather is always the longest. In both 
these characteristics, swiftness and rapacity are strongly indicated. To 
this tribe belong the restrel or stannel, the merlin, the hobby, and the 
peregrine falcon. The last of these, from its docility and courage, seem& 
to have been the favourite among falconers. The second race of falcons 
are inferior to the first in many respects ; the tooth of their bills is rounded 
off, and does not present an acute angle ; while the wings are proportion- 
ably short, and consequently weaker. Our only native example of these 
birds (which are the true hawks) is the sparrow-hawk Between these two 
races stands the Hiero Falco of Cuvier, known in this country by the name 
of the Iceland falcon. I have never met this bird in any of my shooting 



Retrospective Criticism. 95 

excursions, and shall be very glad if some of your correspondents could 
give me, through your Journal, some intimation of its manners and habits. 
It is described by Cuvier as having the blunt-toothed bill of the hawk, 
and the long wmgs of the true falcons already noticed. It is there- 
fore considered by some as a connecting link between them ; while it is 
placed by Cuvier intermediate between the Nobiles, and the second grand 
division of rapacious birds, called Ignobiles, from their being seldom, if ever, 
used in falconry. Under this title come the buzzards, kites, and eagles. 
All these agree in having the bill provided only with a slight festoon, instead 
of a tooth, and in the fourth feather of the wings being the longest. They 
either dart or fall upon their prey, and do not seize it, like the noble 
birds, by chase ; they may be called, indeed, poachers, while the true fal- 
cons are legitimate hunters. Most of these ignoble birds will devour any 
animal that comes in their way, as rats, mice, snails, slugs, beetles, &c., and 
will, if pressed for food, even devour carrion. Buzzards are known by the 
great length of their wings, their even tail, and their small head and bill. 
Our native species are: — 1. The Hen-harrier; 2. Honey Buzzard; 
3. Common Buzzard; 4. Rough-legged Buzzard; and, 5. Moor Buzzard. 
The kites are not much unlike the buzzards, but have been separated from 
them on account of their long forked tail. One species only is found with 
us, and which is well known. The last tribe of ignoble birds are the eagles. 
It seems strange that naturalists should diiFer so much from poets and his- 
torians, who, in every age, have given the opposite denomination to these 
birds. But this seems to have originated more in ignorance of their habits, 
when compared to the true falcons. Eagles are certainly among the largest 
birds, and eminent for great strength and powers of destruction. They 
may be compared to the race of giants among men, as described in the 
Fairy Tales ; but we seldom read of these giants being at the same time 
brave, generous, or docile. On the contrary, poets describe them as trea- 
cherous, cowardly, and blood-thirsty ; in short, just such a race as the eagles 
are among birds. They may be kept in confinement, and reared from the 
nest, but they are never tamed ; and they will occasionally rob other more 
courageous hunters, of the spoil which they want either the bravery or 
activity to procure for themselves. Wilson, the delightful author of the 
American Ornithology^ describes this trait in the character of the bald 
eagle, in the following glowing colours : — " Elevated on the high dead 
limb of some gigantic tree, he seems calmly to contemplate the motions of 
the feathered tribes below. High over all these, hovers one, whose action 
instantly arrests his attention; by his wide curvature of wing and sudden 
suspension in air, he knows him to be the fish-hawk, settling over some 
devoted victim of the deep. His eye kindles at the sight ; and balancing 
himself with half open wings on the branch, he watches the result. Down, 
rapid as an arrow from heaven, descends the distant object of his attention, 
the roar of its wings reaching the ear as it disappears in the deep. At this 
moment the eager looks of the eagle are all ardour ; and levelling his neck 
for flight, he sees the fish-hawk once more emerge, struggling with his prey, 
and mounting in the air with screams of exultation. These are the signal 
for our hero, who, launching into the air, instantly gives chase, soon gains on 
the fish-hawk ; each exerts his utmost to mount above the other, display- 
ing in these rencontres the most elegant and sublime aerial evolutions. 
The unencumbered eagle rapidly advances, and is just on the point of 
reaching his opponent, when with a sudden scream, probably of despair and 
honest execration, the latter drops his fish. The eagle, poising himself for 
a moment, as if to take a more. certain aim, descends like a whirlwind, 
snatches it in his grasp ere it reaches the water, and bears his ill-gotten 
booty silently away to the woods." In proof, however, of the innate 
cowardice of this formidable robber, the same author adds, — " When 
driven, as he sometimes is, by the combined courage of the fish-hawks,

iTom their neighbourhood, and forced to hunt for himself, he retires more

The above extract is so interesting, that I have transcribed it without 
abridgment, particularly as the great expense of the work will naturally 

Erevent it from being in the hands of many of your readers. Our Natural 
[istory Society here fortunately possess a copy. To conclude, the spe- 
cies of eagles inhabiting Great Britain appear still to be imperfectly under- 
stood. The bald eagle, or white-tailed eagle, above mentioned (Falco leuco- 
c^phalus Lin.\ seems to be the adult of the sea-eagle of Pennant, as the 
ring-tailed is of the golden eagle (F. chrysaetos Lin.). The fishing eagle, 
alluded to by Wilson, is likewise found in Britain. I am. Sir, yours, &c.

Art. I. The Cuvierian, or Natural^ Si/stem of Zoology, 
Essay 1. On the distinctive Characters of Vegetables and Animals, 
and the leading Physiological Characters which serve as the Basis 
for the Four Grand Divisions of the Animal Kingdom. By B. 

X HE excellence of the Cuvierian system of zoology, as ex- 
plained in the work entitled Le Regne Animal, consists in its 
being a natural system, founded on the organisation and the 
essential resemblances of living beings. It presents us with a 
chart of animal life, and shows us that all the varied forms and 
modes under which sentient creatures exist, are referable to 
four distinct forms, or models, and these forms are the found- 
ation of the four grand divisions of the animal kingdom. Each 
of these forms, or models, without changing its essential charac- 
ters, admits of different modifications, corresponding with the 
internal organisation, and thus a natural subdivision into classes 
is established ; and on the same principle is made a farther 
subdivision of each class, into orders, genera, and species. To 
present the reader with a clear but concise view of this system, 
it will be necessary to select and state, in the first instance, the 
leading facts in animal physiology on which the grand divisions 
are founded. 

The ancient division of organised living beings into animate, 
or those which possess feeling and spontaneous motion, and 
inanimate, or those which do not enjoy either of these faculties, 
is, according to Cuvier, sufficiently established ; for, though 
many plants draw back their leaves when touched, and always 
direct them towards the light, and their roots towards mois- 
ture, and though oscillations take place in the parts of some 
vegetables, without any apparent external cause, yet these 
motions bear too slight a resemblance to those of animals, to 
afford proofs of perception or volition. The spontaneous mo-

tions of animals make essential modifications necessary in those 
organs, which may be regarded as simply vegetative. The 
parts which perform the functions of roots do not penetrate 
the ground, they are therefore obliged to have a power resid- 
ing in themselves of gathering their aliments, and they must 
also carry within themselves the receptacle of these aliments. 
Hence arises the first character of animals, — an intestinal 
cavity^ whence the nourishing juices penetrate the other parts, 
either by pores or by vessels, which may be regarded as 
internal roots. The organisation of the intestinal cavity, and 
of its appertenarices, must naturally vary according to the 
nature of the aliments, and the operations they must undergo, 
before furnishing juices proper to be absorbed ; whereas the 
atmosphere and the earth supply vegetables with juices already 
prepared for absorption. The body of an animal, having to 
perform functions more varied and numerous than those of a 
plant, consequently required a much more complicated organ- 
isation ; its parts, also, being unable to preserve a fixed position 
in regard to each other, it was not possible for the regular 
motion of its fluids to be affected by external causes. This 
motion must be independent of temperature and the atmo- 
sphere ; hence the necessity for the seco?id character of animals, 
a system of circulation : but this is less essential than the 
digestive system, because it is not found in the most simple 
animals. 

The functions of animals require organic systems that are 
not necessary in vegetables, — a system of muscles for volun- 
tary motion, and a system of nerves for sensation. The che- 
mical composition of the animal body is also more complicated 
than that of a plant, and there enters into it an additional 
essential elementary substance, azote, which in plants is only 
accidentally united with the three essential elements of their 
organic structure, — oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. The mus^ 
cular and nervous systems, and the dijffh'ent composition of ani- 
mal bodies, form the third character. 

The soil and the atmosphere present to vegetables, for their 
nutrition, water, which is composed of oxygen and hydrogen ; 
and atmospheric air, which contains oxygen, azote, and carbonic 
acid : the latter is a combination of carbon and oxygen. To 
draw from these aliments their proper nourishment, it is neces- 
sary that plants should retain the hydrogen and the carbon, 
and that they should exhale the superfluous oxygen, and ab- 
sorb little or none of the azote : such is the routine (la marche) 
of vegetable life, the essential function of which is the exha- 
lation of oxygen ; this is performed by the aid of light. The 



Ctwiefian System of Zoology, 99 

food of animals, either mediately * or directly, is derived from 
vegetables, in which hydrogen and carbon are the principal 
constituent parts. To reduce them to their proper composition, 
it is necessary that the excess of hydrogen, and more particu- 
larly of carbon, should be diminished, and that the quantity of 
azote should be increased ; this is effected, in respiration, by the 
oxygen of the atmosphere, which combines with the hydrogen 
and carbon of the blood, and is exhaled with them in the state 
of water, or carbonic acid. The azote, from whatever part it 
may enter the animal body, appears to remain there. The 
relations of vegetables and animals with the atmosphere are, 
therefore, the reverse of each other ; vegetables extract and de- 
compose (defont) water and carbonic acid, animals reproduce 
them. Respiration is the function essential to the constitution 
of the animal body ; it is what, in some manner, animates it, 
and we shall see, as we proceed, that the animal functions are 
more or less completely exerted, as the animals enjoy a more 
or less complete respiration; the difference in this respect forms 
ihe fourth character of animals. 

The functions of the animal body are divided into two 
classes : 1st, The animal functions, or those peculiar to animals, 
which are sensibility and voluntary motion ; 2d, The vital or 
vegetative functions, common to animals and vegetables, which 
are nutrition and generation. Sensibility resides in the ner- 
vous system. The most general of the external senses is the 
feeling; it resides in the membrane that covers the whole 
body, called the skin. Many animals are without ears or 
nostrils ; several animals have no eyes ; some are reduced to 
the single sense of feeling; but this sense is possessed by all 
animals. The impressions received by the external senses, are 
propagated by the nerves to the central masses of the nervous 
system, which, in the higher classes of animals, consist of a 
brain and spinal chord. In proportion as animals partake of 
a superior nature, the brain is larger, and sensation is more 
concentrated in this organ ; and in proportion as they are placed 
lower in the scale, the medullary masses are dispersed. In the 
most imperfect genera the nervous substance appears to be 
entirely diffused in the general substance of the body. When 
an animal has received a sensation, and a volition is excited, 
it is by the nerves that this volition is transmitted to the 
muscles. The muscles are bundles [faisceaux) of fleshy fibres, 
whose contractions produce all the motions of the animal body. 
The number and direction of the muscles of every animal are

vegetable kingdom. 

H 2 



100 Cuvierian System of Zoology, 

so disposed, as to perform the motions which it has to execute ; 
and when these motions require great strength, the muscles 
are inserted into hard jointed parts, which may be regarded 
as levers. In vertebrated animals these parts are internal, and 
are formed of gelatine, penetrated by particles of phosphate 
of lime : they are called the bones. In the molluscous and 
crustaceous animals, and in insects, these parts are external, 
and are composed of lime or horny matter (cornee), which 
transudes between the skin and the epidermis : they are called 
shells, crusts, or scales. The fleshy fibres are inserted into 
the hard parts by means of other fibres, of a gelatinous nature, 
which appear to be a continuation of the muscles, and form 
what are called tendons. 

The configuration of the surface of the joints of the bones, 
shells, or crusts of animals limits their motions, which are still 
farther restrained by ligaments attached to the sides of the 
joints. According to the different arrangement of the bony 
and muscular apparatus (appareil), and to the form and pro- 
portion of the members which result from thence, the animals 
are in a condition to perform the innumerable motions which 
take place in walking, leaping, flying, and swimming. 

The muscular fibres concerned in digestion and circulation 
are not subject to the power of volition ; nevertheless, they 
are furnished with nerves, the principal of which undergo sub- 
divisions and enlargements {reriflemens), that appear to be 
intended to withdraw these nerves from the power of volition. 
It is only when under the influence of the passions, or power- 
ful emotions of the mind, that the empire of volition extends 
beyond these barriers, and it is always to disorder the vege- 
tative functions. In a diseased state, likewise, these functions 
are attended with sensation. Most commonly the digestion 
goes on, without being perceived by the animal. 

The aliments, after being divided by the teeth and jaws, or 
sucked in when the animal feeds on liquids, are swallowed by 
the muscular motions of the lower part of the mouth and 
the throat, and are deposited in the first part of the alimentary 
canal, which is commonly swelled out into one or more 
stomachs. There the food is penetrated by juices proper to 
dissolve it. As the food advances along the other parts of the 
alimentary canal, it receives other juices, to complete its pre- 
paration. The internal surface of tlie canal has pores, which 
extract from the alimentary mass the part which is suitable 
for nutrition ; the useless residue is ejected as excrement. 

In the lowest class of animals the intestine is in the form of 
a bag, without a vent, and the excrements are ejected by the 
mouth. The number of animals is more considerable in which

the nourishing juices, absorbed by the coat of the intestines, 
are immediately spread through the whole spongy mass of the 
body {la spongiosite du cor-ps) ; for this appears to be the case 
in the whole class of insects. 

In some of the orders of ^rachnides and of worms, the 
nourishing juices circulate in a system of closed vessels, the 
extreme ramifications of which distribute the molecules to the 
parts that are to be supported by them. The vessels which 
carry this nourishing fluid to the parts are called arteries ; 
those which bring it back to the centre of circulation are 
called veins. The circulation is sometimes simple, and some- 
times double, or even triple, reckoning that of the abdo- 
minal, or biliary, system. The rapidity of the circulation is 
often aided by the contraction of certain fleshy organs (ap- 
pareils), which are called hearts, and are placed at one or 
other of the centres of circulation, and sometimes at both. 

In vertebrated animals, with red blood, the nourishing fluid 
issuing from the intestines is white, and is called chyle ; it is 
carried by particular vessels, called lacteals, into the venous 
system, where it is mixed with the blood. Vessels similar to 
the lacteals, and forming with them a system called the lym- 
phatic, bring back into the venous blood the residue of the 
nutrition, and the products of cutaneous absorption. 

In order that the blood may be rendered suitable for the 
nourishment of the parts, it is necessary that it should receive 
by respiration a certain modification from the ambient element. 

In animals which have a system of circulation, a part of the 
vessels carry the blood into certain organs, where they subdi- 
vide it, and spread it over a great surface, that the action of 
the ambient element may be more powerful. When the ele- 
ment is air, the surface of the organs is cellular [creiise), and 
they are called the lungs ; when the element is water, the sur- 
face of the organs is saliant, and they are called gills. There 
are always organs of motion, disposed in a manner to convey 
the ambient element either into, or upon, the respiratory 
organs. 

In animals which have no circulation the air is spread upon 
all points of the body, by elastic vessels, called tracheae ; or the 
water either penetrates the body through vessels, or only 
bathes the surface of the skin. 

The blood which has undergone the process of respiration, 
is fit to repair the composition of all the parts, and to effect 
what is properly called nutrition. The facility with which the 
blood is decomposed in every point of the body, so as to leave 
there precisely the species of molecules which are requisite for 

H 3

it, is truly marvellous. It is this which constitutes the whole 
vegetative life. 

For the nutrition of solids, we perceive no other arrange- 
ment than a minute subdivision of the last arterial branches ; 
but for the production of liquids, the apparatus is more varied 
and more complicated. Sometimes these last extremities of 
the vessels expand simply over large surfaces, from whence the 
liquid to be produced exhales ; sometimes the liquid exudes 
from the bottom of little cavities ; more frequently the arterial 
extremities, before changing into veins, give rise to particular 
vessels, which carry (transport eiit) this liquid ; and it is at the 
point of union of the two kinds of vessels that it appears to be 
formed. Thus the minute blood-vessels and these peculiar 
(propres) vessels *, by interlacing, form bodies called conglo- 
merate, or secretory, glands. 

In animals which have no circulation the nourishing fluid 
bathes all the parts, each part drawing from the fluid the mole- 
cules necessary for its support ; if it be required that a peculiar 
liquid should be formed, proper vessels float in the nourishing 
fluid, and extract, by their pores, the elements necessary for 
the composition of this liquid. 

Thus the blood constantly maintains the composition of all 
the parts, and repairs the alterations which are the continual 
and necessary consequence of their functions. The general 
ideas that we are able to form of these operations are suffi- 
ciently clear, although we have not distinct notions of what 
takes place in detail in each point ; for want of knowing, wath 
sufficient precision, the chemical composition of each part, we 
cannot give an exact account of the transmutations necessary 
for its production. There are, also, other glands, which sepa- 
rate from the blood certain liquids, that are either ejected as 
superfluous matter, as the urine from the kidneys, or are of 
some service to the animal, as the ink of the cuttle-fish, and 
the purple of some of the Mollusca f , &c. The production of 
a germ, or generation, is an operation, or phenomenon, far more 
difficult to conceive than the secretions ; we may regard it as 
almost incomprehensible ; but when once the existence of the 
germ is admitted, the difficulty is removed. So long as the 
germ adheres to the mother, it is nourished, as if it were one 
of her organs ; when once it is detached, it has itself indivi- 
dual life, which is essentially similar to that of the adult. 

• To these vessels, which Cuvier calls proper, or peculiar, some physio- 
logists have recently given the name of capillary vessels. 

f The cuttle-fish, when pursued, ejects a black liquor, to darken th^ 
water, and hide itself from its enemies. 



CuvietHan System of Zoology, 1 05 

The germ, the embryo, the foetus, the little new-born crea- 
ture, are never perfectly of the same form as the adult, and 
the difference is sometimes so great, that their assimilation 
has obtained the name of a metamorphosis. No person could 
foresee, without previous experience or information, that a 
caterpillar would become a butterfly. 

All living beings are metamorphosed more or less in the 
course of their growth ; that is, they lose certain parts, and 
others are developed which were before inconsiderable. The 
antennae, the wings, and all the parts of the butterfly were 
before enclosed in the skin of the caterpillar ; this skin disap- 
pears, with the jaws, the feet, and other organs which do not 
remain with the butterfly. The feet of the frog are enclosed 
in the skin of the tadpole, and the tadpole, to become a frog, 
loses its tail, its mouth, and its gills. Even the infant, at its 
birth, loses its placenta, and its surrounding membranes ; at a 
certain age it acquires, by degrees, hair, teeth, and a beard ; 
the relative size of the organs change, and its body enlarges 
more in proportion than the head. 

The above selection of the most important facts in animal 
physiology, will serve to indicate the influential characters, 
which ought to serve as the bases for the first divisions of a 
zoological system. It is clear, says Cuvier, that these charac- 
ters should be taken from the functions of sensation and 
motion ; for these not only constitute the being an animal, but 
they establish, in some manner, the degree of its animalisation 
{de S071 animalite). Observation confirms this inference, and 
proves that the degree of developement and of complication of 
the animal functions, is in concordance with that of the 
organs of the vegetative functions. The heart, and the organs of 
circulation, are a species of centre for the vegetative functions, 
as the brain and trunk of the nervous system are for the animal 
functions. We shall see that these two systems diminish (se 
degrader) or disappear together. In animals of the lowest 
class, where there are no visible nerves, there are no distinct 
fibres, and the organs of digestion are simply excavated in the 
homogeneousness of the body. The vascular system disap- 
pears even before the nervous system in insects ; but, in gene- 
ral, the dispersion of the medullary masses corresponds with 
that of the muscular parts. 

The correspondence of the general forms, which result 
fi*om the arrangement of the motive organs, with the distribu- 
tion of the nervous masses, and the energy of the circulating 
system, ought therefore to serve as a basis for the first divi- 
sions (coupures) to be made in the animal kingdom. We 

H 4 



1 04 Cuviei'ian System of toology, 

shall afterwards examine what characters ought immediately 
to succeed them, and form the first subdivisions. 

In considering the animal kingdom according to the prin- 
ciples that have been stated, and setting aside the prejudices 
established by the divisions formerly received, if we regard 
only the organisation and the nature of animals, without 
reference to their size, their utility, or the more or less perfect 
knowledge we have of them, or any other incidental circum- 
stances, we shall find that there are four principal forms, four 
general plans, if I may be allowed the expression, accord- 
ing to which all animals appear to have been modelled ; and all 
the ulterior divisions, by whatever names they may have been 
decorated by naturalists, are only slight modifications, founded 
on the developement or addition of some parts, which do not 
change, in any respect, the essential parts of the plan. 

In the first of these forms, which is that of man and the 
animals that resemble him the most, the brain and the prin- 
cipal trunk of the nervous system are enclosed in a bony enve- 
lope, which forms the skull and the vertebrae ; to the sides of 
this vertebral column are attached the ribs and the bones of 
the members, that form the framework (charpente) of the 
body. The muscles generally cover the bones, which they 
move, and the viscera * {les visceres) are enclosed in the head 
and the trunk of the body. 

Animals of this form we call Vertebrated Animals (/4m- 
mdlia vertebrdta). They have all red blood, a muscular heart, 
and a mouth, with two horizontal jaws ; distinct organs of 
sight, of hearing, of taste, and smell, are placed in the cavi- 
ties of the face. Vertebrated animals have never more than 
four limbs (memhres), the sexes are always separated, they 
have all nearly the same distribution of the medullary masses, 
and of the principal branches of the nervous system. 

In examining closely all the parts of this great division, 
we shall find some analogy even in species the most remote 
from each other, and we can trace the gradations of the same 
plan, in a descending series, from man to the lowest genus of 
^shes. 

In the second form there is no skeleton ; the muscles are 
only attached to the skin, which forms a soft envelope that is 
contractile in every direction. In many species the skin pro- 
duces stony coverings called shells, the position and extent of 
which are analogous to those of the mucous body. The 
viscera and the nervous system are included in the general 

• Viscera, in common language, is applied generally to the intestines ; in 
a scientific acceptation, viscus singidary viscera plural^ may denote any 
internal organ or organs. 



Cuvierian System of Zoology . 105 

envelope. The nervous system is composed of many distinct 
masses, united by nervous threads, the principal of these are 
placed near the oesophagus, and have received the name of 
the brain. In animals of this division we can only distinguish 
the organs of two senses, which are those of taste and sight. 
One single family only exhibits organs of hearing. The sys- 
tem of circulation is, however, complete, and there are parti- 
cular organs for respiration. The organs of digestion and 
secretion are nearly as complicated as those of vertebrated 
animals. 

The animals of this second form are called Molluscous 
Animals (Animdlia molliisca) . Although the plan of their 
organisation, with respect to the external configuration of the 
parts, may not be so uniform as that of vertebrated animals, 
there is always a resemblance between these parts, at least of 
the same degree, in the structure and in the functions. The 
cuttle-fish, and animals with univalve or bivalve shells, belong 
to this division. 

The third form is that which is observed in insects, worms, 
&c. In animals of this division the nervous system consists of 
two long chords, ranging along the belly, and swelling out at 
intervals into ganglions or knots. The first of these knots, 
placed near the oesophagus, is called the brain ; it is but little 
larger than the rest. The envelope of the trunk is divided 
by transverse folds into a certain number of rings, the cover- 
ings of which are sometimes hard, and sometimes soft, but 
the muscles are always attached to them beneath. The trunk 
has often articulated members, or legs, on each side, but is 
frequently without them. The animals of this form we call 
Articulated Animals [Animdlia articuldta). 

In the animals of this division we first observe the pas- 
sage from circulation in a vascular system to nutrition by 
imbibition, apd a corresponding passage from respiration in 
circumscribed organs to that in air-vessels called tracheae, 
which are spread over the whole body. The organs of taste 
and sight are the most distinct in the animals belonging to this 
division ; one single family, only, exhibits organs of hearing. 
The jaws are always lateral. 

The fourth form, which comprises all the animals known 
under the name of zoophytes, may be called Radiated Ani- 
mals [Animdlia radidta). 

In all the preceding divisions the organs of sense and mo- 
tion are placed symmetrically, on the two sides of an axis; 
in the animals of this fourth division they are placed circu- 
larly, round a centre. Many radiated animals approach in 
substance to the homogeneity of plants, they exhibit no dis- 
tinct nervous system, nor organs of the particular senses ; in 



1 06 Tests of a real Mermaid, 

some of them we scarcely perceive any traces of circulation ; 
their organs of respiration are almost always on the surface 
of the body ; in the greater number the whole intestine con- 
sists of a bag without a vent ; and in the lowest families the 
bodies are a kind of homogeneous pulp, possessing a certain 
degree of mobility and sensation. The next essay will contain 
the principal parts of Cuvier's chapter on the intellectual func- 
tions of animals, and some farther observations on organisation, 
before we give his more complete description of the characters 
of vertebrated animals, and their subdivision into four classes.

Sir, 
I VENTURE to address you upon a subject which has 
at various times interested the ingenious, and not a little 
puzzled philosophers themselves ; I mean the tests by which 
a real mermaid may be discovered; if, indeed, there is 
such an animal at all. I am led into these reflections by 
having lately visited one of the principal cities in Holland, in 
the museum of which I was shown one of these wonderful crea- 
tures ; of this, from memory, I have made a slight sketch.

its lungs were excellent ; and that it was not deficient in brains ! 
I asked from whence it came, and was told from Japan ; and 
I could not help replying, after I had spent some time in its 
examination, that, if it had been presented as an artificial 
instead of a natural curiosity, it would have been worthy of 



Tests of a real Met-maid, 107 

admiration, but that, as it was, I conceived it to be an un- 
worthy imposition. My reasons are deduced from the follow- 
ing considerations : — And to speak, first, as to what concerns 
the perfection of its lungs ; fishes, with the small exception 
afforded by the cetaceous class, being, according to the best 
authorities, devoid of hearing, are also denied a voice ; for, in 
creatures who could not converse with each other, this would 
indeed have been an incongruous superfluity. How, then, 
came this singular inhabitant of the great deep to be thus 
wonderfully endowed with organs of which it could never 
make any use? If, too, as it appears from its being so rarely 
seen, its place is at the bottom of the sea, how could a crea- 
ture, with a conformation of the lungs resembling our own, 
live and breathe there, when there is nothing better authenti- 
cated, than that the most expert and practised divers are unable 
to stay at the bottom of the sea more than half an hour ? But 
supposing it, for argument's sake, belonging to the class of 
fishes to which I have adverted, it is a well attested fact, that 
they are not able to remain under the water for more than two 
or three minutes together, before they rise to its surface, in 
order to take in a new inspiration ; and is it possible that this 
animal should be so rarely seen, if this were the case ? Fur- 
ther, every inhabitant of the waters carries on its motions 
through them by means of its fins, as birds do theirs through 
the air by their wings ; and, to be entirely equipped, two pair 
of fins and three single ones appear necessary to the former, 
though one pair of wings is sufficient for all the wants of the 
latter. Of these the pectoral fins, which are placed near the 
gills, act like oars, and serve to impel the animal forward ; 
they likewise keep the head from descending too much into 
the water, or from being too much above it. The ventral 
fins are nearer the tail, and seem chiefly useful in balancing 
the fish in the water; and of the single fins it may be ob- 
served, that the dorsal fin and the anal one, which are on the 
ridge of the back, serve, in some degree, all these purposes, 
while the tail answers to all intents the purpose of a rudder. 
This, as I said before, is the perfect complement of a fish in 
the way of fins ; nevertheless, there are many not, in this 
way, so perfectly endowed, because some peculiarity in their 
conformation, would render so great a number of fins super- 
fluous, if not, indeed, retarding to them. For instance, the 
form of the Murae^na, or eel, being so entirely equal, requires 
little balance either oneway or the other, it is, therefore, entirely 
destitute of ventral fins ; and the Gymnbtus {gymnos, naked, 
notos, back), or Carapo, having the back broad and flat, would 
rather be rendered unsteady if it were in possession of a dorsal

fin. Some fishes, also, have no tail fin. But what shall we say 
to a fish of above three feet in length, which has no fin but 
that ; which has, as one may say, a broad chest and a heavy 
head, without any one contrivance to keep it from being, at 
all times, lower than any other part of its body ? It might, 
indeed, be inferred, that so extraordinary a creature would 
live in an extraordinary manner; and certainly no manner 
could be more extraordinary, than that of living with its head 
downwards, and its tail in the opposite extreme ! But this 
must be impossible under these points of view ; and, I am apt 
to believe, that if all mermaids were tried by one or other, or 
all, of these tests, they would be found equally imaginary. 
Yes, Sir, I cannot help thinking, that in such cases we are not 
less deceived than our ancestors were, though it may be less 
agreeably ; for their mermaids sang, and combed their sunny 
locks, and were, besides, extremely personable monsters, 
while ours are not only altogether mute, but as ugly as can 
be well conceived. If, then, Mr. Editor, we must be in error,

Art. III. Anecdotes of a tamed Panther, By Mrs. Bowdich. 

Sir, 
On perusing the First Number of the Magazine of Natural 
History, I find that you admit zoological anecdotes. I am, 
therefore, induced to send you some account of a panther 
which was in my possession for several months. He and 
another were found when very young in the forest, apparently 
deserted by their mother. They were taken to the king of 
Ashantee, in whose palace they lived several weeks, when my 
hero, being much larger than his companion, suffocated him 
in a fit of romping, and was then sent to Mr. Hutchison, the 
resident left by Mr. Bowdich at Coomassie. This gentleman, 
observing that the animal was very docile, took pains to tame 
him, and in a great measure succeeded. When he was about 
a year old, Mr. Hutchison returned to Cape Coast, and had 
him led through the country by a chain, occasionally letting 
him loose when eating was going forward, when he would sit 
by his master's side, and receive his -share with comparative 
gentleness. Once or twice he purloined a fowl, but easily

gave it up to Mr. Hutchison, on being allowed a portion of 
something else. The day of his arrival he was placed in a 
small court, leading to the private rooms of the governor, and 
after dinner was led by a thin cord into the room, where he 
received our salutations with some degree of roughness, but 
with perfect good-humour. On the least encouragement he 
laid his paws upon our shoulders, rubbed his head upon us, 
and his teeth and claws having been filed, there was no danger 
of tearing our clothes. He was kept in the above court for a 
week or two, and evinced no ferocity, except when one of the 
servants tried to pull his food from him ; he then caught the 
offender by the leg, and tore out a piece of flesh, but he never 
seemed to owe him any ill-will afterwards. He one morning 
broke his cord, and, the cry being given, the castle gates were 
shut, and a chase commenced. After leading his pursuers two 
or three times round the ramparts, and knocking over a few 
children by bouncing against them, he suffered himself to be 
caught, and led quietly back to his quarters, under one of the 
guns of the fortress. 

By degrees the fear of him subsided, and orders having 
been given to the sentinels to prevent his escape through the 
gates, he was left at liberty to go where he pleased, and a boy 
was appointed to prevent him from intruding into the apart- 
ments of the officers. His keeper, however, generally passed 
his watch in sleeping; and Sai', as the panther was called, 
after the royal giver, roamed at large. On one occasion he 
found his servant sitting on the step of the door, upright, but 
fast asleep, when he lifted his paw, gave him a blow on the 
side of the head which laid him flat, and then stood wagging 
his tail, as if enjoying the mischief he had committed. He 
became exceedingly attached to the governor, and followed 
him every-where like a dog. His favourite station was at a 
window of the sitting-room, which overlooked the whole town ; 
there, standing on his hind legs, his fore paws resting on the 
ledge of the window, and his chin laid between them, he ap- 
peared to amuse himself with what was passing beneath. The 
children also stood with him at the window ; and one day, 
finding his presence an incumbrance, and that they could not 
get their chairs close, they used their united efforts to pull 
him down by the tail. He one morning missed the governor, 
who was settling a dispute in the hall, and who, being sur- 
rounded by black people, was hidden from the view of his 
favourite. Sai' wandered with a dejected look to various parts 
of the fortress in search of him ; and, while absent on this 
errand, the audience ceased, the governor returned to his pri- 
vate rooms, and seated himself at a table to write. Presently 



no Anecdotes of a tamed Panther, 

he heard a heavy step coming up the stairs, and, raising his 
eyes to the open door, he beheld Sai'. At that moment he 
gave himself up for lost, for Sai* immediately sprang irom the 
door on to his neck. Instead, however, of devouring him, 
he laid his head close to the governor's, rubbed his cheek 
upon his shoulder, wagged his tail, and tried to evince his 
happiness. Occasionally, however, the panther caused a little 
alarm to the other inmates of the castle, and the poor woman 
who swept the floors, or, to speak technically, the pra-pra 
woman, was made ill by her fright. She was one day sweep- 
ing the boards of the great hall with a short broom, and in an 
attitude nearly approaching to all-fours, and Sai', who was 
hidden under one of the sofas, suddenly leaped upon her 
back, where he stood in triumph. She screamed so violently 
as to summon the other servants, but they, seeing the panther, 
as they thought, in the act of swallowing her, one and all 
scampered off" as quickly as possible; nor was she released 
till the governor, who heard the noise, came to her assistance. 
Strangers were naturally uncomfortable when they saw so 
powerful a beast at perfect liberty, and many were the ridicu- 
lous scenes which took place, they not liking to own their 
alarm, yet perfectly unable to retain their composure in his 
presence. 

This interesting animal was well fed twice every day, but 
never given any thing with life in it. He stood about 2 ft. 
high, and was of a dark yellow colour, thickly spotted wuth 
black rosettes, and from the good feeding and the care taken 
to clean him, hi^s skin shone like silk. The expression of his 
countenance was very animated and good-tempered, and he 
was particularly gentle to children; he would lie down on 
the mats by their side when they slept, and even the infant 
shared his caresses, and remained unhurt. During the period 
of his residence at Cape Coast, I was much occupied by 
making arrangements for my departure from Africa, but gene- 
rally visited my future companion every day, and we in con- 
sequence became great friends before we sailed. He was 
conveyed on board the vessel in a large wooden cage, thickly 
barred in the front with iron. Even this confinement was not 
deemed a sufficient protection by the canoe men * , who were 
so alarmed at taking him from the shore to the vessel, that, in 
their confusion, they dropped cage and all into the sea. For 
a few minutes I gave up my poor panther as lost, but some

sailors jumped into a boat belonging to the vessel, and dragged 
him out in safety. The beast himself seemed completely sub- 
dued by his ducking, and as no one dared to open his cage to 
dry it, he rolled himself up in one corner, nor roused himself 
till after an interval of some days, when he recognised my 
voice. When I first spoke, he raised his head, held it on one 
side, then on the other, to listen ; and wheu I came fully into 
his view, he jumped on his legs, and appeared frantic; he 
rolled himself over and over, he howled, he opened his enor- 
mous jaws and cried, and seemed as if he would have torn his 
cage to pieces. However, as his violence subsided, he con- 
tented himself with thrusting his paws and nose through the 
bars of the cage, to receive my caresses. I suspect that he 
had suffered from sea sickness, as he had apparently loathed 
all food ; but, after this period, he eat every thing that was 
given to him. 

The greatest treat I could bestow upon my favourite was 
lavender water. Mr. Hutchison had told me that, on the way 
from Ashantee, he drew a scented handkerchief from his 
pocket, which was immediately seized on by the panther, who 
reduced it to atoms ; nor could he venture to open a bottle of 
perfume when the animal was near, he was so eager to enjoy 
it. I indulged him twice a week by making a cup of stiff 
paper, pouring a little lavender water into it, and giving it to 
him through the bars of his cage : he would drag it to him 
with great eagerness, roll himself over it, nor rest till the smell 
had evaporated. By this I taught him to put out his paws 
without showing his nails, always refusing the lavender water 
till he had drawn them back again ; and in a short time, he 
never, on any occasion, protruded his claws when offering me 
his paw. 

' We lay eight weeks in the river Gaboon, where he had 
plenty of excellent food, but was never suffered to leave his 
cage, on account of the deck being always filled with black 
strangers, to whom he had a very decided aversion, although 
he was perfectly reconciled to white people. His indignation, 
however, was constantly excited by the pigs, when they were 
suffered to run past his cage ; and the sight of one of the 
monkeys put him in a complete fury. While at anchor in the 
before-mentioned river, an orang-outang (Simla Satyrus) was 
brought for sale, and lived three days on board ; and I shall 
never forget the uncontrollable rage of the one, or the agony of 
the other, at this meeting. The orang was about 3 ft. high, 
and very powerful in proportion to his size; so that when 
he fled with extraordinary rapidity from the panther to the 
further end of the deck, neither men nor things remained

upright when they opposed his progress : there he took refuge 
in a sail, and although generally obedient to the voice of his 
master, force was necessary to make him quit the shelter of its 
folds. As to the panther, his back rose in an arch, his tail 
was elevated and perfectly stiff, his eyes flashed, and, as he 
howled, he showed his huge teeth ; then, as if forgetting the 
bars before him, he tried to spring on the orang, to tear 
him to atoms. It was long before he recovered his tran- 
quillity ; day and night he appeared to be on the listen ; and 
the approach of a large monkey we had on board, or the 
intrusion of a black man, brought a return of his agitation. 

We at length sailed for England, with an ample supply of 
provisions ; but, unhappily, we were boarded by pirates during 
the voyage, and nearly reduced to starvation. My panther 
must have perished had it not been for a collection of more 
than three hundred parrots with which we sailed from the 
river, and which died very fast while we were in the north-west 
trades. Sai's allowance was one per diem, but this was so 
scanty a pittance that he became ravenous, and had not 
patience to pick all the feathers off before he commenced his 
meal. The consequence was that he became very ill, and re- 
fused even this small quantity of food. Those around tried 
to persuade me that he suffered from the colder climate; but 
his dry nose and paws convinced me that he was feverish, and 
I had him taken out of his cage ; when, instead of jumping 
about and enjoying his liberty, he lay down, and rested his 
head upon my feet. I then made him three pills, each con- 
taining two grains of calomel. The boy who had the charge 
of him, and who was much attached to him, held his jaws 
open, and I pushed the medicine down his throat. Early the 
next morning I went to visit my patient, and found his guard 
sleeping in the cage with him; and having administered a fur- 
ther dose to the invalid, I had the satisfaction of seeing him 
perfectly cured by the evening. On the arrival of the vessel 
in the London Docks, Sa'i was taken ashore, and presented to 
the Duchess of York, who placed him in Exeter Change, to 
be taken care of, till she herself went to Oatlands. He re- 
mained there for some weeks, and was suffered to roam about 
the greater part of the day without any restraint. On the 
morning previous to the Duchess's departure from town, she 
went to visit her new pet, played with him, and admired his 
healthy appearance and gentle deportment. In the evening, 
when Her Royal Highness's coachman went to take him away, 
he was dead, in consequence of an inflammation on his lungs.

Art. IV. Some Account of a particular Variety of Bull (Bo*

Sir, 
Agreeably to your request, Mr. Harvey has taken a por- 
trait of this animal ; and, as he has made the drawing on the 
wood himself, the engraving will be a very perfect resem- 
blance, [fg, 48.) I have on my part drawn up the following 
particulars from what my husband told me, and I shall be 
happy if they prove of any interest to you or your readers.

This animal belongs to a Frenchwoman, who says he was 
brought from Afi'ica to Bourdeaux when a calf; and, after 
having been shown in different parts of the Continent, was 
takei\ to London, and exhibited at the Grand Bazaar in King 
Street, Portman Square, last autumn. He is at present five 
years old, 4 ft. high at the shoulder, and 7 ft. in length, from 
the horns to the insertion of the tail. The length of his face 
is 1 ft. 8 in., and the girth round the collar 7 ft. 6 in. His hair 
is short and silky, and the colour a cream or yellowish white, 
except two black tufts which appear on each foot. On the 
back of the neck there is a hump or swelling, which seems 
confined to this variety. The general aspect of the animal is 
mild and docile; but, when irritated, his expression is very 
remarkable, exhibiting itself principally in the eye. This, in 
its ordinary state {fg>^9.\ is very peculiar, rising more than

one half above the orbit, and bearing a resem- 
blance to a cup and ball, thus enabling the ani- 
mal to see on all sides with equal ease. The 49 
iris is naturally of a pale blue colour; but, when 

the animal is irritated, 
it varies from a very 
pale blue or lilac, to 
a deep crimson. Its 
form is also very re- 
markable, being a small oval, or 
rather a parallelogram, with the 
ends cut off, and lying tranversely 
across the ball. [Jig. 50.) The 
black tufts mentioned above are the 
lateral hoofs (fig, 51.), which the animal sheds annually, and 
which grow to the length of five or six inches («). They 
are not shed together, or at 
stated periods; for those of 
the fore feet {a b), in this 

example, are at present of yr — ^ ^ 

different ages, and, conse- 
quently, of different lengths, the difference between them being 
exactly that represented in the sketch. 

On the hump, or collar, the hair grows much longer than on 
the other parts of the body, forming a sort of curled mane, 
resembling, I should imagine, that of the bison. It is perfectly 
white, growing to the length of 1 ft. 6 in., and adding greatly 
to the height of the rising part behind the horns. At present 
the hair is only beginning to grow, but it will be in full beauty 
at the approach of the winter months, and will fall off gra- 
dually again in the early part of the succeeding spring. 

The keeper 
pointed out to 
Mr. Harvey, as 
a remarkable 
peculiarity, that 
the dewlap {Jig, 
52.), in passing 
between the fore legs (a), and under the body {b), seemed to 
divide itself into three parts, which they called the three 
stomachs (I, 2, 3), from their being very much acted on in the 
progress of digestion. I remain, Sir, &c.

It was on a winter's evening, in the month of February, 
1814, that, for the first time in my life, I had an opportunity 
of seeing this rare 
and noble bird, and 
never shall I for- 
get the delight it 
gave me. Not even 
Herschell when he 
discovered the fa- 
mous planet which 
bears his name 
could have experi- 
enced more happy 
feelings. To have 
something new to 
relate, to become 
yourself a contri- 
butor to science, 
must excite the 
proudest emotions 
of the human heart. 

We were on a 
trading voyage, as- 
cending the Upper 
Mississippi, — the 
keen winter blasts 
whistled over our 
heads, and the cold 
from which I suf- 
fered had, in a great 
degree, extinguish- 
ed the deep interest which, at other seasons, this river has 
been wont to awake in me. I lay stretched beside our 
patroon ; the safety of the cargo was forgotten, and the only 
thing that called forth my attention was the multitude of 
ducks, of different species, accompanied by vast flocks of 
swans, which from time to time would pass us. My patroon, 
a Canadian, had been engaged many years in the fur trade ; 
he was a man of much intelligence, who, perceiving that these 
birds had engaged my curiosity, seemed only anxious to find 
some new object to divert me. The sea eagle flew over us. 
** How fortunate !" he exclaimed : " this is what I could have

wished. Look, Sir ! the great eagle, and the only one I have 
seen since I left the lakes." I was instantly on my feet, 
and, having observed it attentively, concluded, as I lost it in 
the distance, that it was a species quite new to me. My 
patroon assured me that such birds were indeed rare; that 
they sometimes followed the hunters, to feed on the entrails of 
the animals they had killed, when the lakes were closed by 
the ice, but, when open, they would dive in the daytime after 
fish, and snatch them up in the manner of the fishing-hawk; 
that they roosted generally on the shelves of the rocks, where 
they built their nests, of which he had discovered several by 
the quantity of white exuviae scattered below. His account will 
be found to accord with the observations which I had after- 
wards an opportunity of making myself. Being convinced 
that the bird was unknown to naturalists, I felt particularly 
anxious to learn its habits, and in what particulars it differed 
from the rest of its genus. Mr. Wilson had confounded it 
with the bald or white-headed eagle, one of the young of 
which he has given the figure of, to represent it. But 1 am 
strongly inclined to believe that he never saw this bird ; for it 
must be acknowledged that he was a very close and accurate 
observer, and, had he met with it, could hardly have fallen 
into so great an error, unless he was deceived by the near 
resemblance which the young of these two species bear to 
each other in plumage, although their difference in size is 
very great : but, in the old birds, the likeness ceases to exist ; 
both in habits and appearance they are totally dissimilar. 
I watched a pair of these birds during a season, and fre- 
quently saw them copulate, as well as the other kind, but on 
no occasion did they mix. 

The sea eagle of America is full one fourth larger in size, 
than any female specimen of the other kind I ever met with, 
old or young. In the United States, from Massachusetts to 
Louisiana on the seaboard, or as high as the mouth of the 
Missouri to the north-west, (I speak only of the extent of 
country I have visited, and where I have seen them,) these 
birds are very rare. This will appear to all, when I say that 
during my many long peregrinations more than eight or nine 
I never found, and only one nest. The sea eagle of Euro- 
pean naturalists, of which Mr. Bewick has given a description, 
and also a figure, in a small wood-cut, is more like the species 
m question, as to form and plumage, than any other. In 
mentioning this gentleman, I cannot forbear expressing the 
high estimation in which I hold his splendid productions ; I 
have no hesitation in pronouncing him a most elegant and 
faithful copier of nature, and the very best illustrator of Eng- 



Bird of Washington. 117 

lish ornithology. Mr. Wilson's figure is not so well done; it 
seems to be taken from a stuffed specimen. 

My next meeting with this bird was a few years afterwards, 
whilst engaged in collecting crayfish, in one of those flats 
which border and divide Green River, in Kentucky, near its 
junction with the Ohio, from the range of high cliffs which, 
for some distance, follow the meanders of that stream. I ob- 
served on the rocks, which, at that place, are nearly perpen- 
dicular, a quantity of white ordure, thinking that owls resorted 
thither. 1 mentioned it to my companions, when one of them, 
who lived within a mile and a half of the place, told me that 
it was from the nest of the brown eagle, meaning the young 
of the white-headed eagle, with which he was acquainted. 
I assured him this could not be ; and remarked that the old, 
as well as young, of that species never built in such places, 
but always in trees. Although he could not answer my ob- 
jection, he stoutly maintained that a brown eagle of some 
kind, above the usual size, had, built there ; he added that 
he had espied the nest some days before, and had seen one 
of the old birds dive and catch a fish. This he thought 
strange, having, till then, always observed that brown and 
bald eagles procured this kind of food by robbing the fish- 
hawks : but, if I felt particularly anxious to know what nest 
it was, I might soon satisfy myself, as the old birds would 
come and feed their young with fish ; he had seen them do so 
before. In high expectation, I seated myself about a hundred 
yards from the foot of the rock. Never did time pass more 
slowly ; I could not help betraying the most impatient curi- 
osity, for my hopes whispered it was a sea eagle's nest. Two 
long hours had elapsed before the old bird made his appear- 
ance, which was announced to us by the loud hissings of the 
two young ones, who crawled to the extremity of the hole to 
receive a fine fish. I had a perfect view of this noble bird as 
he held himself to the edging rock, his tail spread, and his 
wings partly so, and hanging something like the barn bank, 
or social swallow. I trembled lest a word should escape 
from my companions, the slightest murmur had been treason 
from them ; they entered into my feelings, and, although little 
interested, gazed with me. In a few minutes the other parent 
joined her mate, which, from the difference in size (the female 
being much larger), we knew to be the mother bird. She, 
also, had brought a fish ; but, more cautious than her mate, ere 
she alighted, she glanced her quick and piercing eye around,* 
and instantly perceived her procreant bed had been discovered; 
she dropped her prey, with a loud shriek communicated the 
alarm to the male, and, hovering with him over our heads, 

13 



ni Bird of WasJihigton, 

kept up a growling threatening cry, to intimidate us from our 
suspected design. This watchful solicitude I have ever found 
peculiar to the female : must I be understood to speak only of 
birds ? 

The young having hid themselves, we went and picked up 
the fish which the mother had let fall ; it was a white perch, 
weighing about 5\ lbs. ; the upper part of the head was 
broken in, and the back torn by the talons of the eagle. We 
had plainly seen her bearing it, in the manner of the fish-hawk. 

This day's sport being at an end, as we journeyed homewards 
we agreed to return the next morning, being most anxious to 
procure both the old and young birds ; but rainy and tem- 
pestuous weather setting in, our expedition was obliged to be 
postponed till the third day following, when, with guns and 
men all in readiness, we reached the rock. Some posted 
themselves at the foot, others upon it, but in vain. We 
passed the entire day, without either seeing or hearing an 
eagle : the sagacious birds, no doubt, having anticipated an 
invasion, had removed their young to fresh quarters. 

I come at last to the day I had so often and so ardently 
desired. Two years had gone by, since the discovery of the 
nest, in fruitless excursions ; but my wishes were no longer to 
remain ungratified. In returning from the little village of 
Henderson to the house of Doctor R*****, about a mile 
distant, I saw one rise from a small enclosure not a hundred 
yards before me, where the doctor had a few days before 
slaughtered some hogs, and alight upon a low tree branching 
over the road. I prepared my double-barrelled piece, 
which I constantly carry, and went slowly and cautiously 
towards him ; quite fearless he awaited my approach, looking 
upon me with an undaunted eye. 1 fired and he fell; 
before I reached him he was dead. With what delight I 
surveyed this magnificent bird ! Had the finest salmon ever 
pleased him as he did me ? — Never. I ran and presented 
him to my friend, with a pride which those can only feel, 
who, like me, have devoted their earliest childhood to such 
pursuits, and have derived from them their first of plea- 
sures ; to others, I must seem " to prattle out of fasliion." 
The doctor, who was an experienced hunter, examined 
the bird with much satisfaction, and frankly acknowledged 
he had never before seen or heard of it. The name I chose 
for this new species of eagle, " The Bird of Washington," 
may, by some, be considered as preposterous and unfit; 
but, being indisputably the noblest of the genus known to 
naturalists, I trust it will be allowed to retain it. To those, 
however, who may be curious to know my reasons, I can only 



Bird of Washington, 119 

say, that, as the new world gave me birth and liberty, the 
great man who insured its independence is next to my heart : 
he had such true nobility of mind, and honest generous 
feeling, as is seldom possessed ; he w^as brave, so is the 
eagle ; and his name, extending from pole to pole, resembles 
the majestic soarings of the mightiest of the feathered tribe. 
During the month of January following I saw a pair of sea 
eagles flying over the falls of the Ohio, one in chase of the 
other. The next day I saw them again ; the female had re- 
laxed in her severity, had laid aside her coyness, and to a 
favoured tree they continually resorted. I pursued them un- 
successfully for several days, when they forsook the place. 

The flight of this bird is very different from that of the 
white-headed eagle, encircling more diameter than the 
latter ; whilst sailing, keeping nearer to the land and the sur- 
face of the water ; and when about to dive for fish, falling 
in a circuitous spiral manner, as if with an intention of 
checking all retreating movement which its prey might 
attempt, and only when within a few yards darting upon 
it. The fish-hawk often does the same. When rising with 
a fish they fly to a considerable distance, forming, in their 
line of course and that of the water a very acute angle, 
something not exceeding thirty degrees, when several hundred 
yards distant from the spot emerged from. My last oppor- 
tunity of seeing the sea eagle, was on the ] 5th of November, 
1821, a few miles above the mouth of the Ohio ; two passed 
over our boat, moving down in easy flappings. In a letter 
from a kind relation, Mr. * * *, dated, " Falls of the Ohio, 
July, 1819," containing particulars relative to the swallow- 
tailed hawk (Falco furcatus), he also says : " Yesterday, for 
the first time, I had an opportunity of viewing one of those 
magnificent birds, which you call the sea eagle, as it passed 
low over me, whilst fishing ; I shall be really glad when I 
can again have the pleasure of seeing your drawing of it." 
The glands containing the oil used for the purpose of lubri- 
cating the surface of the plumage were, in the specimen here 
represented, extremely large ; the contents had the appear- 
ance of hog's fat which had been melted and become rancid. 
This bird makes more copious use of that substance than 
the white-headed eagle, or any of the Falco genus, except the 
fish-hawk; the whole plumage looking, upon close examin- 
ation, as if it had received a general coating of a thin clear 
dilution of gum arable, and presenting less of the downy gloss 
exhibited on the upper part of the bald-headed eagle's plumage. 
The male bird weighs 14J lbs. avoirdupois, measures 3 ft. 
7 in. in length, and 10 ft. 2 in. in extent. The upper man-

blue; tongue the same; cere greenish yellow; eye large, of a 
fine chestnut colour, iris black, the whole protected above 
by a broad, strong, bony, cartilaginous substance, giving the eye 
the appearance of being much sunk. Lores lightish blue, 
with much strong recumbent hair ; upper part of the head, 
neck, back, scapulars, rump, tail coverts, femorals, and tail 
feathers, dark coppery glossy brown ; throat, front of the 
neck, breast, and belly, rich bright cinnamon colour; the 
feathers of the whole of which are long, narrow, sharp- 
pointed, of a hairy texture, each dashed along the centre 
with the brown of the back ; the wings, when closed, reach 
within an inch and a half of the end of the tail feathers, 
which are very broad next the body. Lesser coverts rusty 
iron grey, forming with that colour an elongated oval, reach- 
ing from the shoulders to the lower end of the secondaries, 
gradually changing to the brown of the back as it meets the 
scapulars. The secondaries of the last middle tint. Primaries 
brown, darkest in their inner veins, very broad and firm ; the 
outer one 2 J in. shorter than the second, the longest 24 in. to 
its root, and about half an inch in diameter at the barrel. The 
under wing coverts iron grey, very broad, and forming the 
same cavity that is apparent in all of this genus with the sca- 
pulars, which also are very broad. Legs and feet strong and 
muscular : the former 1 J in. in diameter; the latter measuring, 
from the base of the hind claw to that of the middle toe, 6Jin. 
Claws strong, much hooked, the hind one 2 in. long, the inner 
rather less, all blue black and glossy. Toes warty, with rasp- 
like advancing hard particles, covered with large scales appear- 
ing again on the front of the leg, all of dirty strong yellow. Leg 
feathers brown cinnamon, pointed backwards. Vomiting powers 
not exhibited, as in owls. The two stomachs large and baggy. 
In the specimens now described, the contents of both, fish and 
fishes* scales, mixed with different entrails. Guts large, but 
transparent and thin of substance. Heart and liver very large, 
the sinews of the first tough and stiff. The sex well ascer- 
tained at the time the bird was killed. 

From the above account it will be seen that the bird here 
described and faithfully figured from a fresh-killed specimen, 
is a very scarce species, even in those parts where it is a 
native ; and, that it is rarely met with, the few opportunities I 
have had of seeing it, the dates of which I have generally 
given, are a sufficient proof.

By A. J. N. 
Birds form the second grand division of the Linnean sys- 
tem of animals, and are characterised by having the body 
covered with feathers. The Linnean orders are six : — 

1. ^ccipitres (accipiter, a hawk; hawk kind, or birds of prey). Bill and 
claws strongly arched {Jig- 54. a). 

2. Picae (pica, a magpie; magpie kind, or peckers). Bill compressed, a 
little curved [b). 

3. ^'nseres {anser, a goose ; of the goose kind). Bill obtuse at the end {c); 
feet webbed {d). 

4. Grallae (graUa, stilts ; stalkers). Legs very long (e). 

5. Gallinae {gal/us, a cock ; pheasant kind). Bill convex, the upper man- 
dible arched (/ ); toes connected by a membrane at the bottom (g) ; tail 
feathers more than twelve (A). 

6. Passeres {passer, a sparrow ; sparrow kind). Bill conic, pointed ; nostrils 
oval, broad, naked (»). 




Pennant arranged birds into two divisions ; viz. Land birds 
and Water birds. These he subdivided into nine orders : of 
these the Land birds formed six; viz. Rapacious, Pies, Gal- 
linaceous, Columbine, Passerine, and Struthious; the Water 
birds three ; viz. Cloven-footed or Waders, Pinnated-footed 
and Web-footed. 

Brisson arranged birds into two grand divisions ; viz. Clo- 
ven-footed and Web-footed. In the first are 17 orders and 85 
genera ; in the second, 9 orders and 28 genera. 

Dr. Latham's arrangement is as follows : — 

First Division. Land birds, Terrestres. — Order 1.' ^cci- 
pitres, or rapacious ; 2. Picae, pies ; 3. i^sseres, passerine ; 
4. Columbae, pigeons; 5. Gallinae, gallinaceous; 6. Stru- 
thi5nes, struthious. 

Second Division. Water birds, Aquaticae. — Order 7. Gral- 
lae, waders; 8. Grallae-pinnatipedes, waders with pinnated 
feet; 9. Palmipedes, web-footed. 



1 22 Introduction to British Ornithology, 

' The number of genera, in the Linnean arrangement, is 78 ; 
and of species, 930. The species described by Dr. Latham 
amount to about 5000. The number of Dr. Latham's genera 
are increased, by his having divided some of the genera of 
Linnaeus into two or more genera. 

Another system has been lately brought into notice by an 
eminent zoologist, N. A. Vigors, Esq., (p. 80.) and which is 
designated the " Quinary System," because it presupposes 
that not only birds, but all other animals, may be divided and 
subdivided mto groups of fives, thus : — 

pRaptores, preyers. 

•o. •, .., . , Insessores, perchers. 

Birds with graspinff claws, are ! t> v , i 

^ . / ^ ° «j Kasores, scratchers. 

I Grail atores, waders ; or 

LNatatores, swimmers. 

The six primary orders of Linnaeus are, by Mr. Vigors, 
converted into five, by uniting the Picse with the Passeres ; 
by which arrangement, the first division of the whole family of 
birds, consisting of Insessores, Raptores, Rasores, Gralla- 
tores, and Natatores, might be considered as classes j the divi- 
sion of each of which into five, might be constituted orders ; 
and the division of each of these again into five groups, might 
constitute the tribes. " So that, if the Raptores should, by 
subsequent discovery, be completed, the classes, according to 
this arrangement, will be 5 ; the orders, 25 ; and the genera, 
125." (Jennings^ s Ornith.) 

Insessores. — 1. Dentirostres (toothed-beaked), 2. Conirostres (conic- 
beaked), 3. Fissirostres (cleft-beaked), 4. Scansores (climbers), 5. Tenue- 
rostres (slender-beaked). 

Raptores. — 1. Falconidae (falcon-like), 2. iStrigidae (owl-like), 5. Tul- 
luridae (vulture-like), 4. ? 5. ? 

Rasores. — 1. Columbidae (pigeon-like), 2. Phasianidae (pheasant-like), 
3. Cracidae (curassow-like), 4. Tetraonidae (bustard-like), 5. ^truthionidae 
(ostrich-like). 

Grallatores. — 1. Cliaradriee (sea-larks), 2. Gruidae (crane-like), 3. Ral- 
lidae (rail-like), 4. ^rdeidae (heron-like), 5. ^colopacidae (woodcock-like). 

Natatores. — 1. Pelicanidae (pelican-like), 2. Z/aridae (sea-gull-like), 
3. A'icadae (awk-like), 4. ^natidae (duck-like), 5. Colyrabidae (dabchick-like). 

Mr. Vigors divides the order Falconidae thus : — 

^quilina (eagle-like), ^ccipitrina (hawk-like), Falconina (falcon-like), 
^teonina (buzzard-like), iVf ilvina (kite-like). 



The Fissir6stres order is divided thus : — il/eropidae (woodpecker-like), 
Jfirundinidae (swallow-like), Caprimulgidae (goatsucker-like), Todidae (tit- 
mouse-like), ifalcyonidae (kingfisner-like). 

It is a curious fact, that by far the greater number of the 
pie and sparrow tribes, in this country, generally lay five eggs ; 
the quinary system is thus corroborated. The student should 
be aware of the censure of St. Pierre : — " Nos ornithologistes 
cnchaines par leur methods, no song^nt qu'a grossir leur cata-

logue, et ne connoissent, dans les oiseaux, que les pattes et le 
bee. Ce n'est point dans les nids qu'ils les observent, mais a 
la chasse et dans leur gibeciere." (Jennings^ s Ornitholbgia,) 

It would be a great point gained, if the ingenious system of 
Mr. Vigors could be established on its professed basis, namely, 
that of nature ; it would simpliiy the science, and render it 
much more easily attained by the student. 

Having given this outline of the principal arrangements 
which have been adopted by naturalists, for the classification of 
birds, I have proposed to myself to begin a series of papers, in 
which it is intended to give particular descriptions and histo- 
rical notices of our principal British birds ; but, before pro- 
ceeding with this, it will be necessary to give a table of the 
terminology used in the descriptions of birds, and to this I 
shall confine myself in the present communication.

three times, and endeavour to apply them to any bird which 
they may have in a cage, or stuffed in the infant museum, 
which, I trust, many of them are now commencing, I shall, 
in my next, commence with Mr. Vigor's class Insess6res, and 
describe the most interesting British species of the pie and

maxim, that the enjoyment procured will be in proportion to 
the labour bestowed.

Art. VII. Considerations on Botany^ as a Study for young 
People, intended as an Introduction to a series of Papers illus- 
trative of the Linncean System of Plants. By Miss Kent, 
Author of Flora Domestica, Sylvan Sketches, &c. 

Sir, 
In this commercial country, where there is so prevalent a 
tendency to judge of every thing by its returns, and where so 
great a stress is laid upon the question of utility, it may 
be necessary to accompany the recommendation of a more 
general study of the works of nature with a few words on this 
head ; and to endeavour to point out some few of the many 
and important uses of natural history, even while I quote 
from your prospectus the fact, that " we are much more 
anxious to recommend the study on the higher principle of 
conducing to elegant recreation and enjoyment, than as leading 



I 



as a Study for young People, 1 25 

merely to profitable pursuits, or utility in the lower sense of 
the word." In a more liberal sense, it may be observed, that 
any thing which affords elegant and innocent recreation, is of 
considerable utility. 

Notwithstanding the unquestionable interest which young 
people generally take in the observation of natural objects, 
natural history has, hitherto, been singularly neglected; I 
mean, as a subject of general enquiry. Many have devoted 
themselves entirely to the study of nature, and such rapid 
strides have been made in every quarter of it, within the last 
century, as to keep the most zealous upon the alert, to follow 
in their various tracks; but, professors excepted, compara- 
tively few persons have turned their attention to a pursuit so 
eminently interesting. Children are frequently observed to 
seize with avidity any little book that treats of the habits of 
animals ; a thirst for further knowledge on the subject is ex- 
cited, but this great advantage is lost. The early years of 
boyhood are generally devoted to the mysteries of grammar ; 
and a child who is detected in reading anecdotes of the faith- 
ful attachment of dogs, of the systematic industry of the 
beaver, &c., is told to put away his " play-books," and learn 
his Latin. Thus discouraged at an early period, without the 
means of gaining further knowledge on the subject to which 
his inclination would lead him, the inclination itself gradually 
dies away, ending, perhaps, in a passion for birdsnesting, or 
the infliction of other torment upon animals ; a habit more 
frequently to be traced to a thoughtless curiosity, and an in- 
terest in their movements, than to any actual desire of giving 
pain. He would see animals in action. Let him watch the 
labours of the bee-hive ; his attention will be fixed, his in- 
terest excited, and he will have no wish to disturb the indus- 
trious colony that affords him so much amusement. Let him 
examine the busy activity of the ant-hill, and still he will be 
satisfied with the objects before him. The habits of birds 
being less open to observation, he seeks them in the nest ; 
first, from curiosity; though, afterwards, it is probable that 
his vanity will be called into play, by the desire of multiplying 
the trophies of his address and agility ; and he will string 
together the baffled hopes of many a feathered pair, proudly 
triumphing in their numbers, but without one thought of the 
bereaved mothers and their disappointed mates. If he diverts 
himself with catching flies, it is still in the same spirit of cu- 
riosity : they fly from place to place, he cannot trace each 
individual, or, in anyway, understand its economy; he would 
know what it would do under certain circumstances ; he 
catches one in his hand, it flutters to escape ; he contrives to 



126 Considerations on Botany , 

imprison it under a glass, and watches, with interest, its en- 
deavours to regain liberty ; he deprives it of its wings, still 
to see how, in such situations, the little insect will conduct 
itself. Let boys be encouraged in the pursuit of a species of 
knowledge so agreeable to them as the habits of animals ; let 
them be supplied with books, and assisted in any little diffi- 
culties that occur to them, and a great majority will, of their 
own accord, devote to it even the leisure so precious to them; 
nor will it be too bold to say, that boys thus accustomed to 
think of the feelings and instincts of a variety of living crea- 
tures, will never shock humanity by the cruelty of thoughtless 
sports. 

Girls are not only discouraged from the pursuit of natural 
history, but are very commonly forbidden it. Confounding 
innocence with ignorance, their instructors keep from them all 
books that may afford information which they would consider 
as objectionable, or excite enquiry which they would think it 
injudicious to satisfy. When arrived at an age to judge for 
themselves, young ladies are apt to be alarmed by the nume- 
rous terms of science; unacquainted with Latin, they shrink 
from this formidable difficulty, and either decide that, how- 
ever sweet be the kernel, the shell is too hard for them to 
crack ; or, if less diffident of their powers or sparing of their 
trouble, they are willing to surmount that obstacle, they are 
met by another, the dread of being branded with that fearful 
epithet — blue ! The latter difficulty is, however, easily ob- 
viated; since the lady is not compelled to obtrude upon 
others the Latin terms which serve as stepping-stones to the 
knowledge of which she is in pursuit. I do not assert that 
natural history is the study the most peculiarly adapted to 
enable a young lady to shine in company ; but neither that 
ligr any other is surely any hindrance ta it. The more we 
know on any one subject, the more we are prepared to throw 
amusement and illustration on any other. 

To some branches of natural history it has been objected 
that their study leads to no useful result. This is applied 
more particularly to mineralogy, conchology, botany, &c. 
To speak of the latter only, which, perhaps, has been the 
most generally charged with iimtility, I fear not to assert 
that the charge is unfounded. I have heard some indivi- 
duals go so far as to question the utility of the knowledge of 
plants altogether ; this extravagance can scarcely be very ge- 
neral ; a moment's consideration of the many, the innumer- 
able uses to which plants have been applied by mankind, and 
of the facility which a due knowledge of their structure and 



as a Study fo7' young People, 1^7 

situation affords, in judging of their properties, will suffice to 
set aside this most unreflecting mistake. Is it nothing that a 
man, surrounded by plants wholly new to him, should be 
able, in a moment, to determine with which he might relieve 
his hunger with impunity ? Is it nothing to know, that, how- 
ever a fruit may tempt his thirsty lip, it were death to imbibe 
one particle of its juice ? Was it nothing that Linnaeus, by 
his knowledge of plants, at once put a stop to a mortality 
among the cattle in Lapland ? — But enough ; let us turn to 
the more fi-equent objection of the uselessness of botany, as a 
general study or accomplishment. We readily learn to un- 
dervalue knowledge we do not possess ; forgetting that we are 
no better qualified to form an opinion on the subject, than to 
judge of a book we have not read. It is a common mistake 
with those who are totally unacquainted with botany, that it 
consists of nothing but poring over flowers with a magnifying 
glass, counting their stamens and pistils, &c. and then turning 
over half a dozen volumes of technical description; all for the 
purpose of ascertaining the 7iames of the plants examined. 
Thus they take one branch for the whole body of the science, 
and at once decide against it as a tiresome and useless en- 
quiry. It was once observed to me by a youth of very supe- 
rior abilities and attainments, that, to him, botany appeared 
to be an endless solving of riddles. The simile, as far as 
regards one particular branch of the science, is not a bad one: 
but, since these riddles are only to be solved by the most 
attentive observation, comparison, and enquiry; since from 
these exercises of the mind results an acquaintance with many 
admirable productions of nature, which excite many of our 
best and most pleasurable feelings ; these riddles are not to be 
disregarded, but rather to be encouraged, as a means of im- 
proving and refining the mind and the heart. 

No one branch of knowledge can be fully appreciated by 
those who do not actually possess it. We can neither judge 
of the difficulties nor attractions of any study that we have not 
ourselves attempted ; and it is only in proportion with our 
progress that we can estimate the object in view. Let us re- 
member these truisms, and be cautious in pronouncing upon 
subjects of which we are wholly ignorant. Zoology is, per- 
haps, the branch of natural history the most generally inter- 
esting ;. but botany has one great advantage, in offering more 
opportunity for practical illustration. To females, in parti- 
cular, it offers this advantage. A lady may read zoological 
works; may be highly interested in the endless variety of 
animals, and the peculiar economy of each; quadrupeds, birds, 



12S Considerations on Botany^ 

insects, &c., oflfer a never ending topic of enquiry and interest ; 
but she can have little opportunity of observing for herself, of 
applying the knowledge she obtains, of " solving riddles." 
For her knowledge of living creatures, she must be indebted 
chiefly to books and prints ; she will scarcely bring home in 
her delicate fingers a young hedge-hog, a hornet, or a bat, 
to compare with her books, and to ascertain their genus or 
their species ; she will not dissect a monkey or a bear to study 
their anatomy. The habits of animals are interesting ; she 
reads, and takes all for granted : but, in the study of plants, 
her interest is kept continually on the alert, by the practical 
application of the knowledge she acquires. We do not sit 
down to read Linnaeus's Genera Plantdrum^ Withering's Bo- 
tany^ or Smith's English Flbra^ as we would Bingley's Animal 
Biography^ Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, Bewick, Buffon, &c. : 
but we walk out, and day after day we see beautiful flowers 
springing up in the sunshine — we would know what they are; 
we see a lovely blossom, from which a butterfly as lovely 
is extracting the honey — we would be acquainted with both; 
but the butterfly disappears, we could not take it captive, 
without alarming it, injuring its beauty, and giving it pain ; 
the flower we may appropriate, may examine at our leisure ; 
with a few books, and a very little assistance (or, if our love 
of flowers be very great, with our books only), we may soon 
learn to discover the genus of flowers, and, ere long, to distin^ 
guish their species. In examining their construction with a 
microscope, how many beauties do we find that had previously 
been lost upon us ! The beauty of flowers does not lie wholly 
in their vivid colours and bright contrasts : observe the starry 
capsule of the corn-poppy, when its fragile petals have been 
carried away by the winds ; see the blue corn-flower (com- 
monly called blue-bottle), — what a beautiful coronet of sky- 
blue florets ! every floret a fairy vase, in the depth of which 
nature prepares sweet nectar for the butterfly and the bee ! 
But when these have disappeared, there is beauty also in the 
winged children they have left, rocking each in its green cra- 
dle. In some of the species, these winged offspring are 
peculiarly beautifiil ; they seem like fairies' shuttlecocks, ele- 
gantly variegated at the base, and set with the most delicate 
feathers of a jet black ; so delicate are these feathers, that to 
the unassisted eye they show like hairs. Then examine how 
the pistil is affixed to its centre ; how one minute groove is 
fitted to another with a nicety of mechanism, so finished, so 
beautiful ! What human hand could form one seed like this? — 
this little seed, which, in its minute and exquisite perfection, 



as a Study for young People, 1 29 

is scattered abroad by thousands, unnoticed and unseen ! 
See the long feathery seed-vessels of the willow-herb ; exa- 
mine with what completeness is formed each separate floret of 
the many that compose the daisy. The daisy, which people 
call a flower, — a flower? every daisy is in itself a bouquet; 
a bunch of differing flowers, white and yellow ! Lay under 
the microscope the flower of the forget-me-not; the silken 
stamens of the black mullein ; the tiny blossoms of the knot- 
grass ; the leaves of the mountain St. John's-wort, and of the 
perforated St. John's-wort, — its petals, too, edged on one side 
with purple beads. Look but at the receptacle of the com- 
mon dandelion ; thus magnified, it exhibits beauty well worth 
the seeking. 

It is a notion with many, and one that I the better under- 
stand from having once partaken of it, that the study of 
botany detracts from our pleasure in the beauty of flowers. 
There is in flowers something of a poetic character, pleasur- 
able and imaginative, which we fear to destroy by associations 
so mechanical as classes, orders, genera, petals, stamens, &c. 
The fear is groundless : we should rather look upon these 
systematic niceties as a foreign grammar, which opens new 
stores of poetry hitherto unintelligible to us. The mystery 
that lies in the heart and first cause of every thing, still 
remains the same, let us know as much as we can. 

One great drawback to the study of botany has been the 
practice of writing botanical works altogether in the Latin 
tongue; but this is rather an ideal than a real obstacle; 
since, though such works are necessarily closed to those who 
do not understand that language, there are many English 
works on the subject ; quite sufficient to enable an English- 
man to become a very good botanist. For a long period, in- 
deed, science was carefully secured from the consideration of 
females by its locks of Latin ; and, though the absurd preju- 
dices against female education have, in a great measure, 
yielded to the progress of the times, yet that language, not 
being generally studied by ladies, still has power to scare 
them from an attempt, of which it leads them to overrate the 
difficulties ; and the sex is considerably indebted to some 
naturalists of the present day, who have, as far as possible, 
anglicised the terms of science, and simplified the subjects 
of which they have treated. 

Let any one who is fond of flowers make the experiment ; 
it may be made at very little expense ; any of the English 
Introductions to Botany^ Smith's English Flbra^ and a botani- 
cal microscope, will suffice for the commencement. I should 
Vol. L — No. 2. k 



1 30 Cmisidet^ations on Botany, 

add, perhaps, a little tin case * , in which to bring home 
and to preserve the plants, until they can be examined at 
leisure. Oh, what delight does the young botanist experience, 
when he first ascertains a plant by his own observation of its 
natural characters ! With what interest is every new flower 
added to his store of knowledge ! and when more advanced, 
and the common plants of the neighbourhood have become 
familiar, how welcome is the sight of a plant that he does not 
know ! What ecstasy, if it be a rare one ! What consciousness 
of wealth in adding to the daily increasing herbarium ! I 
speak of the herbarium as a thing of course : for every young 
botanist, whose love of flowers is genuine, will be earnest to 
preserve specimens of the plants he examines ; to serve, at 
once, as trophies and memorials. 

I am the more zealous in my desire to extend a taste 
for this delightful science, from my confidence in its favour- 
able tendencies. I look upon botany as a study calculated 
to improve both the mind and the body : it accustoms us to 
arrange our ideas ; fixes our attention upon objects the most 
worthy of contemplation, and the best fitted to excite our 
admiration and gratitude ; gives an inexpressible charm to 
our rural walks ; and, while it lures us abroad, and tempts 
us to take a greater portion of exercise, it gives us health as 
well as occupation and amusement. " The study of English 
botany," says Dr. Aikin, " caused several summers to glide 
away with me, in more pure and active delight, than almost 
any other single object ever afforded me. It rendered every 
"walk and ride interesting, and converted the plodding rounds 
of business into excursions of pleasure." f 

Most persons extend their affections, more or less, beyond 
their own species : men love horses and dogs ; some have 
taken delight in pet bears or tigers ; ladies keep rabbits, 
squirrels, silkworms, birds, &c. None of these playthings 
affords so much amusement as flowers, with equal innocence. 
It may seem very startling to question the innocence of such 
pursuits ; but what would be our opinions on the subject, 
could we, for a moment, fancy ourselves in the place of any 
one of these imprisoned favountes ? Is it by choice that the 
giddy squirrel has forsaken the trees in which he used to 
frolic ? Does he prefer the confinement of his cage ; or, is

he content to exchange his liberty for the pleasure of being 
gazed upon, when he cracks the nuts we may occasionally 
choose to bestow upon him ? Is the lark that soars higher 
than the clouds, as he welcomes the morning with his 
sprightly song, well pleased to be imprisoned in that gloomy 
cage, with just space enough allowed him to hop off and on 
that handful of turf? Is the nightingale, who derives his 
birth from a land of roses, happy in being shut up in a 
wooden box, one half of which admits no light, during our 
cold and foggy winter; happy in being debarred from that 
annual flight to which nature urges him, in being doomed to 
solitary imprisonment, at a time when he should be cheering 
his patient mate with his song ? No, no, — let us not blind 
our minds to the evident truth, that whatever pleasure we 
may derive from these little victims, is obtained at their cost; 
such pleasure is not innocent. 

Botany has this advantage over some other branches of 
natural history, that it offers no temptation to cruelty. I 
cannot but believe that the many cruel experiments which 
divers naturalists have made upon various living creatures, 
have had a good end in view ; and that those who have made 
them, have thought themselves authorised so to do, and 
believed that the end sanctioned the means. This is a great 
question, and one I will not attempt to discuss ; I leave it 
to those whom it most concerns, to settle as they best can : it 
does not concern the general student. But there are lesser 
sins to which the inconsiderate might be tempted, in the zeal 
of enquiry ; and we fear that the study of birds, insects, &c., 
are not a little likely to offer such temptations. In the vege- 
table world we have all the interest of continual change, pro* 
gress, reproduction, life, and death, without the fear of in- 
flicting pain; we may ourselves cause the existence of the 
most beautiful plants ; we put a seed into the earth, and when 
we see the young leaves shoot forth, they seem almost as of 
our own creation ; we rear them, observe their progress, and 
watch over their health with an interest and pleasure unem- 
bittered by such thoughts, as, to a thinking mind, take all 
sweetness from the melody of the captive bird. As mere 
amusement, the study of flowers is a perfectly innocent one : 
we may be satisfied with it as such ; or we may derive from it 
a more intellectual enjoyment, by turning our attention to 
that higher branch of the science, which treats of the interior 
organisation of plants ; the functions of their various parts ; 
how acting and how acted upon ; their produce and their 
properties, from the little chaffweed (Centunculus minimus)

to the majestic banyan tree (i^icus indica), which is in itself 
a grove, a little forest; and of which Bishop Heber men- 
tions one much celebrated, which occupies the whole of an 
island of the Nerbudda; and, in its best days, afforded 
shelter for 10,000 horse. Although said to have i3een planted 
by a saint, a great part of it, together with the ground on 
which it stood, has been destroyed by the sea. " But," says 
the bishop, " there is still enough left to make it one of the 
noblest groves in the world." This very singular tree might 
be considered as an emblem of maternal and filial love, the 
mother and her offspring continually affording to each other 
mutual support. 

The study of the vegetable world has something of that 
soothing power which we experience from its actual presence. 
There is, undoubtedly, an influence in the pure air, the still- 
ness, the calm freshness of the country', that tends to quell 
all unkindly feelings, and to foster the gentler affections. I 
can scarcely believe it possible that any bosom could harbour 
malice or revenge, amid flowers and trees, woods and green 
fields. Such scenes are favourable to reflection ; and dis- 
passionate reflection will turn anger into pity, and lend to 
sorrow itself a patience from which it may extract some por- 
tion of sweetness. Something of that refreshment which we 
experience, when, for a time, we escape the bustle and con- 
tention of a town life, and take refuge in the tranquillity of 
the country, we may derive from the mental contemplation of 
the beauties of nature. How inexpressibly refreshing to the 
mind is the view, of the calm operations of nature, in the 
vegetable world, after perusing a volume of history ! How 
delightful to turn from war, treachery, murder, violence, and 
evil passions of all kinds, to the calm wisdom and beneficent 
power displayed in the production of the humblest weed ! 
We may fancy plants capable of a sense of tranquillity ; they 
possess just that degree of animation that we may suppose to 
enjoy the tranquillity they inspire ; somewhat like that of a 
slumbering child. 

There are many reasons in favour of commencing the study 
of botany with our native plants, and those in a wild state. 
Plants are liable to many changes from cultivation, that would 
puzzle a novice ; and it were well that the student should 
become acquainted with the freaks of nature, before he 
attempts to follow those of art. The genuine lover of flowers 
will not, however, confine himself to indigenous botany. All the 
plants that come in his way, or to which he can obtain access, 
he will desire to be acquainted with ; and there are, in the en- 



a^ a Study for young People. 133 

virons of London, some admirable collections, that will afford 
him a fund of information and delight, in the study of exotics. 
There I leave him; bashfulness, I presume, will not impede 
his progress. Not so our female students ; I must venture 
to say a word in their behalf, to the proprietors of these 
imported gardens. Gentlemen are, perhaps, less liable to 
the disappointment of which I am about to speak ; I can 
readily suppose that there are comparatively few male visitors 
who are not more or less acquainted with botany, and, there- 
fore, they would be likely to fare better than ladies, of whom 
the great majority go merely as to an exhibition of beautiful 
plants, without knowing one from another, or caring to know 
them, unless, it may be, the coffee tree, and one or two others 
of popular note. The consequence is, that those ladies who 
go with a view to further enquiry are liable to disappoint- 
ment. A lady derives little information, and, therefore, 
comparatively little pleasure, from a visit to the best col- 
lection of exotics, however rare, however beautiful, however 
interesting, from the hasty manner in which she is conducted 
through them. She is not only led hastily onwards, without 
time to pay one hundredth part of the attention they deserve, 
to the plants exhibited, but is generally attended by some ig- 
norant lad, who is incompetent to reply to any question put 
to him, as to the plants, their names, countries, habits, &c. ; 
and though she may see a variety of interesting plants, all un- 
known to her, she will be very fortunate if she learn even the 
name of one or two of them. Might not this objection be 
obviated, by labelling the plants with their botanical names, 
and permitting the visitor to examine them alone, and at 
leisure ; or attended only by a boy, whom a sixpence might 
compensate for his trouble, however long detained? The 
most interesting exotics would thus become familiar both to 
the mind and to the eye. It is not to be expected, but that 
the time of a person well qualified to give the desired in- 
formation to the botanical visitor of an exotic collection, 
should be too precious to be lingered away in such 
attendance ; but were the plants labelled, and the visitor 
allowed sufficient leisure, all persons might derive pleasure 
and knowledge, in proportion as they should be qualified to 
seek it. 

I remember more than once to have experienced the evils 
of which I speak. On some occasions, after asking several 
questions of the youth who attended our party, and finding 
that he could not answer them ; that even the answers he 
did give were not correct ; I desisted altogether from seeking 

K 3 



134 Botany^ as a Study for young People. 

the knowledge which I went purposely to obtain, and re- 
turned but little wiser. On one occasion our party was ac- 
companied by an able and experienced botanist ; but there 
were older persons than ourselves, and gentlemen, in com- 
pany, who, of course, engrossed the whole of his time and 
attention ; and those who were the best qualified to under- 
stand, and the most interested in obtaining, the information 
he might communicate, were precisely those who learned 
nothing from the visit but what their own eyes could teach 
them. Even supposing the botanist to have been at liberty 
to attend to ourselves only, diffidence would have restrained 
us from putting to him a twentieth part of the questions we 
should have desired to ask ; and even then, we should have 
preferred a more leisurely examination of the pknts. It is 
from my own early experience, and earnest wishes, that I 
am led to judge of the regrets and wishes of others, and 
humbly to suggest the remedy. 

I propose to give, in this Magazine, a series of botanical 
papers, illustrative of the Linnaean system ; in which I 
shall endeavour to avoid alarming the young student with a 
crowd of technicalities, at the very outset, unaccompanied by 
any thing to bribe his attention to them. I will so 
disperse the husks, that they may not all lie at the top ; but 
may, at least, allow the observer to perceive that there is 
grain beneath ; and that for every slight layer of them re- 
moved, he may obtain a portion of it. The study of botany 
is much easier than appears to those who have not attempted 
it. Before the time of Linnaeus, indeed, it was a kind of 
chaos ; the confusion arising from the contradictions of dif- 
ferent writers was endless. With no one acknowledged 
system, every botanist followed his own mode of arrangement; 
and it was with much difficulty that they made themselves in- 
telligible to each other. Linnasus appeared; and not only 
did he arrange the whole vegetable world systematically, and 
according to a system, the intrinsic excellence of which, 
overcoming national jealousy, and the self-love of individuals, 
obtained its adoption over all Europe; but, by the invention 
of trivial names, gave a precision to his arrangement which 
rendered it doubly valuable. Until the middle of the last 
century, when trivial names were first introduced, the several 
species were distinguished by long Latin phrases, which, in 
addition to their inconvenience, were an endless source of 
confusion and doubt. It was as though. Christian names 
being unknown, we were to distinguish a family of sisters by 
personal description ; and instead of designating one as Miss 



The Jussieuean, or Natural, System of Plants, 135 

Lucy Smith, and another as Miss Mary Smith, we should 
say : " Yesterday I met Miss Smith, with black eyes and 
chestnut hair, who is rather tall, stoops a little in the 
shoulders, has a pretty little foot, and speaks with a lisp; and 
I asked her how the Miss Smith was, with blue eyes, auburn 
hair, pale cheeks, and a majestic air, and with a mc>le on her 
chin." Nothing, as Rousseau observes, could be more 
pedantic or ridiculous, than for a person, when asked the 
name of a flower, to be obliged to " answer with a long file 
of Latin words, that have the appearance of a magical in- 
cantation ;" an inconvenience, continues he, sufficient to deter 
many persons "from a charming study, offered with so 
pedantic an apparatus." 

These difficulties being removed by Linnaeus ; and, as I 
have observed, some late writers having introduced a more 
simple language than was formerly used, the study of botany 
has been rendered as easy as it is pleasing; and, in gratitude 
to Linnaeus and his successors, we should avail ourselves of 
the advantages they have procured us. 

While writing the above, I received the fourth volume of 
Sir J. E. Smith's English JFlbra, which comes, accompanied 
by the intelligence that its author is no more ; as though he 
had lived but to complete that valuable work. By the con- 
clusion, it appears, that ill health has so long delayed the 
publication of this volume. I have looked for it with im- 
patience, and cannot refrain from availing myself of this 
opportunity of acknowledging my gratitude to one to whom 
botany and botanists are so deeply indebted ; and whose last 
work has been to me, for some years past, a delightful com- 
panion, and an instructive friend. 



Art. VIII. The Jussieuean, or Natural, System of Plants, 
{Continued from p. 37.) 

Having given a general view of the two grand physiological 
divisions of plants, Cellulares and Vasculares, we shall next 
present a short tabular view of their systematic subdivisions, 
and afterwards arrange all the genera of the plants indigenous or 
introduced into Britain, under the different classes, subclasses 
or orders, and tribes, into which they are thrown by the natural 
system. The following is a general view of the leading divi- 
sions, with their characters : —

This subdivision comprehends all the Dicotyledonous plants, 
that have both a calyx and corolla, by which they are dis- 
tinguished from Monochlamj'deae, in which the calyx only 
exists. It is in consequence of this high developement of the 
floral envelopes, that the greater part of flowering trees and 
shrubs are found in Dichlamydeae; it rarely happening that 
those with a single floral covering only have any brilliant 
colouring.

Petals insei'ted into the receptacle. 
The insertion of the petals and stamens into the receptacle 
is the great character of this subclass, which, therefore, con- 
tains all the polyandrous plants of Linnaeus, as the Calyciflorse 
contain the icosandrous genera of the same botanist.

OhdebI. i2ANUNCULA^CEiE. 

The greater part of the plants of this order are objects of in- 
terest with gardeners, containing, as it does, many of the most 
elegant or showy of the tribes of hardy plants. It is here that 
the graceful clematis, the lowly anemone, the glittering ranuncu- 
lus, and the gaudy pa^ony are found ; differing, indeed, in exter- 
nal appearance, but combined by all the essential characters of 
the fructification. It is remarkable, however, that the acrid and 
venomous properties of these plants are nearly as powerful as 
their beauty is great. They are all caustic, and in many of 
them the deleterious principle is in most dangerous abundance. 
M. DecandoUe remarks that its nature is extremely singular ; 
it is so volatile, that, in most cases, simple drying in the air or 
infusion in water is sufficient to destroy it: it is neither acid 
nor alkaline; but its activity is increased by acids, honey, 
sugar, wine, or alcohol ; and it is, in reality, destructible only 
by water. The crowfoots of our European pastures, and the 
Anemone trilobata and triternata of those of South America, 
are well known poisons of cattle. Blistering plasters are made 
in Iceland of the leaves of ^Ranunculus acris. The foliage of 
some species of Clematis is supposed to afford the means em- 
ployed by beggars of producing artificial ulcers. Some of the 
aconites are .diuretic, especially Napellus and Cammarum. 
Z)e]phinium Consolida is said to be an ingredient in those 
French cosmetics which are so destructive of the surface of 
the skin. The //elleborus, famous in classical history for its 
drastic powers, and the Nigella, celebrated in ancient house- 
wifery for its aromatic seeds, which were used for pepper be- 
fore that article was discovered, are both comprehended in 
i?anunculaceae. The range of this order, in a geographical 
point of view, is very extensive. A great number has been 
discovered in Europe, but they are so abundant in all parts of 
the world that an order can scarcely be found more universally 
and equally dispersed. It is singular, that, with the exception 
of the climbing species of Clematis and of Xanthorhiza, 



138 The Jussieuea)i, or Natural, System of Plants. 

scarcely an instance occurs in 7?anunculaceae of a shrubby 
stem.

Order II. DILLENU^C^^. 

Fine plants, almost exclusively confined to tropical coun- 
tries. Dillen/a speciosa, a native of India, is a most noble 
tree with large yellow flowers, rivalling those of a Magnoh'a. 
Hibbert/ff volubilis is a green-house plant, well known for the 
beauty of its blossoms, and their powerfully fetid smell. The 
medical properties of this order are scarcely known; a decoc- 
tion of their leaves or bark is astringent, and used for gargles ; 
and the acid juice of the fruit of some of the species of Dillenia 
is used in India, mixed with water, as a pleasant beverage 
in fevers. The foliage of many of the species is extremely 
scabrous, whence the dried leaves are much used for the same 
purposes as fish-skin and sand-paper in Europe; those of 
Trachytella aspera are even employed in China for polishing 
works of metal.

Order III. MkGNOLIA'CEJE. 
No one is ignorant of the grandeur of Magnolias, or of the 
delicious, though sometimes dangerous, fragrance of their 
blossoms ; but it is less generally known, that from their affi- 
nity to the trees that produce the famous Winter's bark, and 
Melambro bark, they possess medicinal qualities of no com- 
mon power. The bark of all of them is said to have a bitter 
flavour without any astringency, and combined with a hot aro- 
matic principle. In the United States, the bark of Magnolm 



The Jussieiiean, or Natural^ Si/stem of Plants, 139 

glauca and Lirioderidron tulipihvo. is employed for the same 
purposes as Jesuit's bark, and from the fruit of Magnolm acu- 
minata, a tincture is prepared which has some reputation for 
removing attacks of rheumatism. The fruit of Illicium fl'nisa- 
tum is the material which flavours the liqueur called Anisette 
de Bourdeaux. The Magnolias are exclusively inhabitants of 
Asia and America, no species having hitherto been found 
either in Europe or in Africa. 

Illicium L. Liriodendron W, 

Magnolia L. Michelfa L. 

Obder IV. ANONA'CEM. 
The plants of this order are closely allied to Magnoh'«V<^, 
from which they are principally distinguished by the absence 
of stipulae, and by the structure of their anthers and seeds. The 
latter consist of a hard mass of albumen, ruminated, as the bo- 
tanists call it, that is to say, perforated by the substance of the 
seed-coat, in every direction. They are all trees or shrubs, and 
chiefly inhabitants of the hottest parts of the tropics, but a few 
have been discovered straggling into the temperate zones of 
America. The fruit of the Aiibna is in many species highly 
esteemed as an article for the dessert, especially that of the 
CheiHmoyo^ which has the reputation of being the finest fruit 
in the world, next to the mangosteen. The hard fruits of the 
species of Uvaria are highly aromatic ; those of one of them 
furnish the Piper aethiopicum of the shops. The genus 
Asimina is the only one which contains any hardy species, and 
these are so delicate as to be seen very rarely in this country. 
In Brazil, the bark of Xylopia sericea is used for cordage ; 
for which it is admirably adapted.

Order V. MENISPEOlMEiE. 
The order of Menispermeae consists entirely of twining shrubs 
with very minute flowers. They are extremely dissimilar in 
habit from the orders which are placed near them, and occupy 
their present station entirely on account of certain minute but 
important characters in their fructification. With the exception 
of Schizandra coccinea none of them are w^orth cultivating as 
plants of ornament. The berries of Lctrdizahdla biternata are 
sold in the markets of Chile, under the name of Aguilboquil, 
Guilbogui, or Cogtiill-Vochi, according to diflerent travellers. 
The bitter diuretic, and aperient sorts of Pareira brava, are 
produced by a species of Menispermum, as is also the famous 
Calumba root, so much esteemed for its intense bitterness, and 
for its use in diarrhoea and dysentery. The poisonous drug, 



1 4-0 The Jussieueaiiy or 'Natural^ System of Plants. 

called Cocculus indicus in the shops, is the seed of Menisper- 
mum Cocculus. Several Brazilian species of Cocculus are 
said to possess powerful febrifugal properties. No species of 
Menispermeae is found in Europe ; they are chiefly natives of 
tropical America and Asia.

Order VI. BERBERFDEJE. 

With the exception of Berhei'is this o.der does not contain 
any genus of much interest ; most of the others are low, incon- 
spicuous, herbaceous plants ; Nandhia is an elegant Japanese 
shrub. The Berberises are all shrubs of much beauty and 
interest, especially the species with pinnated leaves, which are 
sometimes called Mahonias. These are all inhabitants either 
of Europe, Asia, or North and South America ; none have 
ever been seen in Africa or New South Wales. Many of the 
finest species from Chile and India yet remain to be intro- 
duced. The berries of the Berberises are acid and astringent ; 
the latter quality is especially abundant in the stem and bark.

Order VII. PODOPHYLL.VCEiE. 

Little interesting herbaceous North American plants, nearly 
related on the one hand to A^ymphaeaceae, and, on the other, 
to the herbaceous genera of JBerberides, Their juice is held 
to be purgative. 

Podophyllum L. JeflPersdnia Ph. 

Order VIII. HYDROPELTFDE^. 

This order differs from ^ympha^aceae chiefly in having a de- 
finite number of seeds. It consists of only two genera, each 
containing a single species. Both are little floating plants of 
tropical and northern America. Nothing is known of their 

properties. 

Hydrop^ltis L. 

Order IX. inMPHMkVEM. 
Like the last, these are all floating plants, and, to gardeners, 
possessed of great interest, on account of the elegant form and 
various hues of their flowers. Two species are known as the 
lilies of our own streams and ponds, and the remainder occupy 
similar stations in other countries. Some of the Indian 
species of iVymphse^a are delightfully fragrant. The holy 
cyamus, or Pythagorean bean of anti(juity, is the produce of 
the Nelumhium^ a stately aquatic, which abounds in all the hot- 



The Jiissieuean^ or Natural^ System of Plants, 141 

ter countries of the East, where its roots are frequently used 
as an article of food. The ditches about Pekin and other 
Chinese cities, are literally choked up with its abundance. 
The pericarpia, or beans, are oblong, hard, smooth bodies, and 
possess the power of vegetating after having been dried for 
even thirty years. The flowers and roots of the common 
white xVymphae^a have been long celebrated for their sedative 
and antiaphrodisiacal qualities, which are, however, now con- 
sidered doubtful. In Sweden, in years of scarcity, the roots 
of A^uphar lutea are pounded into cakes, along with the inner 
bark of Pinus sylvestris. 

This order has been the cause of much difference among 
botanists, as to its true station in a natural classification, its 
structure being of so doubtful a character as to leave room for 
disputing whether it belongs to Dicotyledones or Monocotyle- 
dones. Upon this subject M. DecandoUe has the following 
remarks : " Gaertner declares that the embryo is undivided, 
and therefore monocotyledonous. In 1802, 1 remarked in the 
Bulletin Philomaihique, that the embryos both of A^ymphae^a 
and A^uphar are enclosed in a peculiar integument, and that a 
dicotyledonous structure is apparent when that integument is 
removed; shortly after, M. Mirbel declared that the embryo 
of Nelumbium has two thick cotyledons ; in 1 806, M. Turpin 
gave an accurate description of the kmi o^ Neh'imbiumXviteum, 
w^ithout however removing the doubts about the real structure 
of the embryo; and two years afterwards his colleague, M. 
Poiteau, described the seed and germination of the same plant, 
pointing out that the embryo consisted of two thick cotyledons 
enclosed within a stipular membrane, but destitute of radicula : 
this was subsequently confirmed by M. Mirbel after very minute 
anatomical examination; that observer compared the seed of 
Nelumbium to the seed of ^mygdalus, and also to that of Piper 
and Saururus, and also demonstrated that the structure of the 
stem was analogous to that of exogenous or dicotyledonous 
plants. A very different opinion was shortly afterwards held 
by M. Correa de Serni, an observer of the highest order, who 
admitted indeed that ATymphaeaceae are exogenous, but con- 
tended that the parts which had been taken by previous ob- 
servers for cotyledons were, in fact, a mere expansion of the 
radicle, and that cotyledons were as entirely absent in Nelum- 
bium as in Cuscuta. In the meanwhile M. de Jussieu adhered 
to the old opinion, that A^ymphaeaceae are monocotyledonous ; 
in which he was supported by the late Professor Louis Claude 
Richard, a name for ever memorable in the annals of Carpology 
(karpos, a fruit, logos, a discourse), who published a new view 
of their structure, in which he differed materially from all his 



142 The Jussietiean^ or Natural, System of Plants, 

predecessors ; this botanist considered the stipulary membrane 
of Poiteau a simple cotyledon, and the cotyledons of that 
writer the hypoblastus {hypo, under, hlastos, bud), or body of 
the radicula ; he also refused to admit any evidence derived 
from the anatomical structure of the stem. In this conflict of 
opinions, we have determined to station ^ymphaeaceae among 
Exogenes, for the following reasons : 1st, because the struc- 
ture of their stem is that of Exogenes rather than of Endogenes ; 
2dly, because the two opposite bodies, enclosed within the little 
bag or stipulary membrane described by Poiteau, appear to be 
undoubtedly cotyledons, which is confirmed by the presence of a 
plumula between them in Neluvihium ; Sd\y, because of the 
structure of their flower, which has a great affinity with that of 
Pa^bnia, Magnolia, and Papaver ; 4thly, on account of the simi- 
larity between their fruit and stigma and that of Papaver ; 5thly, 
because of their milky juice and convolute leaves, two charac- 
ters which are not known to exist among Endogenes." Those 
who are interested in pursuing this curious discussion any far- 
ther, will find many remarks and illustrative figures in the .

These plants are better known for their medicinal properties

consisting of curious little American marsh plants of difficult 
culture, and remarkable for the singular pitcher-like form of 
its leaves. The peculiar power of the poppy is, as is well

although in a less intense degree in all but the officinal Papa-

obtained. The Mexicans use the expressed oil of the seeds

Order XII. CRUCFFERJE. 
The importance of this order to mankind, and the singular 
nature of its botanical characters, render it expedient to speak 
very fully upon it; in which the remarks of the learned M. 
Decandolle, who has paid Cruciferae particular attention, will 
be chiefly followed. The order consists wholly of annual or 
perennial, often biennial, herbs, occasionally assuming a suf- 
frutescent habit ; then, however, never exceeding the height of 
three feet. The roots are either thick and perennial, or an- 
nual or biennial and slender, almost always perpendicular and 
undivided. The young roots are tipped with a little sheath, 
called the coleorhiza {koleos, a sheath, rliiza, a root), which is 
produced by the extended ruptured coat of the epidermis, 
when the rootlet first appears. This is a curious character, 
and deserves attention. The stems are round or somewhat 
angular, bi'anched, and often, even in the annual species, in- 
durated at the base. The branches proceed from the axillae 
of the leaves, but the uppermost ones are abortive in most 
cases. The racemes are always opposite to the leaves ; some- 
times the terminal branch is abortive when the raceme 
appears to be terminal; but this is merely owing to that cir- 
cumstance. The leaves are simple, generally radical or alter- 
nate, rarely opposite. The flowers are either white, yellow, 
or purple, or, in a few Cape species, bright blue. The fruit is 
called either a siliqua or silicula ; the former being a linear pod 
containing many seeds, the latter a roundish pod containing 
one or very few seeds, whence this order, which is the same 
as the Linnean class Tetradynamia, is divided by Linnaeus into 
two parts, called Siliquosae and Siliculosae. In the seed, the 
radicle and cotyledons are applied to each other in different 
ways, from which the suborders of M. Decandolle derive their 
characters. When the edge of the cotyledons is pressed close 
to the radicula, so that a cross section would be thus o =, the 



144 Footsteps in the Saiidstone 

cotyledons are said to be accumbent, as in all Pleurorhizeae 
{pleiiro?i, the side, rhiza, a root) ; when the side of the cotyle- 
dons is pressed to the radicula, thus oil, the former are called 
incumbent, as in Notorhizeae {notos, the back, rhiza, a root). 
If the cotyledons are incumbent, and at the same time half 
folded together or conduplicate, thus o > > , the suborder 
Orthoploceae (orthos, upright, ploke, a fold) is formed ; when 
the cotyledons are incumbent and spirally twisted, so that a 
section would resemble this o || ||, they constitute the sub- 
order Spirolobeae [speh'a, a spire, lobos^ a pod) ; and finally, 
when the cotyledons are incumbent, and doubled twice in their 
length, thus o II || [|j we have Diplolobae {diploos, double,

Art. IX. A short Notice of the Occurrence of Footsteps in the 
Sandstone of Corn Cockle Muir, in Dumfriesshire. By K.N. 

In a quarry, situated in the New Red Sandstone district o* 
Dumfriesshire, about three miles north of Lochmaben, the 
workmen, in the course of excavating stones, have for some 
time discovered marks which correspond exactly in appear- 
ance with the footsteps of some four-footed animal. The rock 
has been long quarried for building materials, as well as for 
paving stones, (for each it is well adapted, owing to its lami- 
nated structure,) and the existence of the foot-marks has been 
known for fifteen or sixteen years, though little notice was 
taken of them, until they attracted the attention of Dr. Dun- 
can, minister of Ruthwell, who has been most assiduous in 
investigating the fact, and in making it public. The strata 
dip to the south-east, under an angle of about 37 or 38 degrees. 

It is particularly worthy of notice, that the marks are not 
confined to one part of the bed ; on the contrary, they are 
found on almost each succeeding layer, and are met with at 
the spot where the quarry-men are now working, which is 
more than 40 ft. below ground The laminated structure of 
the bed, which is easily divisible into layers of various thick- 
nesses, from the breadth of an inch to that of several feet, 
demonstrates that the sandstone was not all deposited at one 
time; as, in that case, it would most probably have formed 
one solid compact mass. It is on the upper surface of these 
layers that the footsteps exist ; and each succeeding lamina, 
on its deposition, appears to have filled up the indentation 
beneath, like plaster of Paris poured into a mould. On

separating two layers, were it not for the friable nature of the 
sandstone, which causes it to break and remain in the matrix, 
as it were, the lower surface of an upper layer would exhibit 
an exact cast of the indentation beneath. As it is, the sub- 
stance of the sandstone thus remaining in adheres so slightly 
to the cavity, that it is generally easy to scrape it out, without 
at all injuring the shape of the foot-mark. This fact will de- 
cidedly prove that the marks do not proceed from any fossil 
contained in the sandstone (an idea which might probably 
occur to a person who had not seen any specimens) ; as, in 
that case, an indentation would be left both in the upper 
and under laminas, which is not the case. 
' The strongest proof that the marks were caused by animals 
is their arrangement in two parallel lines, and at regular dis- 
tances from each other, and the agreement in shape and 
position of the alternate marks, by which the hind foot is 
easily distinguishable from the fore. One specimen, a slab 
about 8 ft. long, which was taken out of the quarry some years 
ago, contains no less than twenty-four footsteps, in which the 
most perfect order is preserved ; so that, were it not for the 
hardness of the stone, it would not be difficult to believe that 
an animal had just passed over it. 

In this specimen the mark of the hind foot comes up to, 
and in some places partly effaces that of the fore. In the 
quarry the footsteps are found ranging in distinct and regular 
tracks. Their direction is up and down the strata ; in no 
instance do they extend across. They are not all of the 
same size or shape. In one set the toes in the front of the 
foot have left a very distinct impression, while the heel has 
displaced and turned up the sand hehind at each successive 
step. In another variety the toes are scarcely discernible, and 
the heel seems to have slid some way from the spot where it 
was first put down, gradually sinking until the animal acquired 
a firm footing. The difference of these two sets of marks has 
been accounted for by supposing them to have been caused, 
the former in the ascent, the latter in the descent, of the ani- 
mal. If that were the case, we must suppose that the sand- 
stone existed in its present inclined position while yet in a soft 
state ; a fact quite at variance with the theories at present 
current among geologists. 

The cause of this difference may perhaps be explained by 
supposing that they are the foot-marks of distinct species of 
animals. As they are never found intermixed, but always in 
separate tracks, and as, in the latter of the two varieties 
enumerated, the length of the steps is greater than in the 

Vol. I. — No. 2. l 



146 Crystallisation of Gold. 

former, in proportion to the size of the foot, this supposition is 
not without foundation. 

Professor Buckland has given the credit of the foot-marks 
to an animal of the genus Testiido. A comparison has been 
ingeniously instituted by that gentleman between the foot- 
steps in the stone and those made by recent tortoises. For 
this purpose he has caused live animals of that genus to walk 
over soft clay or dough, and the result tends decidedly to con- 
firm his opinion; and here it may not be out of place to notice 
some observations made by a writer in a late number of the 
London Magazine * upon this subject. It is there remarked, 
" They (the Geological Society) had much better have re- 
frained ; for when the tortoise was at length prevailed on to 
walk, he insisted on walking as straight as an arrow ; whereas 
the antediluvian tortoise's march was as crooked as a ram's 
horn." Now, it happens unfortunately for this statement, that 
the marks in the sandstone rock run in a direct line. It is 
true, the tortoise showed at first some unwillingness to stir, 
but, when he did move, he proceeded forward in quite as 
straight a course as his " antediluvian" progenitor. 

No remains of the tortoise have hitherto been found in strata 
older than the lias ; but we must not, on that account, refuse 
to believe that they existed at a still earlier period. The dis- 
coveries that are made every day in geology, though they tend 
to confirm and establish that science, should yet teach us how 
much remains to be learned respecting it.

Art. X. On the Crystallisation of Gold, By the Rev. John 
Stevens Henslow, Professor of Botany in the University of 
Cambridge. 

Dear Sir, 
The crystallisation of gold from a state of fusion is on 
record; but I am not aware that any one has observed a 
similar effect to have resulted from its solution in acid. Per- 
haps, therefore, you may consider the following notice worth 
inserting in the Naturalist's Magazine.

Cambridge^ Marchy 1828. J. S. Henslow. 

A small glass-stoppered vial, containing a solution of gold 
in a mixture of nitric and muriatic acids, had stood neglected

for a considerable time (perhaps four or five years) in a cup- 
board. Upon accidentally examining it, I found a portion of 
the acid had escaped, and the gold crystallised. This effect 
had probably been promoted by a flaw in the vial, which ex- 
tended through the neck, and a little way down its length. 
The stopper, in consequence, must have been slightly 
loosened, and thus allowed more space for the formation of a 
thin dendritic crystallisation of the gold. This was further 
continued down the inner surface of the vial, and was there 
sufiiciently thick to admit the impression of minute but dis- 
tinct crystalline facets. A small crystallised lump of gold 
lay at the bottom of the vial ; but I believe this had been 
originally attached to the rest, and merely fallen by its weight, 
as I have since observed to be the case in another portion. 
Around the stopper, and along the flaw, there was a saline 
concretion, which tasted like sal-ammoniac, and as ammonia 
was kept in the same cupboard, it had probably united with 
the muriatic acid as it exuded. Upon finding this specimen, 
I examined some other metallic solutions, and found a 
similar separation of the metal had taken place in a vial 
containing a solution of platina, and in another containing 
a solution of palladium. In both these cases, a thin, inter- 
rupted, and dendritic lamina of metal might be seen between 
the stopper and the neck; but the crystallisation had pro- 
ceeded no further. I unstoppered the vial containing the 
platina, and the lamina (as might have been expected) imme- 
diately disappeared in the form of a slight muddy film. The 
palladium I still possess. Probably this phenomenon may be 
of frequent occurrence ; but as the separation of the metal 
does not often extend below the neck of the vial, it may have 
passed unnoticed. These facts, if multiplied, may, perhaps, 
serve to throw some light upon the mode in which the den- 
dritic laminae of native gold, silver, &c. are formed in rocks. 



Art. XI. Introductory Shetch of the Objects and Uses of Me^ 
teorological Science. By E. W. Brayley, Jun. A.L.S. 

The narrow limits within which our knowledge of the 
physical constitution of the planet we inhabit is confined, 
have been frequent subjects of remark with general writers on 
Natural History. Little more of " the great globe " is cog- 
nizable to us than the configuration of its surface, with the 
vegetable productions which invest that surface, and the ani- 
mals by which it is peopled ; the affections, arrangement, and 

L 2 



i^8- Objects and Uses of Meteorology, 

structure of the fluid and solid matter, to an insignificant ex- 
tent, beneath ; and the nature and phenomena, to a height not 
exceeding that of the greater inequalities of the surface 
(themselves so proverbially inconsiderable in comparison with 
the earth itself) of the ever-moving mass of elastic fluid, or 
the atmosphere, which rests upon it. But unimportant as 
these may appear, when compared with the vast bulk of the 
earth itself, or with the still more stupendous magnitude of 
the system of worlds of which it forms a part, they compre- 
hend that region of our own world, in which Man — the 
being for whom all has been created — is destined to exist ; and 
they furnish, whether viewed merely in themselves, or in their 
relations to him, innumerable objects of delightful contem- 
plation. * 
Now, on taking a general view of this our domain in the 
system, and of the indefinite multitude of objects it presents,' 
we shall find them to consist of two classes ; which, though 
intimately connected together, as they exist in nature, are, 
in themselves, perfectly and essentially distinct, — possessing, 
in fact, opposite attributes. These two classes have been 
termed, by common consent among naturalists, inorganic 
bodies, and organic bodies or beings. The former, as their 
very name indicates, and as is the case with the less perfect 
subjects of science in general, are distinguished from the latter 
chiefly by negative qualities. They include the various sub- 
jects of the mineral kingdom, discriminated in an obvious and 
especial manner from those of the animal and vegetable king- 
doms, which constitute the class of organic or organised ex- 
istences, by not possessing the power of reproducing indi- 
viduals similar to themselves, and by undergoing increase of 
size merely in consequence of the addition of fresh matter 
Jrom *withcnit, not, like plants and animals, by the secretion or 
production of fresh matter from mthin. These inorganic 
bodies, it is evident, have been created, and exist, for the sake 
of the organic departments of nature, as they, in their turn, 
exist for the sake of Man. The surface of tlie earth, on which 
organic beings exist, consists of an aggregation of inorganic 
substances ; and the same substances, arranged in the most 
. exquisite and harmonious co-ordination, according to the 
peculiar quality of the life of each being respectively, form the 
basis of that organisation, or disposition of parts for the 
reception and manifestation of life, which is the grand cha- 
racteristic of the higher kingdoms of nature. These truths 
are so obvious, that they scarcely require illustration; but as 
every article in the Magazine of Natural History is intended 
ibr the perusal of the general reader,, as well as for, that of 



Objects and Uses of Meteorology, 149 

the man of science, it may be as well to exemplify them by 
reference to some particular instances. 

The soil, then, in which plants grow, and on which animals 
live and move, is derived, in the first instance, from the pul^ 
verisation of some stratum, or some rock, forming the ori- 
ginal surface of the earth ; this may be either granite, sand*- 
stone, clay, limestone, or chalk, &c. Now these rocks and 
strata consist of various inorganic bodies or minerals, ^gg^'^' 
gated together in various ways ; and the solid parts, forming 
the basis of the more delicate organisation of plants and ani- 
mals, consist also of similar substances, to which the arranger 
ment effected by the vital powers has given an oy^ganic form^ 
— -or disposed into structures and tissues of vessels, — for the 
purpose of receiving, adapting, and making use of the dif- 
ferent fluids destined to be the agents employed by the vital 
powers in sustaining the manifestation of life. Thus the reti^ 
culated epidermis, or outer coat of the plants which have hol- 
low stalks, including the reeds, the grasses, and the various 
species of cane, consists principally of the originally inor- 
ganic substance silica, of which, in various states of combina- 
tion, a great part of the earth*s surface is formed. Thus, 
also, the skeletons of the vertebrated animals are composed of 
the inorganic substance lime, combined with phosphoric acid i 
and the shells, which serve as external skeletons to the mol- 
luscous animals, including the different kinds of shell-fish, 
consist chiefly of the same earth combined with carbonic acidy 
or in the state oi carbonate of lime, which inorganic substance 
forms many great ranges of mountains, and many extensive 
plains. 

Having taken this glance at the two primary divisions of 
natural things, — the inorganic and the organic subjects of 
creation, — we will now proceed to examine the phenomena 
attending the distribution of the latter over the surface of the 
earth ; phenomena which are connected immediately and in 
a very important manner with the main subject of the prer 
sent article, namely, the objects and uses of meteorological 
science. But it appeared expedient, on entering so wide a 
field of enquiry, to take, at first, a comprehensive view of 
the relations to each other of several departments of the 
creation, in order to counteract the fallacious ideas of dis- 
union and independence among natural objects, which the 
segregation and separation of them in the mind, for the 
purpose of scientific investigation, has a tendency, from the 
imperfection of the human faculties, to produce. 

The life and well-being of organised nature in general, and 
of plants and animals in particular, are sustained primarily 

L 3 



150 Objects and Uses of Meteorologi/. 

by an unseen and mysterious energy operating within them ; 
but organised beings depend, for the outward support of 
their existence, or rather for the preservation of the substances 
on which their organisation is founded, in a fit condition for 
the use of the inward powers of life, on the heat and light of 
the sun. And in a mediate manner, therefore, they depend 
on the atmosphere, which is the medium by which the rays 
of that glorious luminary are accommodated to their reception. 
Hence they are distributed over the surface of the globe, with 
relation to the peculiar qualities of every class, according to 
certain laws by which we are accustomed to express the 
phaenomena of climate, and which are regulated, chiefly, by the 
relations to heat or temperature of the parts of the earth re- 
spectively inhabited by each group of animals or plants. 
These relations to temperature are of two kinds. The first 
depends on the position of the locality, or place where the 
beings naturally exist, with respect to the equator, or rather 
to the ecliptic, or, more strictly still, with'respect to the plane 
in which the earth revolves around the sun ; for on this rela- 
tion depends the temperature of the place, so far as it is pro- 
duced, directly, by the influence of the sun. The second of 
these relations to heat depends on the elevation of the locality 
above the mean level of the earth's surface, — usually esti- 
mated, for the purposes of science, from the level of the ocean, 
— for on this depends another cause of difference of tem- 
perature, in consequence of the decrease of density, as we 
ascend in the atmosphere, and the corresponding reduction of 
temperature by the increased capacity for heat of rare air; 
the highest situations being the coldest in each latitude 
respectively. 

According, then, to the laws of temperature, arising from 
the combined influence of latitude and altitude, as just ex- 
plained, are the innumerable subjects of organised nature 
distributed throughout the globe, whether the land, the 
waters, or the atmosphere be the principal scene of their 
existence. Next to the solar beams, as an agent in the sup- 
port of life, in all its various forms, is moisture, which appears 
indeed to operate as a medium, in conveying and imparting to 
the solid substances of organisation the influence of the im- 
ponderable agents, as heat, light, and electricity, as well as 
that of the vital energy itself. And the state of moisture 
depending primarily on the presence of aqueous vapour, its 
quantity and its tension or elasticity is of course finally de- 
pendent on temperature and on the agency of solar radiation. 
Certain plants and animals are }>eculiar, as is well known, to 
the tropical regions, where an unvarying high degree of heat 



Objects and Uses of Meteorology, 151 

prevails, with its necessary concomitant, a very humid at- 
mosphere, whence the richness and luxuriance of organic 
existence in these climes, in all its departments. Others 
thrive only in the temperate latitudes ; and others, again, like 
the Polar Bear and the Walrus, and, in the vegetable world, 
many Lichens, which are accommodated to sustain the cold 
of a region, the mean annual temperature of which is below 
the freezing-point, people the frigid zones, or clothe their 
rocks and plains with a peculiar though scanty herbage* 
From the combination of the two causes of temperature above 
described, an effect of great interest to the Meteorologist and 
the Naturalist results in the equatorial climates. In these the 
solar temperature is higher than in any other part of the 
globe ; and in these, also, the mountains and the elevations 
forming what is called table-land, are higher than elsewhere, 
ascending, of course, into comparatively colder regions of the 
atmosphere. It hence follows, that if we ascend, in the torrid 
zone, from the level of the sea to the summits of the moun- 
tains, we pass through all the various climates, with their 
respective gradations of organised matter, which each hemi- 
sphere of the entire globe presents, as we proceed from the 
equator to the pole. This is abundantly exemplified in the 
Floras of New Spain and Nepal, which have of late so im- 
mensely enriched the stores of the Botanist ; and the distri- 
bution of insects furnishes us with further illustrations of the 
phenomenon. 

In considering these laws, we may observe a very striking 
distinction between organic and inorganic matter. Inor- 
ganic bodies, which have no du'ect dependence, in the pre- 
sent state of the earth at least, on the solar heat or its con- 
sequences, are distributed throughout the globe, without any 
relation either to latitude or to altitude, as involving peculiarity 
of temperature. Thus, native gold and the ores of iron are 
found, indiscriminately, in every latitude, from the equator to 
the poles, and at every elevation above the level of the sea. 
Thus, also, the earthy substances, silica and carbonate of lime, 
with granite and limestone, rocks essentially composed of 
them, occur under the equator in Sumatra and South Ame- 
rica, in the temperate zones in the Alps and the British Isles, 
and within the arctic circle at Baffin's Bay ; whilst they are 
found at great depths below the mean level of the surface, as 
in mines, on the surface itself, and at every altitude above it, 
from the gentlest undulations of the land to the summits of the 
loftiest mountains. 

On attentively surveying the objects and phenomena of 
inorganic nature in general, we find that two, or more cor- 

L 4 



152 Objects and Uses of Meteorology. 

rectly, perhaps, three great divisions are presented to out* 
view. This department of creation embraces what is termed 
the mineral kingdom, which includes the various rocks and 
strata, and individual mineral substances composing the surface 
of the earth ; and also what we may perhaps not improperly 
call the Atmospheric kingdom of nature. For it seems obviously 
improper to refer the various aeriform fluids constituent of the 
atmosphere to the mineral kingdom, with which, howeverj 
they must be associated, unless we thus constitute for them a 
distinct province. And as the atmosphere extends its in- 
fluence in an equal degree over the three kingdoms, the ani-^ 
mal, the vegetable, and the mineral, though received by, and 
operating upon each, after a distinct manner, it would appear 
rather to be independent, and allied to all of them, than to be 
rightly included within any one. 

But these two divisions of inorganic nature, — the mineral and 
atmospheric kingdoms, — become amenable to each other's in- 
fluence, principally by means of an intermediate agent ; — by 
means of the ocean and the other repositories and sources of 
water, in its ordinary inelastic state of fluidity, with which the 
earth is replenished. This Aqueous kingdom of nature is the 
grand source whence the atmosphere derives its watery contents, 
which are poured down again to refresh and supply the ob- 
jects on the solid surface, — partly enter into their composition 
in various ways, and in part return to the ocean, to be again 
raised into the atmosphere by the agency of the sun, and un- 
dergo that perpetual circulation, which is as essential to the 
aggregate well-being of the objects on the globe's surface, as is 
the circulation of the blood to the life of the animal frame. 
By the ocean, the rivers, and the lakes, also, as repositories of 
temperature, the combined influence of the sun and the atmo- 
sphere on the organic substances which the " mineral kingdom" 
supports, is suitably modified for their reception and require- 
ments. 

Now it is the object of Meteorology to investigate and dis- 
cover the modes of operation, and the causes, instrumental 
as well as final, of the multitude of interesting phenomena, the 
influence of which on the vegetable and animal kingdoms we 
have briefly traced in the foregoing remarks. To this science 
belongs the examination of the force of radiation from the sun, 
or the temperature directly produced by his beams — the in- 
quiry into the constitution, mechanical as well as chemical, of 
that intimate mixture of gaseous bodies, which is the subject of 
what are called atmosphaic changes — the scrutiny of the laws 
governing the variations of climate — that also of those which 
regulate the diminution of heat in the atmosphere, in propor-

atmosphere, — and the acquirement of knowledge, in short, on 
every subject of science presented by the atmosphere itself, or 
by its modes of relation to the aqueous and mineral kingdoms, 
and the general laws of its influence on organised matter. 

This branch of Natural History also comprehends the exa- 
mination of two great series of phenomena, not strictly com- 
prised by the foregoing enumeration ; by which, on the one 
side, its boundaries are united with those of Physical Geogra- 
phy, and, on the other side, with those of Astronomy. The 
temperature of the interior of the earth itself, and that of the 
ocean, as well at the surface as at every accessible depth — 
subjects of the greatest interest, with respect not only to the 
presenf state of the earth, but also to its former physical con- 
dition — are so intimately connected with the temperature 
and other affections of the atmosphere, that the study of them 
becomes, in fact, a department of Meteorology. And the va- 
rious kinds of luminous and igneous meteors which appear 
within the atmosphere, though some of them originate.) in all 
probability, in distant regions of the solar system, — such as the 
zodiacal light, the polar lights, or Aurora Boredlis and Aus- 
trdlis ; the meteors called shooting-stars, and the stupendous 
masses of matter in combustion called Jtre-halls^ which cast 
down upon the earth immense blocks of red-hot iron, or 
showers of heated stones, — constitute another wide field of 
meteorological enquiry. 

It has been deemed proper, in commencing the meteoro- 
logical department of the Magazine of Natural History ^ to set 
out with a general outline of the bearings of Meteorology on 
the investigation of some other principal objects of the natur- 
alist's attention. On resuming this article in a future number, 
we shall proceed to a more specific and detailed view of the 
subjects of meteorological research.

Art. I. Experimental Researches in Natural History, By John 
Murray, F.S. A. F.L.S. &c. London. 12mo,''pp. 177. 6s. Re- 
viewed by M. 

The author of this little work has chosen some of the most 
remarkable phenomena in nature for description and iUustra- 
tion. His first two subjects are on the light of the glow-worm 
and the luminosity of the sea. Both are treated with much 
practical knowledge, gained, it would appear, from extensive 
and patient investigation. He first speaks of the nature of 
light, and declares himself a follower of Newton, in the opinion 
that it is " material, and consisting of particles, exceedingly 
minute, cast off from the luminous surface," and rejects the 
idea of Descartes and others, that light is only a " mere 
quality." 

The author next adverts to the origin of light, but which is 
the least luminous part of his essay. Descending to his mun- 
dane object, he considers, in his way, reflected, phosphoric, 
electric, and spontaneous light emitted by various minerals, 
animals, vegetables, and their combinations. 

The luminosity of the sea, afterwards fully treated of, he 
says is caused by the presence of luminous insects, as the 
Cancer fulgens, shining crab, &c. ; and many instances of 
spontaneous light are evolved by chemical processes and com- 
binations, under the action of heat, as the Chlorophane 
{chloros^ green, phaifio^ to shine; gives out a beautiful apple- 
green light when placed on a heated iron ; petalite {petaloji, a 
thin plate ; laminar fracture) rubelite {rubellus, reddish ; colour), 
tungstate of lime, anatase, &c. 

Many substances, according to Mr. Skrimshire, emit light 
on being brought within the circuit of an electric current, as 
alum, sugar, chalk, &c. 

Some diamonds emit light in tlie dark, and especially, 
according to Boyle, if slightly heated, rubbed, or compressed. 
*' Canton's phosphorus," not described by the author, " and 
the Bolognian stone, are phosphorescent when heated." Of 
this last curious substance, it has been said by naturalists, that 



Murray* s Researches in Natural History, 155 

it retains the light of the sun for several hours after being 
exposed to it; but Mr. Murray takes no notice of this pro- 
perty, only that it becomes luminous, like many other sub- 
stances, on being heated, independent of hght. He also points 
out the potato, decayed wood, several fish, as mackerel, whiting, 
&c., as emitting light ; and of plants, the Tremella meteorica, 
the Indian cress, and the subterranean Rhizamorpha [rhiza^ 
root, morphe, form ; resemblance) also evolve light in certain 
temperatures. 

Percussion and friction are common sources of light, and 
many instances of luminous exhibitions occur in chemical 
practice, as well as in nature, which lead to the conclusion, 
that " the light in luminous animals is a consequence of, and 
has its being in, a peculiar organisation." 

The luminous spherulae of the glow-worm is a transparent 
sac or capsule, through which, as through a window, the light 
shines : it is quite distinct from chemical combustion and solar 
light. Of the latter the author gives a concise description, 
which may be best detailed in his own words. 

" When a beam of solar light is intercepted by a prism, it 
unfolds a very beautiful and interesting spectacle. Seven 
colours are presented; and the * bow of promise in the storm' 
affords a magnificent illustration of its phenomena. The colours 
thus unveiled are violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, 
and red; and they are refrangible in this order, the violet 
being the most easily refracted or bent, and the red with diffi- 
culty refracted. Agreeably to the doctrine of chromatics, 
taught us by Sir Isaac Newton, when all the colours are ab- 
sorbed the object is black. Black, therefore, is the absence 
of all colour. On the other hand, when all the colours are 
returned or reflected, the object is white ; when a particular 
colour is reflected, while the others are absorbed, the body 
appears of that particular tint." It is added, " that colour is 
the gift of light, numerous phenomena concur to assure us;" 
but he also avers that " there remain many circumstances ex- 
tremely difficult to be accounted for; so that colours are to 
be considered accidental rather than essential properties of 
bodies." This part of his observations on light would, per- 
haps, have been clearer had he said that colours are the gift 
of form and position. 

After some further disquisition on light and colours, in 
which a considerable share of sound philosophical knowledge 
is elicited, he comes to the examination of the light of the 
glow-worm. 

Of luminous insects in this country, the iampyris {lampo, 
to shine, pyr^ fire) noctiluca (noctthica, a candle) (^. 58.), 




156 Murraif^ Besehrches i?i Natural History 

or glow-worm, and the ^colop^ndra el^ctrica, are the most 
conspicuous and common. The 
^Scolopendra is found in Hunt- 
ingdonshire, and the Lampyris 
splendida in the vicinity of 
^Oswestry. The male glow- 
worm yields light as well as the 
female, but much fainter. The 
eggs are also, in some degree, 
luminous. Their light, which 
they have power to extinguish 
at pleasure, proceeds from bril- 
liant spots on the three last 
rings of the body, under the 
tail ; the luminous matter is a yellow substance, contained 
in vesicles; and when these vesicles are removed entire, 
they shine for some time afterwards ; but if lacerated, they are 
extinguished. The shining substance, the author thinks, is 
not phosphoric, but monochromatic, and is a gummo-albumi- 
nous substance. He thinks, the only use of this insect*s lamp 
is, either as a guide to its food, or as a sign to nightingales 
where to find their prey. No notice is taken of the old and 
most rational conjecture, that the light of the apterous female 
is only a signal to the coleopterous male. The propensity of 
the males flying towards light, in such numbers as sometimes 
to cover a table round the lighted candle, in an open room, is 
a presumptive proof of this last conjecture. Naturalists differ 
in opinion respecting the existence of the ignis fatuus ; and 
those that admit its existence, differ as to its character ; some 
insisting, as our author does, that it appears " as a glow of 
lambent flame," while others assert that it is only a luminous 
fly. It is probable that both phenomena have been seen. 

On the Luminosity of the Sea, — The light of the sea has 
been ascribed to various causes ; by some to phosphorescence, 
the effect of animal decomposition ; to the imbibition of solar 
light, analogous to the diamond, and to an electric effect in- 
duced by friction; while others have more plausibly assigned 
it to the presence of luminous animals, and of these the Me- 
dusa pelliicens, and hemispherica, Limulus noctilucus, &c. 
have been described." This phenomenon, so commonly seen 
every where, more especially in the Atlantic, under the bows 
of a ship, or in storms, has been settled long ago; and, 
no doubt, is caused by phosphorous mollusca floating on 
the surface of the water. The author claims the discovery, 
that this appearance on the sea is a presage of a storm ; and, if 
future observations prove it to be so, it may be of ihe utmost 



Mun-ai/s Researches in Natural History, 157 

importance to mariners. On this point, his concluding para- 
graph deserves repubhcation : " We dare scarcely speculate, 
touching the design of this singular distinction. This much, 
we know, that Almighty Goodness has made nothing super- 
fluous or in vain. The visitation of luminous animals seems 
connected with meteorological phenomena ; and it would be 
interesting to ascertain, from different parts of the coast of 
G^^eat Britain, what kind of luminous animals generally con- 
tribute to the effect." 

On the Phenomenon of the Chameleon, — This reptile is aii 
inhabitant of intertropical climates ; it belongs to the lizard 
family, and is particularly remarkable for the varying colours 
of its skin. Our author's experience of the nature of this 
animal has been directed to ascertain the cause of these 
changes, which, he says, " are depicted in such varying 
shades, that the magic of the necromancer's rod takes not the 
sense of vision more completely captive than do these ephe- 
meral and sportive hues." 

His convictions on this wonderful property are, that the 
changes are caused by the circulation of the blood of the rep- 
tile, and that increased temperature, either of the ambient air 
or of its own body, produces all the variations of the skin. 
And, as the passions of the human mind change the colour of 
the skin as well as the form of the features, and according to 
the rapidity of the flow of blood, so Mr. Murray thinks that 
the feelings of the chameleon may also, in some measure, pro-: 
duce analogous changes in the reflecting surface of the skin. . 

On the Ascent of the Spider into the Atmosphere. — Gossamer 
has been long noticed by both poets and naturalists. About 
the beginning of the last century, it was supposed to be con- 
densed vapour. Geoffroy gave it as his opinion, that it was a 
web spun by the ^^carus (tick) telarius {tela, a web), on the 
north side of trees ; and being from thence dispersed by the 
wind, covers the fields with those innumerable threads ! It is 
now known to be produced by many different kinds of spidersj 
particularly the flying spiders. Our author has paid particu- 
lar attention to the economy of these insects, and assures u§ 
that they have actually the power of projecting their threads 
to a considerable distance, and by such means transporting 
themselves from the ground to any elevation, or from the 
top of one elevation to another. But what is still more asto- 
nishing, he conceives that these threads are electric, or so 
actuated by that subtle element, that buoyancy is imparted, 
and the baseless shrouds of the aerial traveller are, with itself, 
projected aloft into the highest regions of the air ! 



158 Murrat/s ResearcJie& i?i Natwal History, 

There are but very few spiders, which, in crawling over 
uneven surfaces, do not leave behind them a thread, serving 
as a cable, or rather a line of suspension, lest they should fall, 
or be blown off from any eminence ; consequently, the whole 
surface of the ground, throughout the summer months, is 
covered with their network ; not only with webs of the ground 
spider, which may be called personal property, but from innu- 
merable threads of vagabonds. This accumulation creates no 
wonder, because it is certain that these threads, however deli- 
cate, are at the same time durable. But that this tissue is 
constantly increasing, may be seen by following the plough 
for a short space : for no sooner has the team finished one 
land or ridge, but the fresh ground is quickly interlaced with 
threads, which glisten in the sunbeam. There is no account- 
ing for this, except on the facts stated by the author, viz. that 
the air in fine weather is filled with the excursive threads of 
the impennous ^ranea aeronautica. The insect is often de- 
tected at the end of its thread, with its little arms extended, 
and balancing itself like a bird, and always proceeding before 
the wind. This direction of their flight always accounted for 
the connection between tree and tree, or hedge and hedge ; 
moreover, the insect by its instinctive sagacity, in com- 
mitting a coil of its thread to the wind, and taking its chance 
of a distant attachment, could then transport itself in safety. 
But the author has seen threads projected or propelled in a 
close room, where there could be no current of air to cari-y 
the same in any direct line ; and so far the relation is most 
interesting. 

Many curious experiments were made by the author, to 
prove that electricity, either positive or negative, was an agent 
in the movements of this spider, and the results go far to esta- 
blish his hypothesis. This opinion, however, is refuted by 
J. Blackwall, Esq. in Lin, Trans..^ vol. xv. part ii. p. 449. who 
proves that spiders have no power of propelling their webs, 
without assistance from the wind ; and that the cobwebs seen 
floating in the air, are raised from the surface of the ground, 
by the action of air highly rarefied by a cloudless sun. 

Mr. Murray also thinks that spiders are attracted by musi- 
cal sounds ; but it is more probable that they descend from 
ceilings, &c. towards an instrument from an impulse of fear, 
caused by the vibration of the air, than from any relish for 
melody. In this section of the book the writer has many per- 
tinent remarks on the structure and economy of the insect 
creation : all showing how important it is to the other branches 
of animated nature, as affecting vegetation, and even man him- 
self. Insects can, and actually do, change the features of the

face of the earth, by creating new stations for the abode, in- 
dustry, and all the local enjoyments of man. In the greatest 
depths of the ocean, the despicable zoophyte {zoon, an ani- 
mal, phyton, a plant ; partaking of both natures) founds its 
habitations. The most remarkable of these is the coral struc- 
ture, which, gradually enlarging in dimension, from the 
bottom upwards, at last rises above the surface of the sea, and 
becomes in time clothed with vegetation, birds, insects, and all 
the aggregations of surrounding waters, is at last seized on, and 
falls under the dominion of man. This idea is beautifully ex- 
pressed by Humboldt in his Physionome des Vegetauoc^ Tableaux 
de la Nature, p. 11. 

On the Torpidity of the common Tortoise. — This is a curious 
account of the temporary stagnation, or suspension of active 
life in the tortoise, dormouse, and other animals called sleepers. 
During this cessation of action in the winter months, it has 
been proved that the temperature of sleepers is diminished ; 
the circulation of their blood is slower ; respiration less fre- 
quent, and sometimes entirely suspended ; the action of their 
stomach and digestive organs are also suspended; and the 
irritabihty and sensibility of the muscular and nervous powers 
are diminished. Heat and air are the only agencies which 
rouse them from their death-like lethargy. This paper con- 
tains historical accounts of individual tortoises, which have 
been kept by some of the English bishops at their palaces. In 
the library of Lambeth Palace is the shell of one brought there 
in J 623 ; it lived until 1730, and was killed by being carelessly 
exposed to the inclemency of the weather. Another at the 
episcopal palace at Fulham, procured by Bishop Laud, in 
1628, died in 1753. One at Peterborough was known to have 
lived 220 years ! This animal was seen by the author in 1813, 
and of which he gives an interesting account. 

On the torpidity of animals, the author takes occasion to 
remark, that the lethargy of the toad and lizard may continue 
without the extinction of life for ages. Both these animals 
have been found alive imbedded in stone ; " a toad was found 
under the coal seam, in the iron-stone over which it rested, in 
a coal-mine at Auchincruive in Ayrshire." This circumstance, 
in the author's opinion, completely invalidates the Huttonian 
theory of the primitive formation of the earth ; and in course 
shows his belief in that which is called the Neptunian.

" The author proposes to commence, on the 1st July next, with 32 pages 
of letter-press, instead of 16, as heretofore; to continue, at least, that 
quantity monthly ; and to complete two volumes, with an index and appen- 
dix relative to their contents, annually, on the 1st of June. But as it is 
obvious that this arrangement cannot be carried into effect without consi- 
derable increase of expense, the price of each number, from the above 
period, will be advanced to five shillings; and in order to render the 
volumes now in progress, of equal bulk and value with the succeeding, a 
supplementary number, containing about 100 pages of letter-press, illus- 
trated with three figures of lepidopterous insects, will be published on the 
30th June next, completing the description of the Harpalidae, the Diurna, 
and the Crespuscularia, the price of which will be eleven shillings. And, 
as the printing of the author's St/stematic Catalogue is rapidly proceeding, 
and the catalogue itself is drawing to a close, the author is now enabled to 
make a more correct statement of the extent of this work. He therefore 
undertakes to complete, as far as practicable, the description of the insects 
enumerated in his catalogue in 155 numbers, including the 12 already pub- 
lished, so that his labours will cease in ten years ; and he trusts, that the 
regularity with which the work has hitherto appeared, and the circumstance 
of his having already exceeded the stipulated quantitv of plates and letter*

will be received as pledges of the fulfilment of his intentions, so far as rests 
with himself. 

" The advantages resulting from the arrangements are evident; as the 
entire work, although containing the same quantity of matter as at first 
proposed, will not only be completed in half the period it would otherwise 
have occupied, but the aggregate expense will be diminished about one 
third ; and no less than 104 genera of insects, including the descriptions, 
&c. of nearly 600 species, will be finished in fourteen months, illustrated 
with 98 figures, embracing 80 mostly very rare species; 54 of Coleoptera, 
and 26 of Lepidoptera; and, for the future, nearly every tenth species will 
be figured, and about 800 described annually. 

" Finally, the author begs to refer his readers to the review of his first eight 
numbers, in No. XI. of the Zoological Journal^ and in p. 472^ of Vol. IV. of 
the Introduction to Entomology, as unprejudiced testimonials of the charac- 
ter of his work." {Advert, on Cover of No. XIII.) 

Bennet, John Whitchtirch, Esq. F.H.S., and Member of the Literary and

the living Specimens. London. 4to, 5 pis. One Guinea. To be con- 
tinued monthly, and completed in Six Numbers. 

In the prospectus it is stated, that, in Ceylon, the fishes are not less beau- 
tiful in appearance, than they are for the most part delicious as food, and 
that of many of them neither drawing nor description has been given to the 
public. The plates of Mr. Bennet's work, it is stated, will be " accurate 
fac-similes of the original drawings, all of which have been made from the 
living fish. Several of these specimens are so extraordinary, that they might 
be taken for mere creatures of the artist's imagination ; but they will be 
accompanied by a certificate from the head men of the Fisher's Caste 
affirming them to be correct delineations. The descriptive portion of the 
work will combine such local information as the author has been able to 
collect, with so much as can be gleaned from preceding writers on the sub- 
ject. The Cingalese name of each specimen will be given, together with 
the Linnean, wherever it can be obtained. 

" In order that the greatest accuracy may be attended to in the number 
of radii in the fins and gill-covers of the fishes delineated, those particular 
parts, prepared in a dry state, and classed in boxes, together with the ori- 
ginal drawings, agreeably to the numbers of the work to which they have 
reference, may be seen at Mr. Morris's office, so. Regent Street, Pall- Mall." 

The contents of No. I. are : 

1. Scorppe^na {skorpioSy a scorpion ; supposed power of inflicting incurable 
wounds) volitans (volito, to fly about). The native name of this fish is 
Great Fire, from its colour. The essential 
specific character is, " pectoral fins(^g. 62. a) 
longer than the body." The description is 
as follows : — 

Branchiostegous (branchiae, gills, siege, a 
covering) rays (b) six. Dorsal {dorsum, 
l)ack) (c i), twenty-four, thirteen of them 
spinous, varied with black and reddish- 
brown ; the colours stronger on the spinous 
rays than on the others. Pectoral ( pectus,

spinous. Caudal {canda, the tail) (^), twelve. " Although Linnaeus, in 
naming, as well as in his descriptions of this animal, would make it 
appear to be possessed of the power of flying, the membranes of the 
pectoral fins are not, to appearance, sufficiently united or proportioned 
to the body to admit of volitation; and, indeed, the native fishers confirm 
this position."

on the southern coast of Ceylon ; and 
being considered by the native fishers 
unwholesome, from a sort of food to 
which it is partial, as well as to the cop- 
per of ships, is never made use of. It 
attains a very large size, and is called 
Kola Handah, Leaf Moon, by the natives, 
from the resemblance it bears in the 
dorsal fin to the leaf of a marine plant ; 
and, in the shape of the body, to that of 
a moon." To those who are curious in fishes, this work must aiFord a rich 
treat ; it is executed in the very best manner, and not high priced, consider- 
ing the splendour of the engravings. 

Botanical Periodicals. 

The Botanical Magazine, for May, 
^contains Zygopetalon {zygos, a pair, 
petalon, a petal) rostratum. {fig.Q'^.) 
An orchideous epiphyte, of which only 
one other species has been figured ; 
and both by Dr. Hooker, the founder 
of the genus. " The credit of intro- 
ducing this fine plant, from Demerara 
to the Liverpool botanic garden, is 
due to C. S. Parker, Esq." — Cactus 
alata {fig. 65.) is a curious species sent 
from the Organ Mountains, near Rio 
Janeiro, by William Harrison, Esq., of 
Rio, to the rich collection of his sister, 
Mrs. Arnold Harrison, of Aigburgh^. 
near Liverpool. The entire plant 
grows from 1 ft. to 2 ft. high, in a pro-

liferous manner, {fig. 65.) For the sake of our inexperienced readers, we 
shall give Doctor Hooker's description : — 
" Joints (^g. 65. a to b) from 4 in. to 6 in. in 
length, oblong, remarkably compressed ; vary- 
ing in breadth, from 1 in. to 3 in. ; the margins 
slightly thickened, crenato-iobate, everywhere | 
glabrous. There is a distinct mid-rib {fig. 66. c) 
running through the centre of these, and bun- 
dles of vessels forming lateral thickened nerves 
or ribs, leading off 
from it, and extend- 
ing in a curve, 
whose convexity is 
uppermost {d) to 
the crenatures. The 
colour of the plant 
is rather a dark 

green, the ribs and margin often reddish. 
Flowers {fig. 66. e) numerous upon the joints, 
solitary in each crenature, small, and not unlike 
those of the Rhlpsalis tribe. The base is occu- 
pied by the germen (/), which is nearly sphe- 
rical, pale green, and smooth. Calyx (g) of 
three small, oval, concave, brownish, scariose 
leaflets, but gradually becoming larger and more 
petaloid, and passing almost insensibly into the five pale yellowish-green 
spreading petals (/t); tube none. Stamens (i) numerous, inserted within 
the united bases of the calyx and corolla. Filaments {k) rather longer 
than the corolla, and white. Anthers (/) didymous, yellowish w hite. Style 
{m) filiform, as long as the stamens; stigmas (n) four, or generally five, 
linear, recurved, pubescent, white. 

Dioscor^a [Pedacius Dioscorides, a Greek physician) ci n n am omi folia, the 
Cinnamon-leaved Dioscorea, or Yam, is a native of the woods about Rio de 
Janeiro, also sent to this country by Mr. Harrison. It deserves the atten- 
tion of the young naturalist, not only as being the potato of tropical climates, 
but as having the male and female flowers on different plants, and conse- 
quently belonging to the class Dioe'cia (t/w, twice, oi/cos, a house) of Lin- 
naeus, and to the order of this class Hexandria, as having six stamens. 
Sprengel, and other moderns, however, who propose not to take the cir- 
cumstance of the sexes being in different plants, into consideration in form- 
ing the classes, but to be guided entirely by the stamens and pistils, refer 
Dioscorefl to Hexandria Monogynia. This genus and one or two others 
form a natural order of themselves, the type of which being Dioscorc-a, the 
order, in conformity to a fundamental rule, 
alluded to (p. 36.), is called Diosc6re<r. Only 
the male plant {fig. 67.) is yet known. 
The following is its description by Dr. 
Hooker. " Hoot a roundish, ill-shapen 
tuber, as large as the human head. Stem 
{a) twining, branched, striated, pubescenti- 
hirsute, hairs brownish : whole plant destitute 
of prickles ; leaves alternate, petiolate {b)y 
oblongo-acuminate, quite entire, of a texture 
between coriaceous and fleshy, shining, hav- 
ing three distinct nerves or ribs (r), which 
are prominent on the under side, where the 
leaf is of a paler green, and where, near the 
base, are some dark dots of glands ; the 
margin itself, when held between the eye

and the light, is seen to have a thin pellucid margin. Petioles (d) from 
three fourths of an inch to an inch long, hairy like the stem. Male 
racemes {e) apparently always solitary, axillary, hairy, often compound 
at the base : pedicels (/) branched, each with a lanceolate bractea (g). 
Perianth [h) cup-shaped, deeply six-partite, the segments (z) spreading, 
oblong, yellow-green. Stamens {k) six, opposite to the divisions of the 
perianth." 

The Botanical Magazine y for June, contains Cycas circinalis (circus^a circle; 
ring-like joints of the trunk). A palm well known in the Molucca Islands, 
where the fruit is eaten, and sago said, but erroneously it is believed, to be 
taken from the trunk. The leaves of this palm are used by the Thomaean 
Catholics of Malabar, as those of the date palm (Phoe'nix dactylifera) are 
by the Catholics of Europe, on Palm Sundays, and by the Jews on the feasts 
of the Passover. In a botanical point of view, the C'ycas circinalis is inte- 
resting, as forming the connecting link between Monocotyledones and Di- 
cotyledones. " Linnaeus ranked the Cycas among the j)alms, but observed, 
* Foliatio circinalis more Filicum peragitur' [It puts forth a circular foli- 
ation after the manner of ferns] ; Jussieu and Ventenat, along with the 
ferns ; Jacquin, in an artificial system, considered it to belong to the class 
Dioe'cia, and order Polyandria; Smith looked upon it, along with Zamia, as 
constituting an intermediate order between the Palmse and the Filices. In 
Persoon's Synopsis, the natural order CVcadeae is established; and the 
jilace of it suggested, corresponding with the ideas just mentioned of Sir 
James Smith. Our learned countryman, Mr. Brown, in his inestimable 
Prodi'omus Florce Novcb Hol/dndice, has placed the order the last of the 
Monocotyledones, immediately before the Dicotyl(^dones; calling the em- 
bryo, indeed, pseudo-dicotyledonous. The true structure of this embryo is 
now completely ascertained by the labours of Du Petit Thouars, and the 
late admirable Richard, and this latter has determined itto have the closest 
affinity with the dicotyledonous plants ; and amongst them, with the Coni- 
ferae, near which he consequently places the order. Here, however, it must 
be acknowledged, that the natural habit and aspect of the vegetation are 
sacrificed to minute differences in the fructifica- 
tion. In the structure of the stem, in the mode 
of growth, in the situation and appearance of the 
leaves, the Cycas has the closest affinity with the 
palms, and is in these particulars as far removed 
as can be from the pines." Frandscea (Francis, 
Emperor of Germany) Uopeana, (Mrs. Thomas 
Hope of Deepdene) [Jig. 68.); Scrophularineae.

only are the flowers of a rich purple blue colour, 
but they are excessively fragrant." CEnothera

The Botanical Register, for May, contains Agave geminiflora (figured in 
Gard. Mag., vol. ii. p. 96.), Twin-flowered Agave. A South American lilia- 
ceous plant, with rush-looking leaves, and a flower stem which has grown 
as high as 24 ft. at Lainate, near Milan, and 14 ft. high in Mr. Knight's 
nursery in the King's Road. " In the gardens both of this country and of 
the Continent, it was, before flowering, confounded with Buonaparte«

rowness of the leaves, which are otherwise so 

different, that no person who possessed the slightest 

acquaintance with the natural affinities of plants 

could have fallen into the mistake. • But at that 

time botany was too often mere empiricism, a 

stigma from which it has not yet recovered in this 

country. The botanist of artificial arrangements 

could do nothing without his stamens and styles ; 

but, for the student of nature, no better evidence 
upon this plant than 
the leaves offered 
woidd have been de- 
sired, to determine 
whether or not it was a

the calyx), a fine purple-flowering, autumnal plant ; 
and Cartkamm {quortom, to paint, Arab.; red paint prepared from stamens) 
tinctorius {tinctoriusy dying, from tincttira, a dye ; in allusion to the colour- 
ing principles of its flowers). The florets are gathered when they begin 
to expand, and dried on a kiln, for future use in dying. Pink saucers 
and vegetable rouge are prepared from these flowers, which may be pur- 
chased from druggists under the name of safiiower, in the following man- 
ner : — " Wash safflower till no stain is given to the water, and then dry 
it. Of this take half an ounce; infuse it a short time in a pint of water, 
in which a dram of the subcarbonate of soda has been previously dis- 
solved ; strain off" the liquid, to which add an ounce of finely levigated 
French chalk. The alkali will hold the colouring matter of the safflower 
in solution, and the chalk will remain colourless ; but, by adding a little 
tartaric or citric acid, the alkali will be neutralised, and the red colouring 
matter, which is not soluble in simple water, being set at liberty, will fall to 
the bottom, combined with the chalk. Thus a beautiful pigment is pro- 
duced, which may be dried and further levigated for spreading on saucers ; 
or, ground with a drop or two of olive oil, will form the Spanish or vege- 





some plants. 

The Scientific Journak. 
As these periodicals contain many valuable articles on natural history, 
we intend noticing them regularly as they appear, for the sake of referring 
to the articles. Of Branded Quarterly Journal a new series was com- 
menced above a year ago, with the avowed intention of rendering it more 
suitable for general readers ; and, in this respect, it is certainly greatly im- 
proved. No. v., for April, contains the natural history of the Earwig, by 
our correspondent, Mr. Main, who has shown that the weapon-like appen- 
dages at the end of the abdomen are not so much intended for defence or 
offence, as for folding and unfolding the wings of the insect ; and that the 
vulgar notion of this creature entering the human ear is not founded on 
fact : anatomists, he says, deny it ; and he adds, w ith the true feeling of a 
naturalist, " it is a pity that this is not generally known, as it might defend 
the constitutionally timid from unnecessary alarm, and give a more favour- 
able idea of that part of the animal creation, which forms a most necessary 
link in the chain of being." Achatindlla (dim. of achates, an agate; 
resemblance), a new group of terrestrial shells, is described by another of 



Scientific Jotirnals, 169 

our correspondents, Mr. Swainson ; the orchideous genus Macrae'a, from 
Chile, by Professor Lindley. Under miscellaneous intelligence are thirteen 
notices from the Bulletin Universelle, JamiesoiCs Journal, Brewster s Journal^ 
the Annales de Chimie, &c. ; the most interesting of which, as it appears to 
us, is a notice from the Bulletin Universelle of a disease of silkworms, and 
its cure. In the south of France, silkworms very often become yellow 
from the attacks of a malady called the jaundice. The remedy there is 
what gardeners in Britain would adopt, as a destructive power, in the case 
of worms of any kind ; but in France it is said to have been employed for 
twenty years with perfect success. It consists in powdering the worms with 
quicklime, by means of a silk sieve, and then giving them mulberry leaves, 
moistened with a few drops of wine. The safety of the worms under the 
powdering of quicklime depends, no doubt, on the absence of moisture. 

The Philosophical Magazine and Annals of Philosophy, for May and June, 
contains some interesting philosophical articles, and full accounts of the 
proceedings of several societies. 

GilVs Technological Repository, for May, contains the continuation of a 
very interesting series of microscopical observations, some curious remarks 
on the cocoa-nut, and the mode of cultivating it in the East. In the June 
number the microscopic article is continued, and some farther observations 
on the culture of palms, scitamineous plants, and the black pepper, in the 
East, taken from Buchannan^s Journey from Madras. 

Brewster's Journal ?or April contains: — Notice of Meteorological Phe- 
nomena at Patna,in the East Indies. — Observations on the formation of Ice 
in India, by which it appears that the opinion " repeated by one author 
after another," that ice is formed by evaporation from porous pans, is erro- 
neous. " The fact is, that the natives use porous pans from necessity ; but 
so well are they aware that the porosity of the vessels is of no advantage, that 
they usually rub them with grease," as the writer supposes, to admit of 
more easily extracting the ice, and to keep the straw, in which the vessels 
are placed, in a perfectly dry and non-conducting state. The only author 
who understands the subject is said to be Dr. Wells. The writer has re- 
peated the experiments mentioned by Dr. Wells in his Treatise on Deiu, 
" and sometimes with singular results," all proving that the ice is produced 
by radiation into a clear atmosphere. The writer, David Scott, Esq., never 
found it practicable to make ice when the temperature exceeded 41° on the 
level of the pits. — On the Natural History of Tabasheer, the siliceous 
concretion in the Bamboo, by Dr. Brewster. — An Account of a New Sea 
Serpent, or serpentiform fish {fig. 78.), by Dr. Harwood, Professor of 
Natural History in the Royal 
Institution. It was found in 
Davis's Straits, is 4 ft. 6 in. 
long, with a purplish-black 
granular skin, small fins, and a 
slender tape-like tail, which is 
continued 1 ft. 8^ in. beyond 
the extremity of the dorsal __ 

fin. Dr. Harwood has given i ?'"!'''':'¦¦'!''?' | i , , i , ,__]^« 

it the name of Ophiognathus ampullaceus, or bottle-like. — Account of 
the Tracks of Footmarks of Animals, found impressed in Sandstone, in 
the Quarry of Corncockle Muir, Dumfries-shire, by the Rev. Dr. Dun- 
can. These footmarks were discovered fifteen or sixteen years ago; 
and, what shows the comparative indifference of past times to geological 
pursuits, their existence has never before been noticed in any scientific 




170 Scientific Jouitials, 

>vork. The foot-prints difler in size from that of a hare's paw to the hoof of 
a pony. On a slab forming part of the wall of a summer-house in Dr. Ehin- 
can's garden at the Manse of Ruthwell, there are 24 impressions, 12 of the 
right feet, as many of the left, and, consequently, six repetitions of each 
foot. Professor Buckland, with whom Dr. Duncan is in correspondence, 
considers that the animals must have been crocodiles or tortoises. — On the 
supposed Changes in the Meteorological Constitution of the different parts 
of the Earth during the Historical Period, by Professor Schow of Copen- 
hagen. This is a very interesting paper, but does not admit of abridgment. 
The author estimates the climate of different countries in remote periods of 
antiquity, by the plants mentioned in the Bible and other ancient works, 
as growing in them, as compared with the fossil remains of the antediluvian 
world. The paper is not completed, and therefore we cannot give his ge- 
neral conclusions. — Zoological Collections. Three species of bears, natives 
of India, are described, the crocodiles of the Ganges noticed, and an ac- 
count of the white elephant of Siara, and of a fight between a tiger and an 
elephant, from Finlayson^s Mission to Siam and Thibet. From these notices 
our readers will see that Dr. Breivster's Journal is of very great interest, 
even as a magazine of natural history. 

When the papers on chemistry, comparative anatomy, natural philosophy, 
and other branches of science, and the high scientific character of the con- 
ductor and his coadjutors are considered, it may safely be pronounced a 
periodical of first-rate merit. 

Jameson^s Philosophical Journal for April, contains : — Observations on 
the large brown hornet of New South Wales ; a very 
curious and interesting paper, in which, among other 
things, the author supposes that the hexagonal plan of< 
the cells is derived from the structure of the fore- 
legs of the hornet {fig. 19). — Analysis of a sour clay, 
used in acidulating sherbet, in Persia. The whitish- 
grey earth here alluded to, is found on the margins of 
sulphurous streams which issue from the bases of hills 
near Dalkee ; it has a sour milky taste, and consists 
principallyofsulphateoflime,with a little siliceous matter, 
acidulated by free sulphuric acid. — On the Natural His- 
tory of the Salmon, by Daniel Ellis, Esq. There are seven 
species of the genus iSalmo in the river Tay ; but this 
paper is confined to the S. salar, or common salmon, 
and treats of spawning and the evolution of the ova in the higher parts of 
rivers and streams ; of the growth and movements of the young brood to 
and from the sea during the first year of life j and of the migration of the 
salmon betwixt the river and the sea. In this very complete paper, it is 
proved that the grilse, which used to be considered as a fish of a different 
species from the salmon, is but a salmon in a certain stage of growth. For 
tne first thirty-three months of a salmon's life, it increases nearly at the 
rate of 1 lb. 1 oz. per month ; but in the first five months of its existence, 
that is, from April to August inclusive, it attains, in favourable circum- 
stances, to the weight of 8 lbs. From a great number of facts respecting 
the migrations of the salmon at different periods of its life, it would appear 
that the ova can only be hatched, and the young fish live, in fresh water ; 
that in the earliest period of a salmon's existence, salt water is fatal to it; 
that the causes of the alternate migrations of salmon are two — the search 
for food, and the impulse of propagation. 

[The Rev. Mr. Hendrick, in his Survey of Aberdeenshire^ assigns another 
cause, the annoyance of insects which live on their skin.] It is certain 
salmon receive a principal part of their food in the sea ; that the best are 
always caught in or near the sea; and that they fall off in their condition.

in proportion to their abode in rivers.— On the Temperature of the Interior 
of the Earth, by M. Cordier, Professor of Geology in the Garden of 
Plants at Paris. From experiments in mines, this writer is convinced that 
a subterranean heat exists, which is peculiar to the terrestrial globe, does 
not depend on the solar rays, and increases rapidly with the depth. — Note 
on Swallows ; by which it appears that oiling or soaping the corners of thie 
windows where they build, will deter them from doing so. — On the Do- 
mestication of Mammiferous Animals, by M. Frederick Cuvier. (Taken 
from the Memoires du Museum (THistoire NatureUe.) It appears that what 
we gall the domestication of animals, consists in our becoming members ol 
the society which these animals form among themselves. Man becomes the 
chief of its herd ; from the moment that an animal admits man as a mem- 
ber of its society, it is domesticated, — " as man could not enter into such 
society without becoming the chief of it." Applying these principles to 
wild animals, the apes and monkeys, notwithstanding their social instinct 
and intellect, are yet so violent and irritable, as to be incapable of all use- 
ful subjection. Among carnivorous animals, the seals, together with the 
various species of the dog tribe, would be the best adapted to attach them- 
selves to us, and serve us. M. Cuvier suggests, that the seal might be 
trained for fishing, as the dog is for hunting. Several animals peculiar to 
South America, having but very feeble means of defence, will, as that 
country is peopled, gradually disappear from the face of the earth. Aftei' 
other illustrations, the writer concludes, that all domestication is founded 
on the propensity which animals have to live together in herds, and to 
attach themselves to one another. " We obtain it only by enticement, 
and principally by augmenting their wants, and satisfying them. But we 
could only produce domestic individuals, and not races, without the con- 
currence of one of the most general laws of life, the transmission of the 
organic or intellectual modifications by generation. Here one of the most 
astonishing phenomena of nature manifests itself to us, the transformation 
of a fortuitous modification into a desirable form ; of a fugitive want into 
a fundamental propensity; of an incident habit into an instinct. This sub- 
ject is assuredly worthy of exciting the attention of the most accurate ob- 
servers, and of occupying the meditations of the most profound thinkers."

his greenhouse, till April, 1827, when it was put in a hot-house; there it 
became more lively, and began to croak like a frog. It lived on earth- 
worms, but did not care for food oftener than once in a week or ten days; it 
lived several hours at a time out of water, or several hours at a time under 
water, at pleasure, being truly amphibious, and capable of breathing

Dog-breaking. London. Pamph. 8vo, pp. 23. 2s. 6d. 

This little pamphlet contains a few short but excellent rules for breaking 
in pointers or spaniels. Any dog that will hunt for game may be taught to 
point by proper training ; should never be hunted where there are hares, 
until they are perfectly steady to partridges ; should be taught to lie down 
at command, and not to rise till touched by the hand. It is easy to check 
dogs that are too resolute ; but, when overawed, they become difficult to 
manage, and very liable to blink. Slight punishments, frequently repeated, 
are more effectual than too much severity at once. All pointers should 
drop when a bird rises ; not be allowed to run up to a falling bird. If the 
word " down" be given when a bird rises, he will soon take the rising of 
the bird as the signal to drop; and, in time, the scent will be the signal at 
which he will lie down, this being all that is wanted. Whatever is soon 
learned by a dog is soon forgotten ; and it is only by time and patience that 
an animal can be confirmed in the habits which it is wished he should 
retain.

In the introduction, the author informs us, that his object is to describe 
a series of lepidopterous insects, which form part of a general entomologi- 
cal collection from Java, contained in the Museum of the Honourable East 
India Company. The work will be conducted with a steady reference to 
his Annulosa Javdnica, and the Horcc Entomologicce of William Sharp Mac- 
leay, Esq. " The plan of the former will be my constant guide, and the 
comprehensive views detailed in the latter will afford the means of regu- 
lating the arrangements suggested by the former, and of comparing and 
correcting my mode of proceeding. Accordingly, my principal aim will be 
to discover the natural affinities, and to follow them in the arrangement. 
Wherever my materials are sufficiently extensive, I shall trace the series 
through its whole extent, and endeavour to show, that in this department 
also, the principle so clearly developed by Mr. Macleay, is exemplified in the 
succession or chain of affinities returning into themselves, or forming circles. 
In the series which will thus be submitted to my close examination, I shall 
endeavour to discover and point out the typical forms which indicate the 
subdivisions, and distinguish the groups. But, as it may be expected that, 
in a local collection, many forms must be deficient, and the thread of affi- 
nities often interrupted, 1 shall carefullj' notice these interruptions, with the 
design of supplying thena, as far as necessary, from other sources of inform- 
ation. The analogies existing between objects of distant or of neighbouring 



Miss Kent's Sylva7i Sketches. 173 

groups will also be pointed out, wherever they may have been satisfactorily 
developed." (p. 5.) 

The author mentions an attempt at an arrangement of Lepidoptera, ac- 
cording to their metamorphoses, by Messrs. Denis and Schieffermiiller, of 
Vienna, as harmonising with the circular or quinary system of Macleay. Ac- 
cording to this system all the Lepidoptera may be referred to one or other of 
the following types of form, viz. PapilionidaB,Sphingadae, Hornby cidae,iV^octu- 
idae, and Phalaenidae. Some remarks are next given on eachof these tribes, 
and the descriptive catalogue commences with the character of Papilionidae, 
and its different branches (stirpes), and the genera formed from them. Four 
coloured plates exhibit some of the more remarkable species and their 
members, in the larva, chrj'^alis, and perfect state. These plates are beauti- 
fully engraved and coloured, and the work may be considered as highly 
scientific, and a most valuable contribution to entomology.

It is the intention of this volume " to give an unceremonious introduc- 
tion of certain trees and shrubs *' to such as are " occasionally in the habit 
of meeting j;hem without being acquainted, in many instances, even with 
their names. Botanical language has been carefully avoided; for, although 
it would often have saved many words, it was considered that such terms 
would be intelligible only to botanists ; and that the botanist was precisely 
the last person to whom a description of common trees and shrubs would 
be likely to be of any use." After an eloquent introduction in praise of 
the subject, and illustrative of the beauty and utility of trees, an alphabeti- 
cal arrangement is commenced, and all the hardy trees and shrubs, com- 
monly met with in parks and gardens, described in general language, and 
treated of historically and poetically. In addition to the systematic name, 
is given the Linnean class and order, the order according to the natural 
system, and the synonyms in English, Scotch, French, and Italian. The 
biography (if the term may be so applied) of each tree and shrub is drawn 
from varied and authentic sources in different languages, and rendered 
more interesting than in any work which has hitherto appeared. The only 
alteration we could suggest in a second edition, would be the grouping of the 
species together, according to their natural orders, and a general alphabeti- 
cal index of all the names, scientific as well as synonymous. Many, how- 
ever, will prefer the book as it is ; and we can strongly recommend it as 
full of instructive and agreeable reading. It may be considered a suitable 
companion for the St/lvan Sketches of Mr. Strutt, a work equally delightful 
in its kind.

Few means will be found more effectual, for the general diffusion of a 
knowledge of natural history, than the establishment of provincial 
museums, libraries, and botanic gardens ; and the delivery of lectures and 
demonstrations in them. Viewing the subject in this light, it will readily be 
imagined that we are highly gratified with the present volume, which con- 
tains six lectures, read also to the Philosophical Society of Portsmouth (for 
an account of this and other natural history societies in Hampshire, see p. 190.), 
in complimentary return for a discourse on light and vision, read by one of 
the most distinguished members of that society, before the Institution of the 
Isle of Wight. The lectures are six ; one on vegetable physiology, which 
embraces a very extensive view of the subject, with a recapitulation in a 
tabular form ; one on zoology, as it appears to us, exceedingly well drawn 
up, and concluding with tabular views of the classifications of animals, by 
Cuvier and Blumenbach. There are two lectures on animal and vegetable 
poisons ; and one oh the human faculties, mental and corporeal. In his 
preface the author has the following remark: — "With respect to the 
utility of scientific associations, which are now extending themselves 
throughout the kingdom, we may be permitted to remark, that, as it has 
been deemed of importance to bestow the light of science on the labouring 
classes, it surely is still more essential that the middling ranks (upon whom 
the welfare of society so mainly depends) should also partake of its bene- 
ficial influence ; and we are not aware of any pursuit more calculated to 
enlarge their minds, and to lay the foundation for useful knowledge, than 
the contemplation of that subject which the societies above alluded to have 
principally in view ; namely, the works of the creation, the laws by which 
they are regulated, and the practical applications of which they are sus- 
ceptible."

Ellis's Work on Corals, with Additions. — The science of geolog}' is now 
generally acknowledged to be so dependent upon a right knowledge of the 
fossils which are to be found in the various strata composing the surface of 
the earth, that no one can be said to be well acquainted with it who has net 
some insight into their nature and habits. That branch of natural history 
which treats of shells has been most admirably illustrated by the Sowerbys ; 
but another branch exists, in which, much to the discredit of the scientific 
part of the nation, very little has been done : I allude to the corals that 
are to be found in a mineralized state. It appears that no work, treating 
expressly upon this important subject, is now extant in the English lan- 
guage but that of Ellis and Solander, which is only to be found in private 
libraries. But I perceive, by reference to Conybeare's Outlines of Geology, 
p. 213., that a Frenchman, Lamouroux, is stated to have republished Eliis*s 
work, with additions. Now, Mr. Editor, it would be very desirable, for 
the advancement of this branch of natural history, that this work should 
be known as extensively as possible ; and this object cannot be better at- 
tained than by your taking notice of it in the forthcomiog Number of the 
Magazine of Natural History. 

If there be any other works which treat on this important subject, either 
in the French or English language, you would be doing a great service to 
your country readers by giving some account of them. — William Battersly.

Technicalities of Science. — It is time that we should get rid of that 
puerility, which would persuade us that a fact, described in terms and language 
familiar only to the learned, becomes of less importance when displayed in 
the energetical simplicity of our mother-tongue. It is time that such puerility 
should be placed upon the shelf, or hurried to the tomb of all the Capulets. 
If, however for the sake of foreigners, such a course should at any time be 
deemed expedient, it is hoped, that in this journal, at any rate, an English 
translation will accompany the Latin description, so that it may escape the 
complaints frequently made, and with much truth, against many of the 
works on natural history, which have been published in this country and 
elsewhere, and which appear as if designed rather to display the learning 
of the writers, than to state the facts which such learning ought to convey. 
Such, however, it is admitted, is the effect of habit, or the pride of science, 
or both combined, that it is very often difficult for those accustomed to 
scientific language and terms, to condescend to the use of such as shall 
make what they write at once agreeable to, and understood by, the general 
reader. Through inattention to these circumstances, the study of natural 
history has not obtained that attention in this country to which it is enti- 
tled and deserves ; and I may venture to predict, that while the pride of 
science shall refuse to condescend to familiar explanation, the number of 
students in natural history will not veiy materially increase. However, it 
is to be hoped that the prospects of natural history are extending, and that 
the establishment of the Zoological Society in particular will excite the 
public attention ; that the study of nature will be more simplified, and be 
made more attractive and more amusing. The publication of the Maga- 
zine of Natural History will, it is also hoped, be instrumental in this work, 
by reducing the science to the level of ordinary capacities, and by smooth- 
ing the road to more recondite views. — James Jennings. London^ June 6.

White Cats with blue eyes alwam deaf. — Sir, The brief notice at p. 66.. 
of your intcfrpsting Magazine of Natural History, that " white cats with 
blue eyes are always deaf," induces me to forward to you the following con- 
firmation of that extraordinary fact, which has come within my own know- 
ledge. Some years ago a white cat of the Persian kind (probably not a 
thoroughbred one), procured from Lord Dudley's at Hindlev, was kept ia 
my family as a favourite. The animal was a female, quite white, and per- 
fectly deaf. She produced, at various times, many litters of kittens, of 
which, generally, some were quite white, others more or less mottled, 
tabby, &c. But the extraordinary circumstance is, that of the offspring 
produced at one and the same birth, such as, like the mother, were entirely

white, were, like her, invariably deaf; while those that had the least speck 
of colour on their fur, as invariably possessed the usual faculty of hearing.

Owls feed their young with Fish. — Probably it may not be generally 
known to naturalists, that the common brown owl (5trfx stridula) is in the 
habit, occasionally at least, of feeding its young with live fish ; a fact which 
I have ascertained beyond doubt. Some years since several young owls 
were taken from the nest, and placed in a yew tree in the rectory garden 
here; in this situation the parent birds repeatedly brought them live fish, 
bull-heads (Cottus G^obio) and loch (or loach, Cobites barbatula), which had 
doubtless been procured from the neighbouring brook, in which these 
species abound. Since the above period, 1 have, on more than one occa- 
sion, found the same fish, either whole or in fragments, lying under the 
trees on which I have observed the young owls to perch after they have 
left the nest, and where the old birds were accustomed to feed them. It 
has always been a wonder to me by what method the owl contrives to cap- 
ture the finny tribes, being apparently a bird peculiarly unfitted for piscatory 
depredations. If you, or any of your correspondents, better acquainted 
than myself with the manners and habits of the bird, should be able to 
solve the difficulty, I should be obliged by, their so doing. — Id. 

Owls feed on Fish. — This circumstance is mentioned in Jennings's Orni- 
thologia, and corroborates a declaration made by a labourer who was em- 
ployed to watch the fish-pond intheflower-gardenof Bulstrode,about 50years 
ago. The gold and silver fish had been missed ; the duchess (Margaret, grand- 
mother of the present Duke of Portland) being a lady of distinguished taste 
for every curious object of natural history, suspecting that the pond had 
been poached, ordered Mr. Agnew, the gardener, to employ men to watch. 
The watchmen detected the robbers, whom they saw alight on the side of 
the pond, and there waiting the approach of the fish, captured and devoured 
them ! The common brown owls were the robbers, at least so the men 
reported ; but they were not generally credited. One of the men, Joseph 
Newman, who reported the above circumstances, still attests the fact. —

The Golden-crested Wren may be taken, by striking the bough upon which 
it is sitting, sharply, with a stone or stick. The timid bird immediately 
drops to the ground, and generally dead. As their skins are tender, those 
who want them for stuffing will find this preferable to using the gun. 
White remarks, in his Natural History of Selborne, " that the golden-crested 
wren (the smallest British bird) will stand unconcerned till you come within 
three or four yards of it." — JD. S. Bungay, March, 1828.

. Influence of Light on colounng the Leaves of Plants. — It frequently 
happens in America that clouds and rain obscure the atmosphere for several 
days together, and that, during this time, buds of entire forests expand' 
themselves into leaves. These leaves assume a pallid hue till the sun ap- 
pears, when, within the short period of six hours of a clear sky and bright 
sunshine, their colour is changed to a beautiful green. A writer in Silliman's" 
Journal mentions a forest on which the sun had not shone during twenty 
days. The leaves, during this period, had expanded to their full size, but 
were almost white. One forenoon the sun began to shine in full brightness.' 
" The colour of the forest absolutely changed so fast that we could perceive 
its progress. By the middle of the afternoon the whole of these extensive 
forests, many miles in length, presented their usual summer dress." {SilH-

being succeeded by mosses, and, on their decay by the smaller plants. A writer 
in the VeriUam observes, " even in cities this may be done by observing the 
successive steps by which the top of a brick wall, for example, becomes 
covered with vegetation. First, there i» the green incrustation, called Bys- 
sus by Linnaeus, but recently proved by our friend, Mr. Drummond, of the 
Cork botanic garden, to be the primary germination of several species of 
mosses, such as Polytricha and Tortulae. When this decays, a very thin 
stratum of vegetable earth is formed, which affords a scanty support for the 
roots of the next year*s crop of mosses, and in process of time soil is formed 
of a sufficient depth for Draba vdrna and other wall plants.*'

East Winds and BlightSy April 30. 1828. — In conversation with Mr. 
Gibbs of Brompton, he stated, that " we would certainly have an east wind 
about this time." The wind had veered to the east in the morning of this 
day, but at' the time we were speaking it had changed to the north-east. 
He added, however, that for twenty-two years he had paid particular atten- 
tion to this circumstance ; and, except twice, always observed that the wind 
blew from the eastward at the beginning of May. 

No one who has paid attention to the progress of vegetation in the vernal 
months, but can remember how often they have had to witness the wither- 
ing effects of the east wind on the tender plants, flowers, and shoots of this 
season : its parching effects on the garden, and its hurtful consequences to 
the young barley in the fields, are frequent complaints. These easterly 
winds, too, are frequently attended by a blue mist, called, by those living to 
the westward of the metropolis, " London smoke ;" and though it is well 
known, that the fuliginous vapour of this great city extends, like the train 
of a comet, to the distance of fifty miles, yet that blue mist or haze, which is 
known to be so extensive, cannot be occasioned by such a local circum- 
stance. But from the want of simultaneous meteorological observations at 
numerous distant stations, (a want which your Magazine is well de- 
signed to remove), we have not sufficient data on which to form'a rational 
opinion, as to the prevalence of either the east wind or the blue mist. 
The latter is called a blight, and many people imagine that the aphides 
are wafted through the air by this same mist ; because the depredations of 
these insects become visible at the time, or soon afterwards : but with such 
winds we have commonly a clear sky ; in course the sun's heat is intense, 
and this it is which brings forth the insects from every place where they 
were deposited in the previous autumn, and also instigates the pregnant 
females to bring forth their incalculable generations. 

With respect to the direction of the wind at this period, 1 can only offer 
an opinion which, I must own, rests on a very slender foundation. Having 
had some acquaintance with the trade-winds of intertropical latitudes, and, 
since my residence in England, having on many occasions been struck with 
similar appearances, accompanied by easterly winds, I naturally conjectured 
that such currents of air arose from the same cause, and that circumstances 
of the state of the air, and of the general face of Europe, might temporarily 
and occasionally produce those periodical winds observed by Mr. Gibbs.

An Eruption of Mount Vesuvius took place on the morning of the 2 2d 
of March last, which has been well described in the Athencsum for April 18th. 
A coiTespondent who was at Naples at the time thus writes : " The cone 
of the mountain puts you in mind of an immense piece of artillery, firing 
red hot stones and ashes and smoke into the atmosphere ; or, of a huge 
animal in pain, groaning, crying, and vomiting ; or like an immense whale 
in the arctic circle, blowing after it has been struck with several harpoons.'*

Art. II. Natural History in London, 

The British Museum. — Since the publication of Art. II., in theFirstNum- 
ber of your Magazine, which contained obseiTations on the collections of 
natural history in the British Museum, I was informed that considerable 
improvements had recently been made in some of the departments. I have, 
therefore, been induced to revisit the different rooms accessible to the pub- 
lic, and I think it but justice to state the results of my examination. 

Every Englishman with correct and honourable feelings, must wish to see 
the scientific institutions of his own country rival, if not excel, those of other 
nations. He will hail the successful labours of men of science in every 
department ; and, without stopping to enquire whether they belong to his 
own coterie, or are members of his own society, he will exclaim, 

" Je prends part a leur gloire, leur bonheur est le mien." 

I can truly say, it gave me much pleasure to observe that the spirit of 
improvement had visited the British Museum, and that some of the arrange- 
ments which had so long been left incomplete, were at length accomplished 
in a satisfactory manner. On the upper landing of the grand staircase, the 
giraffes present a very different appearance from that which I remember 

N 3 



182 Natural History in London. 

when I was last at the Museum. At that period there were only two of 
these animals ; and so little care was taken in stuffing the skins, that the 
legs resembled gate-posts more than the limbs of a beautiful quadruped. At 
present, due attention has been observed to preserve the just proportion and 
symmetry of the parts, and the three figures form an interesting group. I 
mention these objects, because their improved appearance m /iwi/je augured 
well for the improvements in other parts of the establishment. On entering 
the ante-room of the saloon, I was pleased to observe a large collection of 
fossil univalve shells, arranged in cases, which cover the centre of the room; 
these, however, have only been introduced very recently, to judge from the 
catalogue of 1827, in which they arc not in any way noticed. I shall revert 
to this collection again. The saloon contains a beautiful collection of simple 
minerals, a great part of which belonged to the Greville collection. Of this 
collection 1 have only to repeat what I stated in Ai-t. II., that " it is, 
perhaps, as well classed as the space allowed for it will admit of." More 
care, however, appears to be taken in placing labels ; and several new speci- 
mens have been added, particularly of meteoric stones, and meteoric native 
iron. The next room. No. 8., contains the collection of recent shells, in 26 
cases, well arranged, and conveniently displayed for inspection. The names 
of Lamarck are on one side, and those of Linnaeus (which are here more 
generally known) on the other. The collection may be regarded rather as 
a useful than a splendid one, compared even with private collections in this 
country ; among others might be particularised that of Dr. Goodall, Provost 
of Eton. On taking a general view of the whole, the reason did not appear 
very obvious why its arrangement should have Required so many years to 
complete. It is true, that the system of Lamarck was but imperfectly 
understood in England, even seven or eight years since ; but many natural- 
ists might have been found on the Continent, who would, with much ease, 
have arranged the collection in fewer weeks, than it has taken years to 
accomplish ; and a whole generation of young men havegrown up between the 
years 1810 and 1823, who might have profited by it, and been now adding 
to the stock of natural knowledge in various parts of the world. It is, 
however, useless to dwell upon the past ; it is more gratifying to observe, 
that there is now a well-arranged collection of recent shells in the British 
Museum, accessible to the public ; and young persons who visit London, and 
are desirous of cultivating this branch of natural history, may have an 
opportunity of improvement which few, if any, of our provincial towns 
present. 

" Si fas est doceii*^ if it be lawful for the curators of this collection 
to receive a hint, not ab hoste, but fiom a true friend to the scientific insti- 
tutions of his own country, he would suggest, that the collection might be 
made more instructive, by placing the name of each genus at full length, at 
the head of each compartment, where the species occu{)y more than one ; 
and, where two genera begin with the same letter, as Capsa and Crassina, 
instead of simply placing C, to add the first letters, and write Cap. Cras. ; 
because learners who are examining the shells, are frequently prevented 
from reverting to the generic words, by the company crowding round the 
cases. As conchology forms the amusement or the study of many ladies 
who neither read Greek, nor are familiar with the works of Cuvier or La- 
marck, a short explanation of the terms Gasteropoda, Cephalopoda, &c. 
would be useful. It would, at least, remind them, that the knowledge of 
the shell forms but a small part of the natural history of the MoUusca ; and 
that a knowledge of the structure of the animals, and of their modes of 
forming their shells, would be infinitely more curious and valuable could it 
be obtained. 

Let us now return to the fossil shells in the ante-room. These are chiefly 
univalve shells, from the tertiary formation of the Paris basin; but there is 
one great defect in the arrangement of these, and of all the other fossil

«hells in the Museum. They are placed without any reference whatever to 
their geological position, and the localities of the English fossil shells is 
seldom given. In the cases in the ante-room, the very important distinction 
of the marine and fresh- water shells is not made, nor is any information 
aiTorded whether the shells belong to the series of strata below the gypsum, 
or the series above. Thus, those persons who are not already acquainted 
with the fossil conchology of the different formations, will derive much less 
instruction from this collection, than they might do were the shells geolo- 
gically arranged. Indeed, fossil conchology, without a reierence to geology, 
is as useless, as the study of history would be, without any reference to geo- 
graphy and chronology. The want of geological arrangement is still more 
striking in the fossil collection placed in the room No. 9. The locality, or 
the name of the formation in which the}' were found, is not, I believe, given 
with any of the English fossil shells or zoophytes. On this account, the 
fossil conchology in the British Museum may be said to remain in a very 
defective state. 

Round the room No. 9., there are, however, numerous interesting speci- 
mens of vertebrated animals of the saurian or lizard family, and also of fossil 
fish ; the localities of the foreign specimens are annexed. There is also an 
interesting collection of fossil bones of the larger mammalia, and of the 
carnivorous animals found in caverns, and some fossil remains of birds ; 
these are all as well placed and arranged, as the form of the cases will 
admit of. 

The large room No. 10., is occupied with what is called, in the catalogue, 
** the rudiments of a collection of British simple mineral substances ; " but 
many of the cases, after a lapse of several years since the collection was 
began, are still empty, or nearly so. It is to be regretted that a large space 
is so injudiciously appropriated, in an establishment where room is much 
wanted. The minerals of each county are in separate cases, but there can 
be little utility in having specimens of common galena, calamine, &c. from 
all the counties in which they occur* ; to enumerate their localities in a 
catalogue would surely be sufficient. The waste of room is the more to 
be lamented, as there is at present no geological collection of rock specimens 
in the Museum, either illustrative of general geology, or the geology of our 
own country. A foreigner visiting the British Museum, might suppose that 
the science, and even the very name of geology, were unknown in England. 
In this respect, the former mineral collection was preferable to the present, 
as it contained illustrative specimens of the primary and transition rocks. 
There is ample space in the room No. 10., for specimens of each known 
species of simple minerals in England, and for the principal varieties; and 
also for a well-arranged collection of geological specimens, comprising the 
strata in all the formations in Great Britain. It would be difBcult to offer 
a satisfactory reason why such a collection is not placed there. 

The zoological collections in the British Museum may be briefly dis- 
missed. The whole collection of insects is contained in four small cases ; 
nor are these completely filled. The birds, and mammiferous quadrupeds, 
are arranged according to the orders of Linnaeus, but want of room prevents 
their being placed in situations sufficiently accessible for inspection. The 
species of quadrupeds are not numerous, owing, I believe, to the decay 
which too speedily takes place in stuffed specimens, particularly in the at- 
mosphere of London. From the liability to decay, the difficulty with which 
they are replaced, and the great space they occupy, stuffed specimens of 
quadrupeds might, perhaps, be conveniently dismissed from our collectionSj 

* The counties being artificial divisions, the minerals in adjacent counties 
are generally identical, or at least as much so as the same minerals from dif- 
ferent parts of the same county.

except of such rare animals as can seldom, if ever, be brought alive to Eu- 
rope. Skeletons, exhibiting the structure and distinctive characters of the 
orders and genera, accompanied with correct coloured drawings of the species, 
arranged in frames, would be far more durable, and convey more scientific 
information than stuffed specimens ; they would occupy less space, and also 
be less expensive. 

A slight inspection of the rooms in the Museum, appropriated to natural 
history, will prove that the science has outgrown the space allotted for it. 

It is much to be desired that ample room may be found in the buildings 
now erecting, to exhibit properly the objects in every department of nature, 
and that our national museum may be placed on a par with the museums of 
natural history on the Continent. We may also be permitted to express a 
wish, that no unnecessary delay in completing the arrangements may be 
tolerated. It would add greatly to the utility of the collections, if, beside 
the general catalogue at present published, an ample systematic catalogue 
were also to be published, for the use of those who are commencing the 
regular study of natural history. 

Lhmean Society. — May 4. The]reading of Mr. Morgan's paper, on the 
mammary organs of the kangaroo, containing farther particulars of the dis- 
section of these parts, as well as of the muscles attached to the marsupial 
bones, in the adult and impregnated animal, was continued. These bones, 
with their ligamentous and muscular connections, were described, and seve- 
ral errors in Sir Everard Home's published account of these parts were 
pointed out. The author then stated his own opinions respecting the use 
of these structures. He stated that the marsupial bones are formed, first, 
for the purpose of giving that firm support to the superincumbent abdomi- 
nal viscera which the narrow pelvis of the animal is incapable of affording, 
while in the erect posture ; and, secondly, for the purpose of constituting a 
fixed point of resistance, against which the mammae are squeezed by the 
muscular girdle already described as enclosing those glands between their 
fibres. By this arrangement, the female is enabled to empty, by compression, 
the excretory ducts of its mammae, and thus to force their secretions into 
the mouth of the imperfectly organised young, which, during the earlier 
periods of its existence, appears incapable of extracting a nutritious fluid 
from that part, by the usual means. 

It appears that the secretion of this fluid (or milk) takes place only in the 
larger and lower gland, and that its ejection through the inferior and 
longer teat is assisted by a muscular investment, which incloses the ducts 
throughout their whole course, from the gland to the extremity of the 
nipple. The existence of this structure has been noticed by M. Geoffroy 
St. Hilaire, who has assigned to it the same use. Under this compressing 
muscle of the lower, or, as Mr. Morgan has named it, the true, marsupial 
teat, a congeries of vessels, which principally consisted of veins, was de- 
scribed as forming a plexus around the central fasciculus of ducts. These 
veins, together with those of the gland, were stated to occasion a consider- 
able distension of the mammary organ during the time of suckUng, in conse- 
quence of the congestion which must necessarily occur in the vessels at that 
period, from the pressure made upon their main trunks by the action of the 
compressing muscle of the mammae ; .for it has been found, that the size of 
the organ, on such occasions, exceeds that which a loaded state of the 
ducts only could produce. The mammae were found, as in the virgin ani- 
mal, to consist in double glands on each side, the upper and smaller pre- 
senting the sam-e anatomical characters as in the former instance ; its excre- 
tory ducts, however, in their course towards the upper nipple, were found 
to be enclosed in an indistinct muscular sheath, and there was a faint indi- 
cation of the existence of a plexus of vessels similar to that which was found 
in the lower or true marsupial teat. This smaller mammary organ is con- 
sidered by the author as analogous to the supernumerary mammae and teats 
of other mammiferous animals, since the lower, or true, marsupial mammary

glands and their teats, appear to perform, exclusively, the office of preparing 
a nutritious fluid for the support of the young animal. (^PMl. Mag. and

at which we write, is nearly 1000/. The subscription may either be in one 
principal sum, or so nmch per annum. Lord Stanley, the president, put

Geological Society, — April 18. A paper was read, " On the fossil re- 
mains of two new species of Mastodon, and of other vertebrated animals, 
found on the left bank of the Irawadi ; by William Clift, Esq. F.G.S. F.R.S., 
conservator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons.*' 

The author having been requested to describe the fossil remains which 
the zeal and liberality of Mr. Crawfurd have transferred from the deserts 
of the Irawadi to the museum of the Geological Society, confines himself 
strictly to zoological and anatomical details ; and, following the system of 
Cuvier, commences with the 

Pachydermata proboscidifera. The only genus of this order indicated by 
the remains is the Mastodon, and of this there are two species. Mastodon 
latidens and Mastodon elephantoides, not only commanding attention from 
their novelty, but from the beautiful gradation which they exhibit between 
the mastodons already described and the elephant. On comparing the teeth 
of Mastodon latidens with those of the mastodon of the Ohio (M. gigan- 
teum), the denticules are found to be more numerous and less distant, and 
the interstices less deep than in those of the latter ; the teeth, in short, 
begin to assume the appearance of those of the elephant. On advancing to 
Mastodon elephantoides, these features of similarity are more strongly de- 
veloped ; the many-pointed denticules are still more numerous and more 
compressed, and the structure, were it not for the absence of crusta petrosa, 
becomes almost that of the tooth of the elephant. In both, though the 
teeth are formed upon the principle by which the tooth of the mastodon is 
distinguished from that of the elephant, the crown of the tooth wears away 
more like that of the elephant than that of the other mastodons. 

Pachydermata ordindria. In this group we have the remains of the genera 
sus, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros. Of the first there is only a single 
specimen, consisting of a small portion of the lower jaw, containing one 
molar tooth, and the fragment of another ; of the second there are but 
few fragments, nor are they sufficiently characteristic to warrant a definition 
of the species, which must have been comparatively small ; of the third 
there is a portion of the upper jaw, containing two molar teeth, and por- 
tions of the lower jaw with molares, which seem to approach nearer to those 
of the Rhinoceros of Java than to those of any other living species. 



186 Natwal History in London^ 

Rumindnfia. In this group we have fragments of the ox and of the deer. 
Reptilia, Chelonia Cuv. (Testudinata BeU.) There are many fragments 
of a large species of trionyx, and some of an emys ; but the remains ar« 
not sufficiently defined for specific description. 

Sauria, fam. C'rocodilidae. Of this family we have the remains of two 
genera, viz. a Leptorhynchus, allied to, if not identical with, the great gavial, 
and a crocodile resembling Crocodilus vulgaris. Of the former there are 
portions of the lower jaw and several vertebrae; of the latter there is the 
anterior termination of the lower jaw, which must have belonged to a very 
large individual. 

The specimens, in general, do not appear to have undergone any mineral 
change, with the exception of being abundantly penetrated with iron, and 
are very brittle. This last circumstance, arising from the loss of their ani- 
mal gluten, indicates great antiquity, and that they have not been imbedded 
in any very compact soil ; unlike the teeth of the mastodon of the Ohio, 
which lie in a strong blue clay, and have almost as much animal matter as 
is to be found in a recent tooth. 

The bones are almost in every instance broken, and, from the firmness of 
texture of most of them, the direction and cleanness of the fracture, and 
the sharpness of its edges, the injury^ which must have been the result of an 
immense power operating with sudden violence, appears to have taken 
place at the period, or very soon after the period, of the destruction of the 
animal. 

A paper was next read, " On a collection of vegetable and animal re- 
mains, and rocks, from the Burmese country, presented to the Geological 
Society by J. Crawfurd, Esq.," by the Rev. W. Buckland, D.D. V.P.G.S. 
F.R.S. &c. 

Mr. Crawfurd collected these specipiens during his voyage up the Irawadi, 
in a steam-boat, on an embassy to Ava, in the latter part of the year 1826. 
The author considers them to be of high importance, as affording an answer 
to the curious and till now undecided question, whether there be, or be 
not, in the southern regions of Asia, any remains of fossil quadrupeds 
analogous to those which are found so widely dispersed in the diluvium of 
northern Asia, and of Europe and America. 

The evidence which Mr. Crawfurd has imported consists of several chests 
full of fossil wood and fossil bones, and of specimens of the strata that are 
found along the course of the Irawadi, from Prome up to Ava; being a dis- 
tance of nearly 500 miles. The greater part of the fossil wood is beautifully 
silicified ; other specimens of it are calcareous : they are mostly portions of 
large trees, both monocptyledonous and dicotyledonous, and were found 
along the whole valley erf the Irawadi from Ava to Prome. The bones were 
all collected from a small district near some wells of petroleum, about half 
way between these towns, and on the left bank of the river. From Mr. 
Clift'« examination, it appears that although we have among them no re- 
mains of fossil elephants, we have the same fossil Pachyd^rmata that are 
found associated with elephants in Europe, namely, rhinoceros, hippopo- 
tamus, mastodon, and hog. We have also two or three species of rumi- 
nantia resembling the ox, antelope, and deer, with the addition of the gavial 
and alligator, and two fresh-water tortoises, namely, trionyx and emys. 

The teeth of the mastodon belong to two unknown species of that genus, 
both of them approaching in size to the largest elephant. Mr. Clift has 
designated them by the names of Mdstodon Idtidens and M. fflephantoides. 
The teeth are from animals of all ages ; and there are many fragments of 
ivory, derived probably also from the mastodon. 

The remains of the mastodon are by far the most abundant in this col- 
lection, and amount to about 1 50 fragments. 

Of the rhinoceros there are about lo fragments; of a small species of 
hippopotamus, 2 ; of the hog, 1 ; of the ox, deer, and antelope about 



Natural History in Lottdon, 187 

90 ; of the gavial and alligator, about 50 ; of the emys, 20 ; and of the tri- 
onyx, 10. 

One fragment of emys is so large, that the animal of which it formed a 
part must have been several feet in width. 

The state of preservation of these bones is very perfect, from their being 
penetrated with hydrate of iron, and thereby rendered strong. Not one of 
them is silicified, though they have been erroneously stated to be so, in 
some of the periodical journals. 

The district in which they were found is a little north of the town of 
Wetmasut, and is composed of barren sand-hills and beds of gravel, inter- 
sected by ravines, and cemented occasionally into a breccia by carbonate of 
lime, and sometimes by hydrate of iron. Over the surface of these hills 
were scattered the fragments of bones and wood, some quite naked and 
loose, others half buried in the sand and gravel. Many fragments of wood 
lay also at the bottom of the ravines. About one third of the bones have 
been slightly rolled, and the rest had all been broken before they were 
lodged in the places where Mr. Crawfurd found them, and where they ap- 
pear to have been dispersed and buried by the action of the same waters 
that produced the diluvial sand and gravel ; whence they have since been 
washed out, and left bare by the action of rains and torrents. 

Concretions of sand and gravel adhere to many of the bones, but they 
contain no traces of shells, and differ mineralogically from all the rock 
specimens in this collection, which we recognize as belonging to tertiary and 
fresh-water strata. 

Indications of fresh-water formation were found in one spot only, not far 
from the fossil bones, and they consist of a marly blue clay, abounding with 
shells of a large and thick species of Cyrena. 

The tertiary rocks are, 1st. a dark slaty limestone, containing many shells, 
that have been identified by Mr. Sowerby with those of the London clay ; 
2d. a yellow sandy limestone, containing shells, and resembling the calcaire 
grossier ; and 3d. a soft greenish sandstone, resembling the sandy beds of 
our plastic clay formation. 

This London clay and calcaire grossier afford an additional locality of 
these strata to those indicated by the specimens described by Mr. Cole- 
brooke, in vol. i. part i. second series of the Geological Transactions^ which 
had already established the e^dstence of this formation in the north-east 
border of Bengal. 

Mr. Crawfurd states distinctly, that it is impossible to refer the situation 
of the bones, or the origin of the hills containing them, to any operations of 
the existing river. These hills are 60 ft. above the level of its highest flood. 
The effect of its actual operations, he observes also, is distinctly visible in 
the shifting islands of mud and sand that abound along the whole course of 
the river within this high-flood level, and in the great alluvial delta that 
extends from a little below Prome to Rangoon and the Gulf of Martaban. 
The recent bones and recent wood which he observed to be stranded on 
some of these islands, were not in a state of progress towards becoming 
mineralised, but were falling rapidly to decay. 

The existence of so many animal remains analogous to those that occur 
in the diluvium of Europe, in a matrix which so nearly resembles that dili- 
vium, and which so decidedly differs from the alluvium, and fresh-water, 
and tertiary strata of the adjacent country, seems to authorise us to refer 
this matrix to a similar diluvial deposit in the valley of the Irawadi, re- 
posing irregularly upon the tertiary and other stratified rocks, that form the 
basis of that district. 

Besides the tertiary strata above enumerated, there are specimens of 
grauwacke and transition limestone, from several distant points in the valley 
of the Irawadi between Prome and Ava, which render it probable that th« 
fundamental rocks of this valley belong to the transition series.

On the north of Ava there are chains of primitive mountains abounding 
with statuary marble, associated, as usual, with horn-blende and mica slate. 
We may, therefore, consider it as now established, on the authority of 
Mr. Crawfurd's notes and specimens, that the Burmese country not only 
contains the remains of fossil animals above enumerated, but also affords 
examples of the following geological formations, which can be identified 
with those of Europe, namely, 1. Alluvium; 2. Diluvium; 3. Fresh-water 
marl; 4. London clay and calcaire grossier; 5. Plastic clay, with its sands 
and gravel; 6. Transition limestone and grauwacke; 7. Primitive marble 
and mica slate.

Zoological Society. — Apiil 29. The anniversary meeting of the members 
of this society was held at the rooms of the Horticultural Society, the Mar- 
quess of Lansdowne, President, inthe chair. The meeting was numerously 
attended. The President congratulated the meeting on the continued pro- 
gress which the society had made during the past year, as well in the grjeat 
accession to their numbers, as in the development of their objects and the 
extension and improvement of their plans. He also suggested another topic 
of congratulation — the state of the finances. The secretary then reacl a 
report, by which it appeared the receipts during the last year exceeded 
5,000/., and that a balance of nearly 1,000/. remained in the banker's hands 
on the 1st of January. Since that period, upwards of one hundred and 
thirty additional members have joined the society, and the secretary an- 
nounced that several names were added on the morning of the meeting : 
among them were those oftheDuke of Wellington and theEarl of Harrowby. 
A list of animals in the garden of the Society was then read, and a present of 
four kangaroos, bred in this country, was announced, from the Marquess of 
. Hertford. Some regulations for the admission of members and visitors lo 
the museum and gardens were then proposed, and, after some discussion, 
adopted. According to these regulations, members have the right of entree 
to both establishments, at all times, with one or two friends ; and the pub- 
lic will, in the course of the season, have admission to the museum and 
gardens on three days in the week, on payment of 1*. each person. Mem- 
bers can also purchase a ticket, at the rate of one pound annually, which 
will admit two additional persons. These regulations will be modified by 
the council as circumstances may require. Five new members of the coun- 
cil ; viz. Hon. G. A. Ellis, M.P.; Thomas Hoblyn, Esq., F.R.S.; Earl of 
Mountcharles, M.P. ; S. Taylor, Esq., F.L.S., and Sir R. Vyvyan, Bart, 
were proposed and elected. The Marquess of Lansdowne was reelected 
President; andN. A. Vigors, Esq. Secretary. {Verulam.) 

May 14th. The council have thought it essential to the interests of 
the society, that the following regulations be adopted and strictly adhered 
to: — 

Every member shall have personal admission to the gardens and museum, 
with two companions. If accompanied by more than two, he shall pay 
one shilling for each extra person. 

A member, on payment of one guinea annually, may obtain an ivory 
ticket which will admit one named person with a companion to both csta^ 
blishments ; or a transferable ivory ticket which will admit one person. He 
may obtain two or more such tickets at the same rate. 

Any member who may find it inconvenient to attend personally at thp 
gardens or museum, may, upon application to the council, have his privi- 
leges transferred, within the present year, to any individual of his family, 
whom he may name. 

Every member will be expected to give his name on entering the garden 
and museum. k 



Natural History i7i London, 189 

The gardens will be open to members from eight o'clock, A.M. ; but they 
will be in complete readiness for the reception of visitors only from ten 
o'clock to sunset. The museum will be open from ten o'clock to six. ^ 

We cannot but regret that a liberal institution should have been obliged 
to resort to admission money ; so many regulations, too, are bad on the face 
of them. If accompanied by more than two, it will not be the value of the 
** one shilling for each extra person " that will be the most painful, but a 
sense of restraint, more easily conceived than expressed, and amounting al- 
most to a feeling of degradation. Then the purchase of " ivory tickets," by 
those who can afford them, at once makes two classes, and consequently 
ranks of those who ought to be one, and, as members of the society, on a 
perfect footing of equdity. We should have thought the feeling produced 
m the Horticultural Society, by the creation of different ranks and privi- 
leges would have operated as a warning intthis case. Our opinion is, that 
in all literary or scientific societies, it shuld never be in the power of 
wealth or hereditary rank, as such, to procure any advantage over the poorest 
member of such societies. But perhaps our opinion is erroneous, and we 
are quite willing to listen to that of others. Instead of the first five of the 
above regulations, we would allow every member to give as many admis- 
sion tickets as he chose, and we should say, that the more he gave, the 
more would the objects of the society be promoted : or, if money is to be 
taken at the door, let it be taken from those who present themselves. —

Medico-Botanical Society. — May 9. Several books, and a variety of 
rare plants were presented, and two papers read. On the Haimarada of 
Demerara, Vandellia diffiisa Lin. Scrophularineae {Jig. 82.), by Dr. John 
Hancock of Demerara. This humble 
plant, which grows on the road-sides 
m Guiana is, by the Dutch Creoles, 
called " Bitter Blairr," and is an- 
nounced by the author as most effi- 
cacious in several diseases of the na- 
tives, but more particularly intermit- 
tent fevers. A paper on the Bushmen 
of the Orange River, and their poi- 
soned arrows, by Mr. Louis Leslie, 
assistant surgeon of the 48th regi- 
ment, and communicated to the So- 
ciety by Sir James M*Grigor, Presi- 
dent, was also read. The author, who was stationed on the banks of the 
Orange River, South Africa, before the post was abandoned, after giving a 
short description of the appearance of these miserable beings, who are said 
by him to live on locusts, ants, and some farinaceous roots, states, that he 
has not been able to procure one authenticated relation of death in man 
from the effects of the arrows employed by the Bushmen in self-defence 
Mr. Frost, the director, delivered some extemporary observations in very 
good style on the plants, chiefly from the hot-house and green-house, fur- 
nished by our neighbour Mr. Campbell from the Bayswater botanic garden. 

Zoological Imposture. — A female bear, shaven, and dressed as a woman, 
is now exhibiting in a caravan in the Borough, as a monstrosity of the 
human species from the deserts of Arabia. The animal is placed in an arm- 
chair, and tightly but concealedly strapped to it, so as to assume the 
appearance of a human figure in a sitting position. The skin of the hands 
and feet, besides being closely shaved, is artificially coloured. — J^R,

The Portsmouth Philosophical Society owes its existence to the meetings 
of a few scientific individuals, for the purposes of experimental philosophy, 
in the year 1815, whose numbers being increased in 1818, they fornied a 
Society, published a code of laws, and elected a president; and in 1821 
published their first annual report. Their rooms are in Pembroke Street, 
where they have a theatre for the delivery of public lectures, capable of 
accommodating three hundred persons, and a spacious museum. This col- 
lection was commenced in 1822, but it was not till 1824 that the addition 
of nearly two thousand specimens, and the introduction of lectures pn 
natural history directed the particular attention of the members to this 
department, from which period ,it has continued rapidly to increase, and 
now contains more than nine thousand specimens in natural history, con^ 
sisting of a few quadrupeds, about two hundred birds, reptiles dried and in 
spirits, fishes, insects more than one thousand, a series of Crustacea, mol- 
lusca dried and in spirits, shells about three thousand, a variety of zoophyta, 
several hundred mmerals and geological specimens, about one thousand 
five hundred fossil organic remains, amongst them a complete series of the 
Hordwell fossils figured by Branden. In botany a Flora A^rctica, a Hortus 
Siccus of Mont Blanc, the Filices of Jamaica, a Cryptogamia of Newfound- 
land, the British Cryptogamia of the late Mr. Hay, collected during a long 
life, with particular attention to the subject, the rudiments of a British and 
General Herbarium, &c. A considerable number of coins, and a great 
variety of miscellaneous objects of curiosity ; the whole arranged in glass 
cases, well suited for preservation and display. In the same room is the 
Society's extensive and valuable philosophical apparatus. 

In this museum the following points are particularly attended to : the 
preparation and preservation of every specimen in the best possible condi- 
tion ; the systematic classification of the subjects, so as to present every aid 
to the student which the smallness of the collection will admit. The 
acquirements of all local specimens, affording to the scientific tourist, at one 
view, the productions of the district. The present arrangement is mostly 
Linnean. Lectures on natural history form a part of the proceedings of 
the Society, and the following courses have been delivered since the esta- 
blishment of the museum : — On the Study of Natural History; the Classi- 
fication of the Animal Kingdom ; Ornithology ; Entomology ; Conchology ; 
the Moll6sca ; the Zoophyta ; the burrowing and boinng Marine Testacea ; 
Habits; &c. of certain ^Testacea ; the Vegetable Kingdom ; Anatomy and 
Physiology of Plants ; Mineralogy ; Oryctology (oryktos, fossil, logos, dis- 
course); Geology of the Island of Portsea ; the Chalk Formation ; Animal, 
Vegetable, and Mineral Poisons, &c.; besides a variety of illustrations of 
donations, short papers, notices, and discussions on subjects connected with 
natural history. 

. The freest admission is at all times obtainable to view the museum ; the 
curator is always ready to give every information relative to the coUejition, 
and impart to friends going to foreign parts the best methods of collecting 
and preparing objects in every department. By far the greater portion of 
the specimens have been presented by the members and their friends, and 
the great interest taken by them in its prosperity, together with its local 
advantages, present every prospect of its becoming both creditable to the 
institution and respectable as a provincial collection. Accompanying this 
communication is a copy of the laws and regulations of the Society, and a 
report of its state for 1826-7. — J. H. D. June, 1828.

history, antiquities, &c. From its isolated situation its progress has been 
comparatively slow, and from the same cause its members are but few in 
number, though possessing a very considerable share of talent. A course

The Philosophical Society of Southampton, established at the commence- 
ment of the present year (1828) on principles similar to that of Portsmouth, 
has commenced the formation of a museum, and acquired a considerable 
number of specimens, principally by way of deposit. From the emulation 
excited amongst the scientific individuals of that neighbourhood its speedy 
accumulation may be anticipated. — Id. 

Museum of the Royal Naval Hospital, Hasler. — In the left wing of this 
noble edifice the commissioners of His Majesty's victualling department 
have lately erected two elegant rooms ; the lower, superbly fitted up with 
mahogany cases, commodious seats, &c. as a library and lecture-room for 
the delivery of lectures to the medical pupils; the upper, finished in the 
most costly style of Grecian design, for the reception of a museum; tlie 
table, and upright cases, being of solid mahogany with brass ornaments, and 
the whole arrangement strikingly tasteful. It already contains many curious 
specimens in morbid anatomy, and a considerable number of foreign birds, 
insects, shells, minerals, plants, &c. principally presented by the medical 
officers of His Majesty's navy. From the peculiar advantages possessed 
by this museum, and the professional acquirements of its directors and sup- 
porters, it may be expected to become particularly rich and valuable in 
morbid and comparative anatomy, as well as highly interesting as a general 
collection. — Id. 

We are extremely obliged by these notices, and hope other readers and 
friends will follow the example. We should like not only to have accounts 
of the museums of natural history in every town and county in the empire,

instructive to many of your country readers. — H. J. Brown, Dorchester,

its colour, according to the colour of the substance it is near or in front of; 
but it takes hours to effect the change. I wish the notice had been drawn 
up in Mr. Neill's late housekeeper's time ; her name was Peggy Oliver ; she 
was housekeeper, cook, and gardener, and, since her death, he has got two

supply her place. Dear Sir, yours, very truly,— S. R. A. Edinburgh, May.

The Belfast Natural History Society held their anniversary meeting on 
the 24th of May. The report of the curator of the museum was read by the 
president, Dr. James L. Drummond, by which it appears that the number of 
members, which was last year 67, is now 85; that considerable additions 
have been made to the museum, by purchase, by exchange, and by dona- 
tion, and that a portion of the funds has been devoted to the library. 

" During the last year, the meetings of the Society were uninterrupted, 
and a great variety of papers were read ; many of these were continuations 
of subjects formerly commenced. It is to be remarked, that members are 
beginning to confine themselves more to particular branches of natural his- 
tory, thus giving to the others the advantage of a regular series of papers. 
In this way, mineralogy has been fully treated of, especially by one gentle- 
man, Mr. James M'Adam. Entomology has its own admirers. Some indi- 
viduals have devoted themselves to ornithology, and the first of a series of 
lectures on conchology was delivered on our last night of meeting. The 
total number of papers read during the session, is 30 ; twelve of these were 
on mineralogy, five on botany, one on topography, two on meteorology, and 
ten on the various branches of zoology. 

" For the purpose of directing to this Society the attention of our coun- 
trymen abroad, we have drawn up a circular letter, containing directions 
for the preservation of objects of natural history, and at the same time re- 
questing their co-operation in furtherance of our views, by sending such spe- 
cimens connected with our pursuit, as occur in their respective places of 
abode. In this way much might be done, as there are few persons who have 
it not in their power to contribute something to a museum ; and the mem- 
bers feel they can make a request of this kind without hesitation, as they 
have no individual right of property in a museum intended solely for the 
promotion of natural science in this part of Ireland.'* 

The address of the president. Dr. J. L. Drummond, contains a short ana- 
lysis of the principal papers read, and an eloquent and interesting address 
on the study of natural history, which, as we have been favoured with a 
copy, we intend giving in our next Number. Speaking of the M^zine of 
Natural History, the president observes, " I hope to see many of its future 
pages occupied with communications from this Society" — a hope which, 
we are sure, all our readers will earnestly desire to see fulfilled, and for the 
expression of which we are sure they will join with us in thanking the pre- 
sident and the society. — Cond.

The Weather^ from the beginning of May to this time, has been a conti- 
nuation of that we have had ever since the commencement of the year. 
Changeableness has been its general character. Dry and wet days have 
succeeded each other ; showers and sunshine occurred several times on the 
same day. Easterly and northerly winds prevailed during the first two 
weeks of May ; but frequently shifting to the opposite points, were, on such 
change, always accompanied with rain. Thunder-showers have been fre- 
quent, and sometimes very heavy, with hail, and sometimes followed by 
night-frosts. Travellers over extensive tracts of the kingdom have been 
struck with the appearance of drenched ground in one district, and annoyed 
by the dust flying on the roads in another, at no great distance. The quan-

tity of rain which has fallen during all this period has been but little more 
than the waste by evaporation ; and though some of the operations in the 
fields have been retarded by the frequent showers, it was not till the 4th 
'inst. that garden ground received a sufficient share of moisture to reach the 
roots. ^ For these two or three days last past, the wind has remained pretty 
steady in the N.W. ; should it not veer to the southward again, a dry season 
may follow, and give opportunity to make and secure the generally abun- 
dant crops of hay. — J. M. Chelsea^ 15th June, 1828. 



Art. VIII. Indicatorial Calendar* 

Numberless are the objects which attract our attention at this season, 
in the animal and vegetable world. The garden, the fields, the woods, and 
waters, all teem with organised life. Many of the fruits of the earth have 
arrived at, and many more are in progress, to perfection. 

Animals of the Chase have now a respite from their foes ; the crops on the 
fields prevent pursuit. On the grassy margins of fields, however, hares are 
often seen, at dawn or twilight, limping and frisking about with all their 
characteristic playfulness. At the same hours, rabbits issue from their bur- 
rows. Foxes, polecats, stoats, weasels, prowl about during the night ; and 
two or three species of the winged individuals of this class, viz., the bats, are 
seen on evenings, wheeling about and seizing their prey, the nocturnal 
moths. 

Of Birds, the young of all sorts are seen. The love-song of the greater 
number is nearly over, except such as breed late. Rooks are congregated, 
and, joined by the jackdaw, find their food on open fields or downs ; retiring 
to their roosting-places in high woods, on the approach of night. If the 
weather proves dry, so that their natural food (grubs) descend into the 
ground beyond their reach, they will sometimes betake themselves to fields 
pf corn, where they will do much damage, if not scared away in time. If 
a late brood or two are hatched after the rest, these do not, for some time, 
associate with the general company, but are led about by the old ones to 
cherry-orchards, and are often greater plagues to the orchardist than the 
whole rookery together. Coveys of partridges are often met with ; and if 
before the young can fly, they instantly squat motionless; and it is amusing 
to see the old ones' pretended helplessness in awkwardly fluttering away, to 
beguile the intruder from the place ; and with what address she steals in a 
circuit round, to call her young from the too-public spot. The sparrow- 
hawk is often seen rapidly skirting the hedge, or skimming the fields in 
quest of young birds; soon as observed, the swallow gives his shrill signal- 
note of danger, in which he is joined by the blue titmouse and some other 
birds. The swallow, house-martin, and wagtail, pursue the hawk with 
threatening cries, secure in their superior power of flight ; all others escaping, 
with cries of alarm, to thickets for safety. Small birds are not alarmed in 
the same way by the larger kind of hawks. The crow and magpie sound an 
alarm on sight of the falcon, buzzard, kite, and raven ; the three last fly 
before the audacious crow, but he rarely approaches near the first. The 
cuckoo, and chief of the migratory birds, are now nearly mute, and begin to 
steal away imperceptibly. The swift or black martin, almost always on 
wing round their place of resort, generally leave about the 8th of August ; 
kooner if the season is cold and wet, but seldom later if the weather be 
never so warm. The sky and wood-larks, with, here and there, a blackbird 
and song-thrush, are our principal songsters. The notes of other birds are 
only calls of fear or invitation to each other. 



Indicatorlal Calendar, 195 

Fishes, — The finny inhabitants of rivers and lakes may be seen variously 
employed, watching their prey, basking in the sunshine, or roving about in 
shoals. The springing trout rises in the air to catch the passing fly, and the 
voracious pike darts like an arrow from his lurking-place, among the heed- 
less fry of minor fish. Of these and sea-fish, the following are in season for 
the next two months : viz. 

Salmon, iSalmo »S^lar L. Gurnard, Trigla cuculus L. 

Salmon-trout, S. trutta L. Sturgeon, ^cipenser stiirio L. 

Trout, S. ii^ario L. Whiting, Gadus merlangus L.

Mullet, ilf^uUus Surmuletus i. With other common fresh-water 

Mackerel, ^Scomber *S'c6mber, L.' fish. 

Of Crustacea, the lobster, crab, crawfish, prawn, and shrimps, are brought 
to market, with two or three sorts of buccineum. 

The Insect tribes, which at this time sport in the sunbeam, visit the 
flowers and tender leaves, or crawl on the surface of the ground, are in- 
numerable. By day, the gaudy butterflies add life and variety of colour^ 
even to the parterre. Among them the following are the most conspicuous :¦ — 
The swallow-tailed Papilio Machaow, Peacock, Grand Admiral, Orange-tip, 
Marble, Tortoise-shell, Blue Argus. 

By night, the no less splendid family of moths are on wing, but can only 
be admired when they happen to be disturbed from their retreats by 
day. The elephant-hawk-moth is a beautiful type of the sphinx family. 
Beetles, in their metallic-coloured mail, are seen on flowers, on foliage, or 
on our paths. The stag, tree, hoary, and rose beetles, are met with in gar- 
dens; and the variously-marked lady-birds are everywhere, if the green 
aphides are prevalent. The splendid green cicindella flits before us on dry 
paths; and many others of this curious tribe. Of the family of bees all are 
in full enjoyment at this time ; the mason-bee is one of the most curious ; 
unlikesome of its congeners,its abode is solitary ; the habitation built by itself 
appears like a patch of mud stuck into a small hollow, on the face of a 
wall. Within this are chambers, lined with leaves, and containing one eggy 
which, becoming a maggot, lives on the store provided by the mother, 
changes to a chrysalis, and comes forth a perfect insect in the follow- 
ing spring. The dragon-flies are also an interesting tribe of insects ; their 
four transparent and ample wings, their lengthened, slender shape, and 
curious mailed structure and colours, and their habits of hovering over 
ponds and banks of rivers, where they are bred, sufficiently point them out 
to the notice of the naturalist. The 'krgest of the genus known in this 
country is the Libellula grandis. This magnificent insect may be often 
observed in shady walks or lanes, darting with astonishing velocity after 
every fly that passes, and on which he preys. The house-fly (Musca dom^s- 
tica) does not enter houses till the wet or cold of autumn drives them in ; 
but there is another fly which, exteriorly, much resembles it, and which is 
often troublesome in the ensuing months ; this is the Stomoxys calcitrans, 
©r stinging fly, one of the greatest plagues to cattle, as well as to persons 
wearing thin stockings. The invisible harvest bug (A'carus i^icinus), the 
common ghat, and musquito, are also troublesome to those whose delicate 
skin may be exposed to their unsuspected attack. Young frogs change 
from their tadpole state. 

The Vegetable Kingdom is now in full developement; the ripening corn, 
and the fertile fruit-trees bending under their swelling burthens, are, toge- 
ther, the effects and the reward of industry, and the offspring of the by- 
gone months. The garden glows with all the tribe of annual flowers ; a few 
perennials still adorn the flower-borders, which need not here be named*

(Agrost^mma Githago), the foxglove (Digitalis purpurea), bluewort (Cen- 
taurea Cyanus), frog*s-raouth (Antirrhinum Linaria), and several others appear. 
The marshes and meadows yield the Carduus pahistris, the CEuknihe pimpi-

umbellatus, and ^umex maritimus. Near woods may be seen, the ^yp^ri-

covering of ericas, ferns, &c. may be seen the Campanula rapunculoides, 
Campanula rotundifolia, and many less conspicuous. 

As changeable weather has continued ever since the beginning of the 
year, it is probable that at midsummer it may become more settled.

lar, or even greater, instance of superstition in this neighbourhood, viz. that 
in the event of the death of any of the family, it is necessary to inform the

A Natural History Conversazione, — Sir, Your correspondent J. W. of 
Cambridge has informed us, that Professor Henslow holds a natural history 
party every Friday evening. If information could be obtained through the 
medium of the Magazine of Natural History, as to the manner in which 
subjects are introduced and discussed at this or any other similar meeting, 
we in the country might be enabled to imitate, at humble distance, these 
pleasing conversaziones ; and you would merit the thanks of many ama- 
teurs of the science, and particularly of yours, — An Admirer of Nature. 
Ipswich, June 5. 1828. 

All that is necessary is, the time and place being fixed on, to lay on the 
table a few remarkable objects in natural history, specimens of animals, 
vegetables, or minerals, and a few good books on the subject, and especially 
books of plates. Serve tea and coffee of the first quality, and these will 
promote the conversation that will naturally arise among the individuals 
present on the subjects before them. — Cond. 

The common Rose-wood of Cabinet-makers (in answer to the Rev. G. M., 
of Lynn) is the root of the Conv61vulus «coparius, common in the Canary 
Islands, in Rhodes, and Cyprus. There is also a rose-wood sent from Ja- 
maica, which is the timber of the Amyiis elemifera; and, from the Antilles, 
the timber of Ehretta fruticosa, and from Cayenne, that of Licaria guian^n- 
sis, is also sent under the name of rose-wood. (Die. Class, lyHist. Nat.

Forming an Herbarium. — There are so many different ways of forming an 
herbarium, that one is quite at a loss which to pursue : you would confer a 
great obligation on many of your readers, by giving particular directions for 
the purpose. — The Rev. George Afunford. Lynn Regis, Norfolk, May 22. 



Qiicries a?id A?is'we7'S, 197 

1828. Till some correspondent favours us with more particular directions, 
we recommend the specimens to be dried between leaves of paper, under 
the pressure of a bag of sand or small shot, and, when perfectly dry, trans- 
ferred to a bound specimen-book, and sewed (not gummed) to its leaves, in 
the order of gathering the specimens. The name should be attached to each 
specimen by a slip of paper. In the course of three or four years, two or 
three thousand specimens will have been dried, and these may then be trans- 
ferred to another book or books, arranged according to the natural system, 
gummed on, and their names, &c. written beside them. The mode of form- 
ing the book for this purpose is as follows : — Suppose the size to be folio ; 
then gum the specimens on one side of leaves of drawing cartridge-paper, 
paste a leaf of reddish-brown blotting-paper on the back of the leaf contain- 
ing the specimens, and paste a margin of cartridge-paper all round both 
sides of each leaf, say half an inch broad at top and bottom, and the outer 
edge, and 1 in. broad at the inner or binding edge. This being done, put 
each leaf separately in a press, and let it remain there till it is pressed quite 
flat. Proceed in the same way with as many separate leaves as will contain 
all the specimens to be arranged, or as many as will make a proper sized 
volume; and then send them to a binder, to be bound in the usual way. 
The effect of the double edge will be, that each page of specimens will, as it 
were, lie fastened to the bottom of a shallow drawer, completely excluded 
from the air ; and the volume may be kept in a book-case along with others, 
in the usual way, and, by its index, referred to with as much ease as any 
other botanical work. This is by far the best method of keeping specimens 
that we know of, for small collections ; and we would strongly recommend 
all those who can afford it, to employ Professor La Gasca {Gard. Mag., 
Vol.11, p. 220), to form books of this sort, containing one or two species 
under each order and tribe of the natural system. There could not be 
purchased a work of equal value to the young botanist. Mr. Toward, 
flower-gardener to the Duchess of Gloucester, is the only person that we 
know of who possesses an herbarium done up in this way, and to him belongs 
the merit of the invention. The binder was Mr. Perryman, of Windsor, 
himself much attached to botany. (See Gard. Mag. for August, 1827.) —

How to commence the Study of Botany > — A young man, desirous of com- 
mencing the study of botany, would feel extremely obliged by a few re- 
marks on the most efficient mode of commencing the study, so as to make 
gradual proficiency without the assistance of a teacher ; he being so situ- 
ated as to preclude the possibility of obtaining verbal instruction. What 
books should he obtain ? and how may he obtain a correct knowledge of 
the technical terms used in the science ? A few remarks by yourself, or a 
correspondent desirous of being useful to the young student, would confer 
an obligation on, Sir, &c. — An Admirer of Nature. Bingwood, May 10. 
1828. 

Drummond's First Steps to Botany ^ London, 12mo, 2d edit., 200 figs., 9s., 
we consider the best book to commence with ; and next Smith's Intro- 
duction, and Hooker's Flora Scotica, or perhaps the forthcoming edition of 
Hull's Flora Anglica^ may be resorted to. While these books are studied, 
as many specimens of plants should be gathered and dried as possible, and 
their names ascertained from the nearest gardener. There is but little to 
be done in the study of botany without first storing the memory with the 
names and images of a number of plants of common occurrence. By 
gathering specimens (if only a single leaf of each plant), laying them between 
the leaves of a book of any sort, one on each page, and writing their names 
beside them, and afterwards turning them over two or three times a day, 
the names and images of all the plants of a garden or neighbourhood may 
be fixed in the memory in the course of a week or two. When this has 
been done, the student may turn to Hooker or Hull, and compare the de- 



198 Metrospective Criticism, 

scriptions there with the specimens. This will teach him the application 
of technical terms, and he may afterwards be able to discover the name of 
any plant by finding out its class and order, generic and specific distinctions.

The Lemming or Scandinavian Rat, Mm L^mmus Lin., Carapagnol (c«w- 
pana, a bell ; bones of the head in that form ?) Lemming Cuv., which, after 
a wet season, is known to descend in myriads from the great mountains in 
the north, and to deluge the adjacent plains, as it is supposed, in its way to 
the sea, proceeds, as naturalists inform us, in so straight a line, that no ob- 
ject is capable of turning it out of its way, and that, sooner than alter its 
course, it is known to prefer even death itself. If, as they inform us, this 
curious creature happens to find a large fire or a deep well in its way, in- 
stead of going round either of them, in the one instance, it boldly darts 
through the flames, and, in the other, resolutely proceeds down one side 
and up the other; in both cases, in imminent danger to itself. Similar 
phenomena are related, though not to such an extent, of the Bahama 
lobster ; and naturalists seem to rest content by informing us that these 
creatures obey, in this manner, some extraordinary impulse, or some won- 
derful law of nature, from which it is impossible for them to diverge ; but 
yet they seem to have made no inquiry as to why such should be the case. 
Animals, as well as mankind, migrate for various reasons, but most generally 
to obtain a better home than the one they already possess ; but in the case 
of the particular animals of which I have spoken, it is their persistency in 
a straight line which is so truly astonishing. Do you think, Mr. Editor, 
that this phenomenon can have any thing to do with optics, and that their 
eye being so constructed as to hinder them from seeing in any other than a 
direct line, may not impel them to pursue their route in the manner they 
do? — C. May, 1828. 

The Foul Water of Fishermen. — The St. Ives fishermen took but few 
mackerel last week ; they have met with large spots of what is called " foul 
water " in the fishing ground, from five to ten leagues off the coast. The 
nets, when in this water, which frequently extends to a considerable dis- 
tance, are covered with a glutinous and exceedingly offensive substance, 
from which it is found difficult to cleanse them. {Exeter Alfred, May 29.) 
What can this be ? Is it any excrementitious discharge from the shoals of

Standard of Colours. — Speaking of colours, it really would be important 
to naturalists and artists if a standard diagram of colours were established, 
(and, if you please, deposit it in the Tower with weights and measures). 
The original should be in stone, and authenticated copies may be issued in 
metallic colours. Thus any tint could be referred to by number or name. 
You are nearer to the useful Secretary than myself, and should ask Mr. Peel 
to add it to his list of desirables. — B. M. Bromsgrovej March 3. 1828. 



Art. X. Retrospective Criticism, 

The late James Sowerby, Esq., F.L.S. the projector, draughtsman, en-, 
graver, and in part author of the " English Flora." — Sir, On reading the 
memoir of the late Sir James Smith in your Magazine of Natural History 
(p. 91.), I perceive that one of the works of which he is stated to be the 
author (viz. English Botany) is so mentioned as to give the whole merit of 
that laborious work to this distinguished botanist. There can be no doubt 
that Sir James, bv his great talents, is entitled to the warmest praise of his 
countrymen ; still it is but justice to those who have prosecuted with equal 
zeal the study of nature, that the late Mr. James Sowerby's name should be 



Retrospective Criticism. 19!) 

stated as the' projector of that great and useful work, and that Sir James 
was employed to furnish the descriptions of the plants ; it being found by 
Mr. .Sowerby (after writing a part of the first vokime himself) that to make 
drawings, and engrave all the native plants of the British empire, was as 
much as he could expect to attain in a reasonable period ; and the accom- 
pHshment of the work fully proved that it required the persevering industry 
of twenty years for its completion. 

Perhaps I ought to apologise for occupying your time with that which 
may be generally known among your scientific readers ; still, as many per- 
sons will be induced to peruse a publication which presents the works of 
nature in so pleasing a manner, but who may be unacquainted with English 
botany, I have taken the liberty of bringing this subject to your remem- 
brance, that you may give it publicity in your pages, should you feel so 
disposed, in order that the great merits of the late Mr. Sowerby may not 
be overlooked, while we are paying homage to the distinguished talents of 
Sir James Smith. I am, Sir, &c. — B. LondoUy May 14. 1828. 

To be aware of the extraordinary talents and great Jndustry of the late 
Mr. Sowerby, and of the present family of this name, we have only to 
imagine the works on natural history published in Britain during the last 
fifty years deprived of their graphic illustrations. There is scarcely a 
botanical or zoological work of the present day which does not depend 
principally on this family for its most attractive features: none is more 
indebted to it than this Magazine, — Cond. 

U More loveable than wise. — My dear Sir, We all know how common it 
is for a long argument to end in both parties discovering that they had been 
of the same opinion from the first, and the difference had arisen from the 
use of some inappropriate term, or from a different conception of certain 
words. A. observes that his friend B. is a very pleasant old gentleman. 
" Not so oldy neither," replies B., senior; " you are greatly mistaken there." 
Both parties have precisely the same idea of the number of years B. has 
lived ; but the father and son have different notions of the word old. So, 
it is very probable that I differ in words only with your correspondent Con- 
chilla. " Of the two," says this lady, " I would have my fair countrywomen 
loveable rather than ivise.'" As this is a matter in which the whole sex are 
concerned, I must beg leave to protest against setting loveability in opposi* 
tion to wisdom. The happiness of a woman is so much in the power of her 
affections, that to be loveable is of the first importance to her. I am fap 
from undervaluing the greatest of all charms — this charm composed of a 
thousand others, each adding lustre to the rest j on the contrary, I object 
that Conchilla does it less than justice, in depriving it of that by which it 
chiefly exists. Surely, she who is most wise, will be likely to be the most 
loveable. A very silly woman is seldom very attractive ; and a truly love- 
able one, however mediocre or uncultivated her understanding may be 
considered, can scarcely be destitute of wisdom. There are some women, 
whose natural sweetness is such, that they seem, as a friend once observed 
to me, to have attained the result of wisdom, without going through the 
process. Sweetness of temper, alone, is an attraction truly loveable ; and h 
not sweetness of temper an intuitive wisdom ? Yet, in proportion as she is 
wise, how many attaching qualities may unite with sweetness of temper, to 
yender a woman loveable ! 

It has been observed to me, that the word learned would have been better 
than wise ; and, had the phrase been so worded, I should have acquiesced in 
silence, without presuming to offer objection or comment. It is not impro- 
bable that such was the interpretation intended by the writer ; in the care- 
less phraseology of conversation, learning and wisdom are so frequently 
confounded, that it is by no means unlikely that a hasty pen should pass on 
without staying to discriminate between them. I would readily agree with 
Conchilla, that it were better a woman should be loveable th^n learned i but 



200 Hetrospective Criticism, 

I would say also, that as learning will not necessarily render her less amiable, 
if she have inclination and leisure, there is no reason why she should not 
be both learned arid loveable ; and to this remark, I suspect, it will be wise 
in Conchilla to assent. 

Some other passages in the Magazine would tempt me to remark upon 
them ; but lest, by my own showing, I should prove myself to be the most 
unloveable of women, as being utterly destitute of wisdom, I will here con- 
clude, remaining, Sir, yours, &c. — Anglica. Saturday, May 31. 

Deciduous Scale on the Hills of Birds. — Mr. Yarrel has the credit of 
having first brought into notice the fact, that the bills of birds are, before 
they are hatched, strengthened by a deciduous scale, which enables them to 
perforate and burst the shell. {Jennings* s Ornithologia, p. 63.) This circum- 
stance, however, has been long known to rural housewives ; for, as soon as 
the chickens are hatched, the first care bestowed upon them is, displacing 
the scale with the nail of the thumb, to enable the young to pick up their 
food. — J. M. 

Translation and derivation of Technical Terms. — I take the liberty of 
saying that the practice you have adopted of translating the technical 
terms, and giving their derivation, is a very unpleasant one to the reader, 
and rather distracts him than otherwise. The translations, derivations, and 
accentuations might, I think with advantage, occupy, as a glossary, the last 
page of the Numbers. — J. Berwick, May 31. 

We hardly expected to be blamed for the very great trouble we take, 
and the expense that we incur with the printer, in giving the derivations 
complained of; but perhaps it is good for us to be chastened, for too much 
labour is as bad as too little. We acknowledge the unpleasantness com- 
plained of, but thought, and still think, the translations and derivations 
likely to have the best chance of being remembered when given where they 
occur; but perhaps they are not worth remembering, and if other readers 
are of the same opinion as A., we shall relinquish the practice. We mean 
to introduce all the important translations and derivations of technical terms, 
and scientific names given, into the general index at the end of each volume, 
where they will remain for future reference, as we do not intend to give 
(often at least) the translations and derivations of the same words twice. 
— Cond. 

The Perennial Calendar for various parts of Europe. — By noticing 
more particularly the wild plants, their affinities to birds and insects will be 
at length perceived ; and we might have (what I have often wished to see) 
a calendar by which the flowering of a plant should acquaint us with the 
appearance of a bird, and the appearance of an insect tell us the flowering 
of a plant. Undoubtedly there will be less trouble in generalising, by 
having, as you propose, a select number of plants and animals marked out 
the same for each station ; but if facts and useful observations are to be 
gathered, do not confine the observer to these ; let each, in addition, insert 
what is most applicable to his own locality, and interesting facts may then 
be obtained from each station. It is astonishing how many curious circum- 
stances in natural history have been noticed and forgotten, for want of a 
register to record them. This being no longer *he case, it is to be hoped 
that every naturalist will produce his store, that whatever is valuable may 
be gathered before it is too late. Would it not also be generally useful to 
have a list of the less common wild plants of each station ? We look into 
our Floras, and perceive the habitat of a rare plant put down in a place 
probably 150 miles from us, while perhaps it is lurking in our own vicinity 
all the while. To the traveller, to the botanist, and to the young enquirer, 
how useful would such lists be ! — Edunn Lees. Worcester, May 8. 1828.

Art. I. Some Account of an Ascent and Barometrical Measure- 
ment of Wha-ra-rai, a Mountain in the Isla7id of Ovohyhee ; ex- 
traded from the MS. Journal of Archibald MenzieSy Esq. F.L.S. 
Communicated by Mr. Menzies. 

Whilst His Majesty's ship, the Discovery, commanded by 
Captain Vancouver, lay in Karakakooa Bay, in January, 1794, 
I was very desirous of employing my time in examining the 
mountains and interior parts of the island, to collect plants, 
seeds, and other natural productions. For this purpose I 
consulted with Ta-maiha-maiha, king of the island, to obtain 
his permission ; and he not only complied with my request, 
but very obligingly promised that I should be attended by a 
chief, who would have sufficient power to protect me from any 
ill treatment, and provide for whatever provisions and attend- 
ance I should require in my excursions. He then wished to 
know what part of the island I meant to visit, when I told him 
that I proposed first to ascend, if possible, a considerable 
mountain, of a conic form, called Wha-ra-rai, situated a little 
to the southward of Toe-hah Bay. He then fixed on a chief 
named Harou, who had the charge of his own plantation at the 
village of Hanua-oora, near the foot of that mountain, to which 
place he advised me to go by water in one of his canoes, and 
there I should be supplied with every thing necessary for my 
journey. Harou being at this time alongside of the ship, he 
called him in, and gave him a most solemn charge of me, and 
everything I should carry with me; declaring that if I should 
have occasion to prefer any complaint against him on my re- 
turn, he should suffer for it most severely. 

The business being thus settled, Mr. Swaine, one of the 
lieutenants, and two or three gentlemen of the quarter-deck, 
volunteered to accompany me ; as did also a Mr. How^el, an 

Vol. I. — No. 3. p 



202 Ascent and Measurement of Wha-ra-rai, 

American gentleman, who had lately arrived herefrom China, 
with an intent to remain some time at these islands ; and I 
was very happy in having the pleasure of their society. 

Every thing being ready, we set out on the morning of the 
16th January, in company with Teamotoo, the chief of the 
district, and his wife, in a large double canoe, followed by 
Harou and our attendants in another; and, as we were passing 
the village of Kow-rowa, we were joined by Mr. Howel and 
his attendants in his own canoe. After this we proceeded to 
the northward close alongshore for about four or five miles 
from Karakakooa, when we entered a small cove surrounded 
by a scattered village belonging to Teamotoo. In this cove 
we saw the American schooner, which the natives had some 
time before captured with considerable cruelties. She was 
secured and housed over to preserve her from the weather, 
but we did not examine her condition closely, for fear of giv- 
ing offence ; we were told that she made a great deal of water, 
which they were obliged to pump out daily, otherwise that she 
would sink. 

We met here a seaman, who had landed from an American 
vessel some time before, and now employed himself in making 
charcoal, and laying up a store of it for any vessel that might 
be in want of such an article for working the forge. This was 
a useful hint for the natives, not only for working their own 
iron with greater facility, but likewise as a new article of 
traffic, of which they eagerly availed themselves ; for, on our 
coming into Karakakooa bay this time, we were quite sur- 
prised to see the natives bring alongside quantities of very good 
charcoal to dispose of. This man made choice of a delightful 
airy situation for his dwelling, which was kept neat and clean, 
and from which he had a commanding prospect of the cove 
and village nnderneath, of a large extent of country on both 
sides, and of the boundless ocean before him. We all dined 
with him on roasted pork, roasted fowls, and vegetables, in a 
very comfortable manner, as he had taught the natives who 
waited on him to cook and serve up his victuals in the Eng- 
lish style. After dinner we entertained him with a glass of 
good grog, to which he said he had long been a stranger ; this 
induced us to spare him a little of our stock of liquor at parting, 
when he earnestly requested us to send him some more, and 
likewise some tobacco, as soon as we returned to the vessels. 

We here parted with our friend Teamotoo ; and, on taking 
leave of us, he desired that, if our route should chance to pass 
through any of his plantations, we would demand whatever we 
wanted, and for this purpose he sent with us a person duly 
authorised. 



a Mountain in the Island of Owhyhee, 203 

We again embarked, in the cool of the evening, with our 
conductor, in one of the king's large double canoes, and pro- 
ceeded on to the northward till we reached Tai-ta-tooa Bay, in 
the bottom of which we landed at the village of Hanua-oora, 
under the noisy acclamations of a numerous group of men, 
women, and children, who expressed their joy by singing, 
dancing, and capering before us in such a frantic manner, that 
it was with great difficulty the chief could clear an avenue 
through them. He conducted us to a large house belonging 
to the king, which we were happy to find was within a tabooed 
space, so that we soon got clear of their teasing curiosity, and 
enjoyed our evening's repast and night's repose in quietness ; 
but the chief himself was up most part of the night, preparing 
for our journey inland, which was to commence from this 
place ; and, as it was likely we should be some days in the 
mountains, it was necessary to provide provisions of every 
kind, with a quantity of cloth and mats for our bedding at 
night,^ and men to carry the whole; so that the collecting 
and arranging of these matters was a weighty concern on 
Harou's mind. 

As it was my intention to ascertain the height of the moun- 
tain we were going to ascend, I brought with me a kind of 
portable barometer, for which I was entirely indebted to the 
Hberality of the late Colonel Gordon, at the Cape of Good 
Hope. That gentleman, when he understood that we had no 
portable barometer on board for ascertaining the height of any 
mountain that might be ascended during the voyage, presented 
me, in the most generous manner, with his own, which he had 
long been in the habit of using in the interior parts of Africa, 
and which had accompanied him in his interesting journeys 
through that country for many hundred leagues. The simplicity 
of its contrivance, and the ease with which it is carried and 
managed, may probably render it preferable, on such occa- 
sions, to a more expensive instrument, which, in ascending 
pathless rugged mountains, is so liable to be broken. I shall, 
therefore, subjoin a short description of it, and the manner of 
using it, leavkig the reader to judge of the probable degree of 
accuracy of the observations made with it at different heights, 
both in this and in my subsequent journey to the summit of 
Mowna-roa. 

It consists of a straight glass tube, about 3 ft. long, filled 
with mercury, which was doubly secured by a small stopper, 
and a piece of soft leather tied over the end of it ; this tube, 
together with a brass scale of about the same length, divided 
and subdivided into inches and tenths, was placed in a small 
wooden case, lined with cloth, where the scale was made fast, > 

p 2 



204 Ascent and Measurement of JVJia-ra-rai, 

but the tube had a little play : these, with a few ounces of 
mercury, carried in a stone or wooden bottle, completed the 
whole apparatus. 

For observing with this instrument, the mercury in the 
bottle is to be poured into a small open cup ; the stopper is 
then removed from the tube, and the vacancy in it must be 
filled up brimful with mercury; then, with a finger placed 
over the mouth of the tube, that end of it is to be inverted 
into the mercury in the cup, taking care not to withdraw the 
finger until it is well immerged. The mercury in the tube 
will then instantly sink down to its proper height, according 
to the weight or pressure of the atmosphere on its external 
surface at the time and place of observation ; and all that is 
further necessary to be done is to hold the tube quite upright, 
and measure, with the brass scale, the exact height of the 
column of mercury in the tube above the surface of the mer- 
cury in the cup, which will give the true height of the 
barometer at each station. 

I had but one tube, which I was fortunate enough to pre- 
serve whole in my different journeys ; but, to guard against 
accident, several of these tubes may be loosely packed in the 
same case, by rolling each of them up in a piece of cloth ; 
and it is almost needless to observe, that, in carrying them, 
the stopper ends should be kept uppermost. This case may 
be slung on a man's back, and carried with ease and safety 
over the most rugged mountains. 

On the morning of the 17th we had much difficulty in 
getting the party ready, and collecting together the provisions 
for our journey, which consisted of live hogs, poultry, taro, 
yams, cocoa nuts, and dried fish, in quantities that loaded 
upwards of twenty men ; but it was not possible to ascertain 
the number of carriers attached to the party, as some were 
sent on before, and some in different directions, to collect 
their loads, with orders either to follow or meet us on our way 
up. There were others appointed to carry our luggage ; one 
carried a kettle, another a gridiron, and a third, from the 
nature of his office, might be termed a butler, as he took 
charge of our liquor-case. Among other appointments we 
found that each of us had a man, whose sole business was to 
carry the cloth and mats for sleeping on, spread the couch at 
night, and roll it up again in the morning ; in short, there was 
no end to these various appointments, where the claimants for 
service were so numerous. Many of them, however, were 
unwilling to take a heavy load, but merely took some little 
thing or other, that they might be considered as belonging to 
the party, and by that means be allowed to accompany us ; 



a Mountain in the Island of Omhyhee. 205 

indeed, there was no possibility of making any retrenchments 
whilst we were in the midst of such bustle and confusion, and 
surrounded by such a numerous group of the natives. 

We therefore set out in the forenoon, in the best manner 
we could, for the mountain, which was directly back from the 
village; but, a little before our departure, I observed the 
barometer at high-water mark, where it stood at 30 in. 10 pts., 
and the thermometer in the shade was at 81°. At first our 
progress was slow, being exposed to the scorching heat of the 
meridian sun, over a dreary barren tract, of a gradual ascent, 
consisting of little else than rugged porous lava and volcanic 
dregs, for about three miles, when we entered the bread-fruit 
plantations, whose trees, with spreading boughs and beautiful 
foliage, were scattered about, at this distance from the shore, 
along the side of the mountain, as far as we could see on both 
sides. Here the country began to assume a pleasant and 
fertile appearance, through which we continued our route for 
about two miles further, surrounded by plantations of the 
esculent roots and vegetables of the country, industriously 
cultivated, till we came to the uppermost village, consisting of 
a few scattered huts, where we were importuned by our con- 
ductor to take up our abode for the night; and though we 
were impatient to go on as far as we could with daylight, yet 
we were obliged to comply with his request, as he wanted, he 
said, to muster his party, and make up any deficiency in our 
stock of provisions, before he quitted these plantations ; it also 
gave him time to send messengers back to Hanua-oora for 
whatever was forgotten or wanted. 

From this place we had a delightful view of the scattered 
villages and winding shore underneath us, and of the luxuriant 
plantations around us ; but a thick cloud enveloped the moun- 
tain and woods above us, from which, in the evening, wp had 
light refreshing showers of rain. 

Next morning the clouds dispersed, and gave us a fine pros- 
pect over the woods of the naked peak of Wha-ra-rai, which 
did not appear to be farther from us, in a direct line, than the 
village we had quitted at the sea-side. This gave us fresh 
spirits, and we set out pretty early, in expectation of soon 
accomplishing our object. After travelling about two miles 
by a narrow path, through an uncultivated tract, overgrown 
with ferns and small bushes, we entered the forest, the verge 
of which was adorned with rich and fruitful plantations of 
bananas and plantains, from which we supplied ourselves with 
a good stock for our journey. We then penetrated the wood 
by a winding path, so narrow that we could only follow one 
another; and in this manner we proceeded for about three 

p 3 



9S06 Ascent and Measuremerit of Wka-ra-rai, 

estimated miles, when we came to a resting place, lighted a 
fire, and breakfasted. Here I observed the barometer at nine 
in the morning, and found the mercury stood at 27 in. 35 pts. ; 
so that it had fallen, by our ascent, since yesterday morning, 
2 in. 75 pts., which gave our height at this station only 2660 ft. 
above the level of the sea. The thermometer was now at 
59°, which showed that we had already changed our temper- 
ature of climate 22°. 

After breakfast, we continued our journey by the same 
circuitous path in the woods, for about seven or eight miles, 
according to our estimation, when we came to the end of it, 
where we found a small hut that appeared to have been lately 
occupied by some of the natives, who had been thus far up the 
mountain, felling of trees, and shaping them out in the rough 
for canoes, planks, and other purposes; and, as it is necessary 
to make a path for dragging these down to the sea-side, this 
place appeared to be the farthest extent they had yet pene- 
trated up the mountain for timber. 

Here we were advised by our guide to stop for the night, 
as many of the party who were under heavy burdens, he said, 
had lagged behind, and were so tired, that they could not 
proceed further without some refreshment and a night's rest ; 
besides, he assured us that we were near the upper edge of the 
forest, and would, with ease, reach the top of the mountain 
early next day. We therefore took his advice ; and, as the 
party arrived, they in a short time erected a village of small 
huts, to shelter themselves and us comfortably for the night. 

Since we entered the wood in the morning, our view was 
limited by a continued dense forest of trees, bushes, and tall 
ferns, on both sides of our path, so that we saw neither the sea 
nor the mountain, though the day was quite clear and serene 
all the time. In many places we found the wood had been 
thinned, by the natives having cut down the larger trees for 
domestic and other purposes ; this afforded a good opportunity 
to botanise as we came along, by keeping several of the 
natives employed on both sides of the path, in bringing me 
branches of whatever tree, bush, or plant they could find 
either in flower, fruit, or seed. 

We observed here and there, on the side of our path, little 
consecrated spots, pointed out to us by taboo sticks, stuck in the 
ground, near a bush or under a tree ; in passing these places, 
the natives always muttered a prayer or hynm, and made 
some offering, as they said, to their JEatooa, or god, by 
leaving alittle piece of fruit, vegetable, or something or other, 
at these consecrated spots. Even in this distant solitary hut, 
we Ibund a corner of it consecrated by one of these taboo

sticks, which the natives earnestly requested us not to disturb 
or remove when we took possession of it : and we strictly 
obeyed their injunction, conceiving that sacred places and 
religious forms, whatever they are, ought to be held equally 
inviolable everywhere ; for the untutored savage, in worship- 
ping his god in a gloomy forest, may be as sincere in his prayer, 
and, probably, may derive as much consolation from his re- 
ligion at the awful moment of dissolution, as many more 
enlightened, who habitually bend the knee before a rich altar, 
and offer up their devotion in a splendid temple. 

Finding we were so near accomplishing our object, a mes- 
senger was despatched to Karakakooa, to make our progress 
known at the vessels, and to bring from thence some things 
wanted to render our situation comfortable on the mountain. 

In the evening, the thermometer stood at 58° ; and I was 
much surprised to find the temperature so nearly the same as 
it was in the lower part of the wood in the morning, though 
we had ascended, since that time, upwards of 4000 feet of the 
mountain. This was probably owing to the strong and con- 
stant exhalations going on in the daytime, amongst the aggre- 
gate assemblage of vegetables in this dense forest; keeping up 
a fanning breeze amongst the boughs, and tending greatly to 
diffuse the same temperature, even at different heights, through- 
out the woody regions of these mountains. But when this 
cause ceased at night, and a heavy dew or small rain pro 
duced a contrary operation, the temperature next morning 
was found to be very different, for the thermometer then was as 
low as 4-3*^, at half past seven ; which, in this instance, showed 
a difference of about 16°, between the extremes of what may 
be termed the temperate zone of these mountains. 

As we were now very eager to gain the summit of the 
mountain, we set out pretty early on the 19th, even contrary 
to the wishes of our guide and the rest of the natives, who, 
notwithstanding large fires being kept up, were continually 
coughing the whole night, and now complained so much of 
the cold, that they were unwilling to stir till the day advanced ; 
and well they might, for, besides the effect of the damp chilly 
air of the forest upon their constitutions and thinly clad 
bodies, they also powerfully felt the change in our tempera- 
ture, of nearly 40° by the thermometer, since we left the sea- 
side, in the space of little more than as many hours. 

The forest here being thinner of trees, and less encumbered 
with ferns and underwood, we began our progress, with a few 
attendants to direct our course, as there was no path ; and in 
about half an hour we got out, at the upper edge of the wood, 
where we saw the summit of our mountain at no great dis- 

p 4. 



208 Descriptive Notice of 

tance. The grass here was found covered with a heavy dew, 
partaking a good deal of the nature of hoar frost, which was 
so chilly and pinching to the bare feet of the natives, that they 
could not endure it, but were obliged to stop and kindle a fire, 
till the influence of the sun had reached them. We therefore 
left them to follow us as they could, and continued our ascent up 
the peak, which was steep and rugged, but thinly covered with 
grasses, and little thickets of low shrubs. These may be con- 
sidered as the alpine plants of this island, most of which were 
entirely new to me, and, though there were but few of them 
in flower, yet their variety, and the novelty of the tract, gave 
new life to my steps, and enabled me to reach the top of the 
mountain exactly at half past eight. The rest of the gentle- 
men followed me pretty close, and by ten the whole party 
crowded the lofty summit of Wha-ra-rai. 

As I observed that we were accompanied by a number of 
idlers, who were unwilling to burden themselves, I took the 
opportunity, as the party arrived upon the summit, to mark 
all those who were well loaded, by tying a piece of variegated 
tape round the arm of each, as a badge of distinction, telling 
them, at the same time, that on producing these badges, when 
we returned to the ship, they should be well paid for their 
service, whilst those who brought up small loads would receive 
but little. This induced several of the idlers to return to the 
plantations for loads, and as they arrived with them each had 
a similar badge ; but if any of them, after this, misbehaved, or 
was not sufficiently careful of what was entrusted to his charge, 
he was discarded, by taking his badge from him ; this pro- 
duced an emulation amongst them, which had a wonderfully 
good effect during the remainder of our excursion.

Art. II. Descriptive Notice of a Specimen of Lemur tardigradus 
Lin., Makis Cwv., kept alive for some Time at Edinburgh. By 
W. Baird, Esq. Communicated to the Plinian Society in May, 
1827. 

The Lemur {lemures, ghosts; resemblance to man) tardi- 
gradus. Slow Lemur, or Tailless Maucauco (Jig. 83.), has been 
described by Linnaeus, Buffbn, and others ; but, perhaps, as 
to manners and habits, most accurately by Vosmaer and Sir 
W. Jones, whose descriptions may be seen in Shaw's %oology. 
He is placed by Linnaeus next to the monkeys, as a connect- 
ing link between them and other animals, under the genus 
Lemur; and by Cuvier, under the quadrumanous animals. 




a Specimen of Lemur tardigradus, 209 

The genus Lemur of Linnaeus (the Mdkis of Cuvier), including 

animals with long ^ „,^^e^^ttKlU^^ ^'^ 

tails and great 
swiftness, as the 
Lemur catta and, 
the Lemur macaco^ ' 
&c., and animals 
without tails, and 
remarkable slow- 
ness of motion, as 
the Lemur tardi- 
gradus, &c., has 
been split by Cu- 
vier into several di- 
visions, after the example of M. Geoffrey. Two of this singu- 
lar genus are remarkable for their slowness of motion, and 
have been formed by that naturalist into a distinct genus, the 
Loris {loeris, a clown, Dutch ; name in Ceylon). This species 
is the Loris paresseux. (See published account, Philos. Journal, 
June, 1827.) 

Though he has been described by two or three different 
authors, and from live specimens, there are some particulars 
connected with his organisation, which apparently have not 
been taken notice of by any author I have been able to consult. 
A short description of his form and nature, therefore, as far 
as they have come under my notice, may not be uninteresting. 
The specimen described, I obtained at the beautiful island 
of Pulo-penang, or Prince of Wales* Island ; and as I now 
have had him in my possession upwards of nine months, and 
as no change has taken place in his growth in that time, I 
should consider him as a full-grown animal. He is one of the 
male sex, of a dusky ash colour, and is particularly well 
marked by a line of dark brown, running along the back ; his 
whole body is covered with a thick short fur ; a covering which 
is rather unusual in hot climates, but which seems well adapted 
for his habits and manners. His head is almost round; the 
face sharpened at the extremity ; ears short and flat, but wide 
and large otherwise. His eyes are large and very prominent, 
almost hemispheres in shape, and very much approximated ; 
they are of a yellowish brown colour, and are surrounded by 
a circle of dark brown, the same colour as that on the back. 
They shine brilliantly in the dark, especially when animated, 
glowing like heated furnaces; eyelashes short and black. 
When he closes his eyelids, he does -it in a manner different 
from any other animal I have seen ; instead of closing them by 
moving them togetlier, upwards and downwards, he draws the 



210 Descriptive Notice of 

skin diagonally from the sides ; a peculiarity rather remark- 
able, and which has not been taken notice of by any author I 
have seen. This, too, he does most especially when eating any 
hard substance, as a piece of lump sugar, &c. All the ani- 
mals we know belonging to the class Mammalia, like man, 
close their eyelids in a direction, upwards and downwards, 
and, in general, the upper eyelid is the one possessing the 
greatest degree of motion. In this animal, however, the eye- 
lids are brought together in a diagonal direction, or outwards 
and inwards, which gives him, at the moment of shutting his 
eyes, a most peculiar look ; and it is the under or outer eyelid 
that has the greatest degree of motion, the upper or inner one 
being almost fixed. At first sight it might appear that, in 
order to possess this lateral motion, the muscular apparatus of 
the internal eye must deviate from that of the animals of the 
class Mammalia; and that a separate muscle must be in exist- 
ence, attached to the outer or lower eyelid. Upon looking 
more attentively, however, we discern the inner can thus of the 
eye situate very low down in the face, and this circumstance, 
perhaps, may account for the manner in which he shuts his 
eyes. The orbicularis oculi muscle must be very powerful ; 
and from this position of the inner canthus, and the insertions 
the muscle being, in consequence of this, also low down in the 
face, it will act chiefly on the outer or lower eyelid ; and draw- 
ing it towards the inner one, which is only partially movable, 
thus close the eye in a diagonal direction. It is very much to 
be lamented, however, that Sir A. Carlisle's attention had not 
been directed to this peculiar appearance, before he disposed 
the specimen he had possession of; as the existence of a sepa- 
rate muscle attached to the lower eyelid, would constitute a 
remarkable deviation from the anatomy of the eyelids of the 
rest of the Mammalia. 

Reptiles, such as the frog, &c., have the same lateral motion 
of the eyelids as in the Lemur ; and these animals possess a 
separate muscle for this movement. * His pupil is very small, 
being very much contracted during the day. His fore legs 
terminate in hands like those of a monkey, with a soft, smooth 
palm, a thumb and four fingers, each provided with a small 

• The specimen dicil in the beginning of this year (1828), after Mr. Baird, 
the author of the paper, had left the country on a second voyage to India. 
The eye was dissected by an eminent comparative anatomist, Dr. Knox of 
Edinburgh, who found that the peculiar movement of the eyelids above 
described did not depend on any peculiar structure, but merely on the 
greater degree of strength of the orbicularis muscle. The lungs of the 
animal were found to be in a diseased state; and some parts of the skeleton 
were affected with eruptive appearances, similar to those which occur in apes 
brought from warm to cold countries. — P. N.

round nail. His hind legs are much longer than his fore ones, 
and are prehensile ; die great toe or thumb is placed nearly at 
right angles with his other toes, and is evidendy formed for 
grasping branches of trees, &c. ; the index toe, or fore finger, 
however, of the hind foot, has a peculiarity ; instead of a round 
nail, as all the other toes and fingers have, it is provided with 
a sharp sickle-formed claw, somewhat like that of the dog. 
This I have frequently seen him make use of in scratching 
himselli of which he is very fond. He has no tail, but there 
is a prominence in its place, which is very visible when he 
walks. 

A very remarkable appearance is presented by his tongue ; 
and though a specimen of this animal was dissected by Sir A. 
Carlisle, a good many years ago, this anomalous appearance 
has not been mentioned by him, and has been totally over- 
looked by all the other authors who have described him. 
Beneath the tongue proper, if I may so call it, which is some- 
what like that of the cat, though not rough, is another tongue, 
white-coloured, narrow, and very sharp-pointed, which he 
projects along with the other one when he eats or drinks, 
though he has the power of retaining it within his mouth at 
pleasure. I have not been able to see any particular use to 
which he applies it ; but, from its sharpness, it would appear as 
if it were formed for puncturing soft fruits, of which he is very 
fond, and which form great part of his food. Perhaps it may 
be formed for catching insects, as Sir W. Jones mentions that 
his specimen was very fond of grashoppers, and once or 
twice this animal has been seen to eat spiders. I have also 
found him to be exceedingly fond of flies ; he snaps them up 
most eagerly when presented to him, and also catches them 
himself, when they are reposing in the evening, upon the walls 
of the room. 1 have seen him use his double tongue, however, 
when eating them. When he licks the hand, as he now does 
(being so tame) frequently, he produces a sensation as if of 
something very hard and rough rubbing against the skin, 
which, 1 think, is produced by the second tongue ; though I 
am not perfectly certain whether it may not be his teeth. I 
have never seen it projected alone, . however, but always in 
company with the other. His teeth, especially the canine ones, 
are exceedingly sharp. 

These are the most remarkable particulars with regard to 
his external form. 

His manners and habits are also sufficiently interesting. 
His food consists of fruit and small animals, as birds and mice. 
The plantain is the fruit of which he is the most fond, and was 
the only food I saw him eat when I first got him into my 



212 Descriptive Notice of 

possession ; but as this, or any other fruit of the kind, could 
not be had during a voyage of four or five months, I became 
anxious to know what other sort of fruit he would eat. Touch- 
ing him rather incautiously soon after getting him, he very 
dextrously inserted his sharp canine teeth in my fingers, and 
with all the good will, too, of a creature accustomed to prey 
upon other animals in his native woods. Improving by such 
experience, and finding his teeth formed for tearing as well as 
masticating food, I offered him part of a recently killed fowl, 
of which he partook most eagerly : the necks of fresh-killed 
fowls, therefore, formed the major part of his food during the rest 
of the voyage. Small birds he is particularly fond of; these, 
when put into his cage, he kills speedily ; and, plucking the fea- 
thers off with all the skill of a poulterer, soon lodges the carcass 
inhis stomach. He eats the bones as well as theflesh; and though 
birds, and mice perhaps, are his favourite food, he eats other 
meat very readily, especially when quite fresh : if boiled, or 
otherwise cooked, he will not taste it. He prefers veal to all 
other kinds of butcher's meat ; eggs, also, he is fond of, and 
sugar is especially grateful to his palate : he likewise eats gum- 
arabic. As flesh is not always to be had quite fresh (the only 
state in which it is acceptable to him), he has for some time 
past been fed upon bread sopped in water, and sprinkled with 
sugar; this he eats readily, and seems to relish it much. 
M. Vosmaer mentions that his animal eat dry biscuit, but 
refused it if moistened with water; neither would it ever 
taste water. This is completely at variance with the habits of 
my animal, for he not only eats moistened bread, but laps 
water like a cat. When food is presented to him, if hungry, 
he seizes it with both hands, and, letting go with his right, 
holds it with his left all the time he is eating. Frequently, 
when feeding, he grasps the bars in the upper part of his cage 
With his hind paws, and hangs inverted, appearing exceedingly 
intent upon the food he holds fast in the left hand. He is ex- 
ceedingly fond of oranges ; but when they are at all hard, he 
seems very much puzzled how to extract the juice. I have, 
upon such an occasion, seen him lie all his length upon his 
back, in the bottom of the cage, and, firmly grasping the piece 
of orange with both hands, squeeze the juice into his mouth. ; 
The fffices are very peculiar, though they may, in a great 
measure, be influenced by his peculiar diet. They are very 
hard oval pellets, very much tapered at the extremity last 
discharged, and sometimes tapered off to a long thread, 2 
or 3 in. in length. As he generally eats the bones of the 
animals, or necks of the fowls, he is supplied with, this may, 
perhaps, render his faeces harder. They are still, however, 



a Specimen of Lemur tardigradus. 213 

hardlsh, even when he is not allowed to eat bones. Figs, when 
given him, have a very laxative effect ; but though his faeces are 
then soft, they do not lose their characteristic figure. He scat- 
ters his urine frequently when he moves about, leaving a train 
behind him. This he does almost as soon as he leaves his 
cage, rubbing, apparently, his tail upon the ground, as if to 
assist him in the act of expelling his urine. He has a very 
peculiar odour, sharp and pungent, especially when kept very 
warm. It is perhaps his urine that imparts this disagreeable 
smell. 

He generally sits upon his hind part (the hair of which is 
much worn by long sitting), close to the bars of his cage, 
grasping them firmly with his hind paws ; he then rolls him- 
self up like a ball, with his head in his breast, his thighs 
closely placed over his belly, and his arms over his head, 
generally grasping the bars of the cage with his hands also. In 
this position, and also without moving, he remains the whole 
of the day. Upon coming into the Channel, the cold weather 
affected him very much ; he was seized with cramp, and I at 
that time placed him in a small box, which was filled with 
very soft down. This he felt so agreeable, that, when cold, 
he never left it during the whole day, unless disturbed, and 
slept in it rolled up in the shape of a ball. 

He is exceedingly slow in his motions, and his trivial name, 
tardigradus, well marks his habit in that particular. He is 
evidently formed for preying by night, and for climbing trees. 
When he climbs, he first lays holds of the branch with one of 
his hands, and then with the other. When he has obtained a 
firm hold with both hands, he moves one of his hind paws, and, 
after firmly grasping the branch with it, he moves the other. 
He never quits his hold with his hind paws till he has obtained 
a secure grasp with his hands. When he walks, he moves his 
limbs in the same methodical manner as when he climbs. It 
is not till night that his activity commences, and this particular 
shows the beautiful arrangement of Providence. With such 
slow motions, were he to prey during the day, there is almost 
no animal but would very easily escape him ; he must, 
therefore, be awake during the night, and clamber the trees 
slowly and gently, to secure his prey, which I should think 
consisted chiefly of birds, when they are at roost. But though 
very much inclined to sleep almost the whole day, he does not 
seem so slothful as has been said by Vosmaer; though, per- 
haps, his habits may have been broken in upon by the treat- 
ment he met with on board the ship during his passage. Kept 
in an open part of the deck, surrounded by half the ship's 
company, and teased by the sailors in their idle moments, he 



214 Descriptive Notice of 

has perhaps become more watchful, and more easily disturbed, 
than was the case with M. Vosmaer's; who says that, during 
the day, he could clean out his cage without even disturbing 
him. In this animal, a very slight touch of his cage or the box 
in which he sleeps is sufficient to arouse him, and he then ob- 
serves all your motions with rather a jealous eye. He is very 
sensible to cold, and his thick fur coat was no doubt given him 
by his bountiful Creator as a protection against it. Incapable, 
from his slow habits and nature, of taking exercise violent 
enough to warm him during the winter, he is enveloped in 
this thick mantle, which renders him, in a great measure, in- 
dependent of moving about; and, rolling himself up like a 
ball, in a sheltered situation on the branch of a tree, grasping 
it strongly with his hind paws, he passes any short season of 
cold in as comfortable a manner, no doubt, as it is possible for 
such a slow animal to do, till the returning season of heat 
brings him warmth and comfort again. 

His temper, in cold weather especially, is very quick ; but, 
in general, he is rather timid, and never offers any injury 
unless incautiously touched, teased, or provoked : he then 
makes a shrill plaintive cry, evidently expressive of much 
annoyance, and bites very sharply. This cry has been men- 
tioned either by Vosmaer or Sir W. Jones, and described 
as resembling the sound ai ai, shrilly sounded, and repeated 
several times successively. When the cat annoys him, 
which she does very frequently, by leaping over him, he 
repeats the cry nearly a dozen times : it is always, however, 
expressive of anger. He has also another sort of cry, ex- 
pressive of eagerness to obtain any thing: this is much gruffer 
in sound, not shrill nor loud, but apparently made by forcing 
the air out of his nostrils. He likes much to be stroked under 
the chin and throat, and also under the arms, turning his head 
round to the hand like a cat, and lifting his arm, stretching it 
out beyond his head. Though not a very sensible animal, he 
is still evidently capable of feeling kindness, and showing re- 
sentment. He allows his throat and fore arm to be stroked, 
but refuses' to let the same liberty be taken with his hinder 
limbs. For some time, while in China, a little Chinese dog 
was his companion, sleeping in the same cage with him ; and, 
with the exception of a few occasional jars, they lived very 
comfoi-tably together. As the dog grew up, however, they 
were separated. A cat, the only animal in the house besides 
himself, has made many overtures to him, and, when he is 
allowed to get out of his cage, he is followed uj) and down the 
room by his feline companion, who evidently wishes to make

him her playfellow. Any undue familiarities, however, on her 
part are met with an immediate repulse from him ; and, one 
time, when patting him rather incautiously with her foot, he 
bit her so severely, that she now, though evidently wishing to 
be on good terms with him, keeps at a safe distance. This 
same cat has, since this, again become more familiar. Though 
not daring to approach him, she follows wherever he goes, to 
his great annoyance, and renders herself an object of his 
abhorrence. He cries out on her approach, and is sadly tan- 
talised by her playful trick of leaping over him. He seems to 
be rather a social animal notwithstanding. A large japanned 
tray attracts a good deal of his attention. Seeing his image- 
reflected in it, he walks before it, and tries to grasp his own 
image. Finding his efforts ineffectual, he imitates the action 
of the child, by peeping behind, with expectation to see the 
object there. Before a looking-glass he shows the same regard 
and curiosity. 

Vosmaer classed this animal among the sloths; but a very 
superficial view of him is enough to show^ the erroneousness 
of this opinion. Buffon, though classing it where Linnaeus 
has done, under the name of Loris, has evidently mistaken the 
animal entirely. Never having seen it, he has confounded it 
with another species of the same genus. " Viewing its figure, 
and the length of its legs, he could not imagine that it 
was slow in leaping or running." This, however, is not 
correct; for he is incapable of leaping, and, from his motion 
and manner, it is evident he never does leap. When irritated, 
I have seen him dart his body forward to seize the offend- 
ing object; but, in doing this, his general habits were clearly 
evinced, his body only being bent, while his hind feet held 
fast the perch on which he stood, and he made use of them only 
as a fulcrum, or purchase, to increase the celerity of his move- 
ment. 

I could obtain no information from the natives who brought 
me this specimen, regarding his habits and economy : Sir W. 
Jones mentions that by the Indians he is called the bashful 
ape ; but with regard to his history the natives were entirely 
ignorant. He is the second specimen I have seen of this 
species, which, I believe, has been rarely met with in this coun- 
try before. 

A very singular anatomical particularity, which in course I 
have not seen myself, was. observed and pointed out by Sir 
A. Carlisle, who had a rare opportunity, some years ago, of 
dissecting an animal of this kind. The subclavian artery, 
soon after entering the axilla, divides into twenty-three equal-

sized cylinders, which surround the principal trunk, now 
diminished into a very small vessel, accompanying each other 
in their course down the arm, and dividing along with the 
ulnar and radial arteries. The iliac artery, at the margin of 
the pelvis, divides into upwards of twenty equal-sized cylin- 
ders also, in the same manner as the subclavian. These 
cylinders, in their course, are distributed to the muscles, each 
muscle having a cylinder to itself; the trunks of the arteries 
distributing themselves to the other parts, as in other animals. 



Art. III. Notice of a remarkable Hare (Lepus timidus L.), caught 
at Durifanaghy in Donegal. By John V. Stewart, Esq. 

Sir, 
The hare, of which the accompanying sketch (Jig» 84.) is 
a very correct representation, was caught by me in a snare, 




about three months ago ; and, as I am making a collection of 
the beasts, birds, and insects indigenous to this country, and 
take a great interest in subjects connected with zoology, I 
have preserved it, and placed it in my museum. After 1 had 
removed the skin, previously to stuffing it, the lump, which is 
about the size of a hen's egg, remained attached to the throat 
and sides of the neck, by a membrane which, surrounding it, 
formed an internal bag within the skin. As this membranous 
covering, and the skin surrounding it, were kept distended at 



Airaiigement of British Falcons. 217 

the top, by their connection with the sides of the neck, and at 
the bottom by the lump, it had the appearance, when the hare 
was standing, as if the lump extended all the length of the 
pocket ; but, when the hare was in motion, or the lump was 
subjected to pressure with the hand immediately under the 
throat, it was evident that the lump was pendulous, and 
entirely confined to the lower part of the pouch The pouch 
was rather more than 5 in. long, and about 7 in. in cir- 
cumference, covered with fur similar in every respect to 
that on the throat. The lump, which was nourished by large 
blood-vessels, communicating with it from the neck, presented 
no appearance of disease ; it resembled the other fleshy parts 
of the animal, and was not in the least degree callous. From 
these circumstances, several medical gentlemen to whom I 
have shown it since I preserved it in spirits, are induced to con- 
sider it as not cancerous ; I am, however, myself disposed to 
think, though possessing no surgical knowledge, that it must 
originally have arisen from a diseased state of some of the 
glands, and that as the lump so produced increased in size, it 
became to a certain degree detached, and thus by its own 
weight produced the pouch which gives the hare this singular 
appearance. Had the animal been suffered to live, the pouch 
must soon have come in contact with the ground, and would 
probably in a short period have ulcerated, and terminated its 
life. It had every appearance ol' being an old hare ; the bod}' 
appeared to be in a very healthy state, and it would in a short 
time have had two young ones. 

I have the honour to be. Sir, &c.

Art. IV. An Arrangement of the different Species of Falcons 
found in Great Britain. By T. F. 

Sir, 

Some observations and slight omissions of your correspond- 
ent Z. B., under your article " Retrospective Criticism," 
(p. 94.), have induced me to offer, to such of your readers as 
may feel an interest in becoming acquainted with the number 
of falcons found in their native island, an arrangement of the 
genus Falco of Linnaeus, divided into sections according to the 
system of modern naturalists, and accompanied with a few 
remarks; referring such as may wish for further information, 
to Temmmck's Maiiuel d' Ornithologie, and Selby's Illustra-. 
iions of British Ornithology.

Andngement of British Falcoils. 



Order RAPACIOUS (^ccipitres Linn,), 
Genus Falcon (Faico Linn^) 

Section I. Falcons, 

This section contains the true falcons, being chiefly those 
which were made use of in falconry, and called long-winged 
hawks, from the closed wings reaching to, or almost to, the 
end of the tail. 

1. Gerfalcon (Falco islandicus Lath,), [Jig, 85.) — This is 
one of the boldest birds of the 
whole genus, and was used in ^ 
falconry for the larger species 
of game. Its native country 
is Iceland. The White Ger- 
falcon, Brown Gerfalcon, Ice- 
land Falcon, and Greenland 
Falcon are considered syno- 
nymous. It rarely occurs in 
England. 

2. Peregrine Falcon (Falco 
peregrinus Li?tn.), — The Hag- 
gard Falcon, Barbary Falcon, 
Yearling Falcon, and Red 
Falcon are considered as only 
changed in plumage, as is also 
the Lanner of the Brit, Zool, ; I 
but the Lanner of Lath, and 
the Arct, Zool, is placed by Temminck as a distinct species, 
which is said to be found in Hungary and Russia, and has 
never been met with in England that I am aware of The 
Common Falcon (Falco communis) is also placed among the 
synonyms of the Peregrine. 

S. Kestrel (Falco Tlnnunculus Linn), — 4. Hobby (Falco 
Subbuteo Linn,). — 5. Merlin (Falco -^^salon Li?in,), The 
Stone Falcon is doubtless only an old male, becoming bluish- 
grey above. 

Section II. Eagles, 

These birds are more powerful than the former, but not so 
rapid in flight. 

1. Golden Eagle (Falco Chrys£letos Li7in,), (Jg. 86.)— The 
Black Eagle of Pennant, and the Ring-tailed Eagle (Falco 
fiilvus) of other English authors, are clearly ascertained 
to be the young.

2. Cinereous Eagle (Falco 
Albicilla Linn.). — The Sea 
Eagle (Falco Ossifragus) has 
been satisfactorily ascertained 
to be no other than the young ; 
though it appears surprising, 
that a bird, which has been 
generally described as larger 
than the Cinereous, should 
now be pronounced the young 
of the latter. This teaches us 
how careful naturalists should 
be to take descriptions them- 
selves, and not to copy merely 
what their predecessors have 
said, who perhaps have never 
seen the thing they attempt to describe. The Bald Eagle 
(Filco leucocephalus) is considered by some a variety of the 
Cinereous ; but Temminck, I think, from his observations, is 
authorised in continuing them distinct. — 3. Osprey (Falco 
//aliaeetus Linn.), 

Section III. Hawks. 

The birds of this section 
are those in falconry called 
short-winged hawks, their 
closed wings being far distant 
from the tip of the tail. 

1. Goshawk (Falco ^alum- 
barius Linn.). {Jig. 87.) — 
Your correspondent Z. B. has 
omitted this bird. It is very 
rare in England, but breeds in 
Scotland and the Orkneys. 
The Gentil Falcons of the 
Brit. Zool, are doubtless only 
the young of the Goshawk. 
It may here be well to observe, that modern ornithologists 
consider that there is no such bird as the Gentil Falcon, as a 
distinct species. The birds that have been described under 
that name appear to me to differ much, some being long- 
winged hawks, and others short. The former will be gene- 
rally found to correspond with some state of plumage of the 
Peregrine, and the short-winged with that of the Goshawk. 
The term Gentil has caused confusion, from having been ap-

plied to any species that had been rendered gentle, and fit for 
the purpose of falconry. 

2. Sparrowhawk (Fal- 88 

CO Nhus Linn,), — I 
should feel obliged by 
any of your correspond- 



ents informing me, 



through your Magazine, 
if they have ever seen 
a female Sparrowhawk, 
with a blue back, like 
that of the adult male. I 
have seen several, but 
never a blue-backed one, 
which makes me doubt 
its occurring, unless in very old birds.

vorus Linn,), 

Section VI. Harriers.

Linn.). (Jg, 90.) 

The Ringtail is now, beyond 
all doubt, ascertained to be the 
female, or young of the Henhar- 
rier. 

2. Marsh Harrier, or Moor 
Buzzard (Falco rufus Linn.). 

3. Ash-coloured Harrier (Fal- 
co cineraceus Montagu). 

As Selby rightly observes, we 
are indebted to the persevering 
researches of our countryman, 
Montagu, for the discovery of this 
new species of falcon, in whose 
Ornithological Dictionary and 
Supplement a full account may

be found. It is to be hoped, that the pubUc will be favoured 
with a new edition of that excellent work, which contains 
much practical information, but has been out of print seve- 
ral years. The correct work of Selby may be thought 
to supersede it, but as that does not give the dimensions, 
the size of a bird cannot be ascertained without his Il- 
lustrations^ which are much too expensive to be generally 
obtained, and a dictionary of the provincial names is highly 
desirable. From the foregoing list, it appears we have 
seventeen species of falcons, and, I believe, no more, though 
others have been placed in our Fauna, such as the Spotted 
Falcon and Grey Falcon of the Brit. ZooL, which I have 
but little doubt are not distinct species; the latter being 
no other than a Gerfalcon, and the former a Gerfalcon 
or variety of the Common Buzzard, though Montagu, in 
his Supplement^ seems to think the Spotted Falcon a dis- 
tinct species. The great confusion among the falcons has 
arisen chiefly from the difference of plumage, which exists 
between the adults and young of several species, and from the 
various changes which they undergo in arriving at maturity ; 
the complete dress not being attained in some till the fourth 
or fifth year, and even later. The term noble appears to me 
to have been applied, not to all such as take their prey in the 
air, which is the definition given by your correspondent Z. B., 
and who, in that case, I think, improperly excludes the eagles, 
which, according to Temminck and Montagu (see Montagu's 
Supplement^ article Eagle^ Ring-tail), pounce their prey on 
the wing, but to have been used to denote such as were used 
in falconry only, which was formerly the sport only of princes 
and noble persons,

Art. V Some Account of Francesco Redis Experiments on the 
Generation of Insects. By T. L. H. 

Sir, 
It is, I believe, well known, that, till the time of Redi (died 
in 1697, aged 70), equivocal generation was the subject of 
general belief. This celebrated Italian physician was the first 
to prove, by that infallible test, experiment, that insects were 
not engendered in putridity. The work in which he recounts 
his labours to do this, is in the form of a letter to the Signor 
Carlo Dati, and consists of a hundred and fourteen close 
octavo pages. It is true that in this space there is much 

Q 3 



^^ Recti's Experiments o?i the Generation of Insects. 

matter irrelevant to the main subject, as he wanders to various 
observations on the nature and habits of bees, wasps, and one 
or two other insects ; but the whole of it is well worth the 
study of any one who can give their attention to it, and who 
understands the language; for it has, I think, never been 
translated, however it may have been borrowed from. 

After some moralising, and some expressions of his dif- 
fidence and intended accuracy, our author enters on his 
subject. He commences with some observations on the 
opinions of the ancients, which were somewhat as follows : — 
They believed that when the earth issued from the hands of 
its Maker, it immediately began clothing itself in a green 
down, similar to that on young birds, which, strengthened by 
the light of the sun, and the earth's own juices, gradually 
expanded into herbs and trees; these were intended to 
sustain the animals it afterwards produced. Not content 
with this, it aspired to become the acknowledged mother of 
man ; and the Stoics affirm, that soon after men began to bud 
forth upon the face of the earth, as we now see mushrooms. 
Some, indeed, believed this to be confined to particular parts 
of the world, and the Ethiopians, Egyptians, and Phrygians, 
all claim this honour for their native countries. Besides these, 
the Arcadians, the Phoenicians, and Atticans boast of the 
same glory for their lands, but more particularly the Athe- 
nians, who, it is well known, wore a golden cicada in their 
hair, to denote that their forefathers sprang from the earth, 
as those insects are still supposed to do. Meantime, the earth, 
says Redi, non ancora ben esperta in questo mestiere *, as yet 
produced but imperfect animals ; so that sometimes they were 
seen, this wanting a feature, that a limb, while others again 
presented a monstrous mixture of different beasts, or even of 
man and beast. But, still aspiring, she at length succeeded 
in producing perfect animals, and perfect men. The men 
were at first little worms, which, by degrees, assumed the 
human figure. At length, old and worn out, she became 
sterile; but although she no longer retained the power of 
generating men and other large animals, she was still able to 
bring forth insects and such small creatures, as well as plants, 
supposed to spiing up spontaneously and without seed, which 
power she has ever since retained, and ever will. Some sup- 
pose this power of the earth to be innate, others that she was 
impregnated by the light of the sun, or its heat; and, in short, 
various other conjectures have exercised the imagination of 
philosophers. 

* Not yet very expert in this businci>s. 



Redi's Expet'iments on the Generation of Insects. 2-23' 

Another opinion was, that insects were generated by the 
collection of the fundamental atoms of the universe into small 
bodies. " But," says our author, " that great philosopher of 
our times, William Arveo, is of opinion that all creatures 
come from the seed, either of their own species, or of any 
other animal, indifferently ; or are propagated by generative 
atoms, which float about in the air ; but whence, or how, these 
atoms have their origin, he does not say. Among the various 
opinions of past philosophers, cited by Redi, the following is 
too curious to be omitted, though, if I noticed all, it would 
prolong this article to a tedious and unnecessary length. I 
mean that of Kircher, respecting the propagation of snakes. 
" Take some snakes," says that author, in the twelfth book 
of his Subterranean World, " of whatever kind you want, 
roast them, and cut them in small pieces, and sow those pieces 
in an oleaginous soil ; then, from day to day, bathe them 
lightly with water, from a watering-pot, taking care that the 
piece of ground be exposed to the spring sun, and in eight 
days you will see the earth strewn with little worms, which, 
nourished with milk mixed with the water, will gradually 
increase in size till they take the form of perfect serpents. 
This," adds he, " I learned from the carcass of a serpent, 
which I found in the country; it was covered with worms, 
some small, others larger, and others again that had evidently 
taken the form of serpents. And what renders it still more 
marvellous, is, that among these little snakes, and mixed as it 
were with them, there were certain flies which I should take 
to be engendered in that substance, which constituted the 
aliment of the snakes." " Thus far Kircher," says Redi ; 
^' and I, moved by the authentic testimony of this most learned 
writer, have often made the trial ; but I never could witness 
the generation of these blessed little snakes made to hand." 

Wishing to sift the truth of these opinions by personal 
observation, he had three snakes, which he calls Angui 
d'Esculapio, killed, and put into an open box. These were 
soon covered with little worms, all alike in shape, being 
conical, but of different sizes, as they were produced at differ- 
ent times, which increased daily both in size and number. 
Having consumed the flesh, they all escaped through the fis- 
sures of the box, leaving the naked bones in a corner. He 
again had three of these snakes killed, and put them into a 
box as before ; in a few days they were peopled with worms, 
of the same shape as the former ; but some, less than the rest, 
were inclined to flesh colour, while the others were entirely 
white. Having devoured the snakes, they anxiously sought 
to escape ; but as he had taken more care than before in se- 

2 4 



224- Redi*s Experiments on the Generatio7i of Insects, 

curing all the outlets in the box, they were unable to effect 
this. Gradually they became more quiet, and, after some 
time, lay motionless, as if asleep. Shrinking into themselves, 
they imperceptibly took the form of an egg, and, by the 
twentieth day, they had all assumed this figure. At first they 
were of a white colour, but by slow degrees became first 
golden, then red. Some remained of this colour, but the rest 
continued to become darker and darker, till they were quite 
black ; and, from soft and tender, their skin had changed to 
the hard and brittle shell of the chrysalis or aurelia. On 
examining these more closely, he found the black ones were 
more strongly marked than the others, which were nearly 
smooth. At the end of eight days the red chrysalides burst, 
and from each issued a fly of a dull ash colour, " turbid, dis- 
mayed, and, so to speak, wrinkled and unfinished," with its 
wings yet unfolded ; but, in the space of a quarter of an hour, 
it dilated its little body, unfolded its wings, " and, relinquish- 
ing the sad ash colour, it was dressed in a vivid green, mar- 
vellously brilliant. It was now so much larger than before, 
that it seemed impossible to conceive that its little shell could 
have contained it." In fourteen days some of the black ones 
burst, and produced a larger fly, " black, marked with white, 
hairy on the abdomen, and red at the nether end ; such as 
daily frequent butchers' shops, or any place where there is 
dead flesh. At first they were like the others, slow, slovenly, 
and sluggish in their appearance." In seven days after, the 
rest of the chrysalides burst, and liberated certain little black 
flies, smaller and brisker than both the other kinds, which 
Redi says he believes to have been undescribed by any former 
naturalists. It would be a useless task to pretend to ascertain 
the exact flies Redi speaks of, as, notwithstanding his vivid 
descriptions of their beauty, his terms are too general to afford 
any assistance in the enquiry. Our main point is to state how 
he attained his grand object, without entering into minute and 
unnecessary details. 

So many different flies from the same kind of flesh, did not 
dismay, but, on the contrary, stimulated him to fresh exer- 
tions ; instead, therefore, of only one kind, he put many into 
different boxes, and obtained the same result as before, except 
that the different species of insects were more numerous. He 
next put some skinned river frogs into a glass vessel, which 
he left open ; on the following day, he found them covered 
with worms, some sporting in the fetid liquor that had stilled 
from the carcass, while the rest depastured on the frogs. On 
the third day he found they had all decamped, leaving nought 
of the frogs but the bones. Some fish from the Arno were the 



Redi's Experiments on the Generation of Insects. 225 

next victims to his inquisitive spirit, and these also were soon 
peopled ; but on these, and the sides of the box in which they 
were placed, he observed not only worms, but also some very 
small eggs, which, crushed between the nails, gave a white 
subtle liquid, clearer and less viscous than the white of birds' 
eggs. By the twentieth day they were all hatched, and the 
worms had increased to twice their original size, and went 
about twenty-five or thirty to the grain ; but, next day, they 
were so amazingly enlarged, as to weigh about 7 grains each. 
Meanwhile, they continued devouring the fish, and, finally, 
left nothing but the bones ; and these " they left as white and 
clean as if they had issued from the hands of the most diligent 
anatomist in Europe." Having taken means to prevent their 
flight, which they all attempted, he watched their gradual 
progress towards perfection. The perfect insects were of five 
kinds ; four he had seen before, the fifth, a little black fly, 
greatly exceeding the number of its pupae, which were black 
and large, he had never observed till then. Seeing this curious 
disproportion, he opened one or two of the pupae, and found 
that they contained, upon an average, from twenty-five to 
thirty flies, but never more than forty. After this, he made 
many more experiments on lion's flesh, tiger's, and, in fact, 
multitudinous species offish, flesh, and fowl, cooked and raw, 
and found that the insects were promiscuously produced on 
all kinds of meat ; and, indeed, one piece would sometimes 
contain all the species he had observed, and he generally ob- 
served not only worms but eggs. The eggs reminded him of 
the impurities left upon meats by flies (that afterwards become 
worms), which butchers and housewives guarded against by 
defending them with gauze coverings. 

This made him doubt whether the eggs he had perceived 
were not deposited on the meat, by flies similar to those they 
produced, instead of being generated by the corruption ; the 
more, because he invariably found that flies, resembling those 
afterwards produced from their eggs, alighted upon the flesh 
previously to the appearance of the worms ; " but vain would 
have been the doubt, if experience had not proved this." To 
do so, he put into four wide-necked flasks, a snake, some 
river fish, some eels from the Arno, and some veal, and covered 
the mouths with paper, tied on tight, and sealed. As many 
more flasks, containing similar meats, he left open. In a few 
days, the fishes and meat in the open flasks were, as usual, 
covered with worms ; in the closed flasks, the flesh, although 
putrid, was entirely free from worms, though, on the outside 
of the paper, there were a few worms as well as eggs ; the 
former, in vain, using every endeavour to enter. After this. 



226 RedPs Experiments on the Generation of Insects, 

he made many similar experiments, and always found that 
uncovered meats shortly teemed with life ; while, on the con- 
trary, those that had no communication with the external air, 
corrupted, but never verminated. During the course of these 
experiments, he ascertained the curious fact, that when the 
common fly dies, it serves as a nest for its own species equally 
with any other kind of dead flesh. Not yet satisfied, he deter- 
mined on making a new experiment. He put some meat and 
fish into a large vessel, covered with very fine gauze, which 
he also put into a large box, covered with the same gauze, 
that the air might penetrate to the meats, while it remained 
free from the intrusion of insects. On these he did not see a 
single worm, but frequently saw the little creatures writhing 
about on the outer gauze, trying to make their way through; and 
it was with difficulty that he was once quick enough to prevent 
two of them from falling on the meat, for they had got their 
bodies half through the inner gauze. He also observed the flies, 
attracted by the meat, and unable to make their way to it, 
drop their eggs upon the gauze ; some of them alighting upon 
it, others hovering in the air during the operation ; and he 
perceived that each left six or seven eggs at a time. This was 
the point he wished to attain, and he had now discovered that 
insects supposed to be engendered by corruption, were, in 
reality, propagated by their own species. 

Notwithstanding his liberal philosophy, and his active ex- 
perimenting, Redi falls into the most extraordinary error ; he 
asserts that some plants, fruits, &c., produce insects. That one 
who went so far should go no farther, but cease his experiments 
just where he ought to have pursued them still more zealously, 
appears incomprehensible ; it would seem that he had pur- 
posely left to others the glory of finishing what he had so 
nearly accomplished. It is the more marvellous, as in one 
particular instance he was so near the truth. Let me use his 
own words. Speaking of the galls in oaks, he says, " I freely 
confess, that having made my first experiments on the gene- 
ration of insects, I was inclined to believe, or rather suspect, 
that perhaps the gall was caused by an insect, which, coming 
in the spring, and making a little fissure in the tenderest 
branches of oaks, secreted an egg in that fissure, which was 

the cause of the excrescence, and I was inclined to 

think that the gall was a disease, occasioned by the puncture 

of the fly, as we see tumours arise on the human body, 

from the same cause." After various doubts, he says, " It seems 
more probable that the generation of insects born in trees, 
should not be chance generations, nor caused by any fly de- 
positing its egg there, as each gall has its particular insect, a

227 



rule without an exception ;" but that it should be produced 
by the tree itself. It did not strike him, that the " particular 
insects " might cause the peculiarities of the gall, nor that the 
*' particular insects " might choose particular trees in which to 
deposit their eggs. The insects found in fruits, he also sup- 
poses to be generated by virtue of the tree itself, and without 
any pre-communication with the perfect insect. In support 
of this doctrine he supposes trees to be endowed with sens- 
ation, and brings many revered names to assist him in his

Art. VI. Some Account of the Hessian Fly. By the Reverend 
William Kirby, M. A. F.R. and L.S. 

Sir, 

No departments of natural history are more generally in- 
teresting than those which connect it with agriculture. I need 
not, therefore, apologise for making known to the public, 
through the medium of your useful Magazine, the name and 
characters of an insect, which, under the appellation of the 
Hessian fly, has done as nmch damage to the crops of wheat 
in North America, and created as much alarm in this country, 
lest it should be imported, as any depredator of its class ever 
did.* Having been long anxious to ascertain what the insect 
was, that had attained to such celebrity for the injuries it was 
the author of, I applied to a friend connected with America to 
give what information he could procure, but without success ; 
till, very recently, I met with a paper of Mr. Say's upon this 
very subject, inserted in the Journal of the Academy of Natural 
Sciences of Philadelphia for the year 1817. 

I had, in the Linnean Trans- 
actions, long ago, under the 
name of Tipula ^ritici {fig. 91. 
a), given an account of a little 
orange-coloured gnat, which I 
conceived to be injurious to the 
wheat crops of this country, 
by causing the inanition of the 
grain wherever it laid an egg f , 
which was within the glumes 
of the florets. This gnat, in 
the modern system, belongs

to the genus Cecidomyia, though it does not, like the other 
species, produce galls in the plants it infests. To this same 
genus the Hessian fly, according to Mr. Say, also belongs, and 
he names it Cecidomyia destructor (6). 

The antennae of the male are shorter than the body, some- 
what slenderer towards the tip, with hairs in whorls, monili- 
form, with the joints connected by a transparent thread. The 
head and thorax are black ; breast sometimes fulvous ; wings 
black, fulvous at the base, fringed, longer than the abdomen ; 
legs pale, covered with black hairs; abdomen brownish. In 
the female, the joints of the antennae are not connected by a 
transparent thread, and the abdomen is fulvous, with a dorsal 
and ventral black interrupted vitta. 

A species of Ceraphron (C. destructor) deposits its eggs in 
the larva, and keeps this destructive little pest within due 
limits, otherwise Mr. Say supposes that the crops of wheat 
would be totally annihilated. The female deposits from one to 
eight or more eggs upon a single plant of wheat, between the 
vagina of the inner leaf and the culm nearest the roots ; in 
which situation, with its head towards the root or first joint, 
the young larva passes the winter. They eat the stem, which 
thus becomes weak, and breaks. 

This species, and C. A'itici above mentioned, from their 
causing no galls, appear to form a distinct group in the genus 
Cecidomyia, with which, however, they agree in the characters 
assigned to it by Meigen. 

As few entomologists appear to have been aware of the 
above discovery of Mr. Say's, I hope this short account of it 
will not be unacceptable to your readers.

Art. VII. An Introductory Viexu of the Linnean System of 
Plants, By Miss Kent, Authoress of Flora DoniMca, Sylvan 
Sketches^ &c. 

The vegetable world was so little known in ancient times, 
that the number of plants described by the Greek and Roman 
writers does not exceed fourteen hundred ; less than a thir- 
tieth part of the number now known. Some allowance, per- 
haps, should be made for the fact, that some modern botanists 
have multiplied species, by so denominating mere varieties ; 
while it is most probable that, in ancient times, many distinct 
species were confounded together. Still the number of plants 



Linnea7i System of Plants, 229 

known to those early writers must have been very small ; and 
even that small number were very imperfectly understood. 
They had not, as we now have, a language by which every 
botanist is clearly intelligible to another ; the description of 
one plant was very frequently appUcable to many others ; and, 
at this distance of time, it is, in many instances, impossible to 
ascertain what were the plants intended. Hence have arisen 
conjectures without end, upon questions which can never be 
determined. Thus, the ancient hyacinth is, by some, sup- 
posed to have been the Eastern flower which now bears 
that name ; by others, on account of certain figures on the 
petals, it is believed to have been what we now term the 
martagon lily; and many think it was the larkspur. The 
mallow, so important as an esculent vegetable, and mentioned 
as such by Horace, and in the Old Testament, is now un- 
known. Most probably we have the plant, but are unable 
positively to identify it; and it is the same with many others. 

It was not till towards the end of the sixteenth century, 
that botany was reduced to any sort of system. The first 
systematic arrangement of vegetables was published by Caesal- 
pinus, an Italian physician, in the year 1583. Many others 
succeeded, which, however ingenious, were of little public 
utility, because no one was generally adopted ; until the ad- 
mirable system of I^innaeus, towards the middle of the 
eighteenth century, prevailed over all others, and was univer- 
sally approved and followed. 

There is at present, however, a sort of rivalry between the 
system of Linnaeus and what is termed the natural method of 
Jussieu. The heart-burnings of rivalry and party spirit should 
not be suffered to approach the — may we say — amiable 
science of botany. Linnaeus himself was earnest for a natural 
arrangement, and was well aware of its importance. He left 
what he called a fragment of a natural method, which he re- 
commended succeeding botanists to perfect; not as a suc- 
cessor, but as a companion, to his own beautiful system. It 
has been well observed by Mr. Bicheno, that " the two 
great masters of botanical science propose different ends, 
and ought not to be regarded as rivals." The artificial sys- 
tem of Linnaeus enables us to become acquainted with indivi- 
duals; and, for this purpose, the object is to divide and to 
define : the natural method of Jussieu looks to their connec- 
tions and affinities; consequently its object is diametrically 
opposite to the former, and its business is combination. For 
a precise knowledge of the different species of plants, the sys- 
tem of Linnaeus is unrivalled ; and it is only by an accurate 
knowledge of the species, that we can avail ourselves of their 



230 Introductoiij View of the 

various properties. Let us not undervalue the labours of 
Jussieu ; an accomplished botanist should be acquainted with 
both these systems; but we would recommend the young 
student to commence with the Linnean, as being at once the 
easiest in practice, and the least to be dispensed with. 

When we say that Linnaeus divided the vegetable kingdom 
into twenty-four classes, each of which classes is again di- 
vided into several orders, these subdivided into genera, and 
the genera into species, let it not be supposed that all these 
various terms and subdivisions increase the difficulty to the 
young student, for the truth is diametrically the reverse. Let 
the reader suppose that he has a plant before him, of which 
he would learn the history. He must first ascertain its name. 
Among nearly 50,000 plants he has to seek this one. It will 
readily be seen that if he has to plunge into the midst of all 
these numbers, and to compare the plant before him with the 
full description of each individual species, until he meets with 
one corresponding to it, it will be a task demanding a large 
portion both of time and patience, and he will be fortunate if 
his plant be not entirely withered and decomposed, before he 
have accomplished the work. Let him, then, suppose that, by 
observing one or two particular characters, he ascertains that 
it belongs to a class, containing about two thousand plants ; 
that, by another glance, he understands it to be of an order 
of that class, containing two hundred ; his task is now consi- 
derably reduced, but by a little further observation, he yet di- 
minishes the number much more, before he has recourse to 
the full descriptions of the plants. The order to which it 
belongs is arranged in several divisions, according to some 
conspicuous characters ; by attention to these, the number is 
reduced to forty or fifty. By a little closer inspection, he 
assigns it to the proper genus ; and now, instead of compar- 
ing it with the detailed description of 50,000 plants, he has 
but six, a dozen, or perhaps twenty, to examine. In many 
cases, he may ascertain the particular species, without having 
occasion to go through the full description of any one but 
that which actually belongs to it. What would have been 
a tedious task, is thus converted into an interesting occupa- 
tion, and he is surprised to find how easy is that which he 
imagined to be so difficult. The difficulties have been met, 
and overcome, by those who have given them the station and 
the name that rightfully belong to them. It is this which 
displays the skill of the botanist ; and to do this, if necessary, 
it should be the ambition of the student to qualify himself. 

The Linnean system is founded upon the parts of fructifi- 
cation, of which there are usually reckoned seven ; the calyx. 



Linnean System of Plants, 231 

the corolla, the pistil, the stamen, the pericarp, the seed, and 
the receptacle. From one or more of these parts the class is 
formed ; from others, the order and the genus. The species 
is determined by the other parts of the plant ; the root, stem, 
leaves, &c. 

The word calyx is of Greek origin, and signifies a cover ; 
it is used to express the leaf, or leaves, usually growing im- 
mediately under the flower, and enclosing it while in bud. Its 
office is to protect the tenderer parts, and more particularly 
such as are essential to the production of fruit. It varies in 
situation, and yet more in form; and, according to these 
variations, is differently named, though the word calyx applies 
to them all. The most common of all its varieties is the 
perianth, so called from two Greek words, signifying around 
the flower. Its colour is most commonly, but not invariably, 
green. 

Corolla is the diminutive of the Latin word corona^ a crown, 
and is applied to that part commonly termed the flower, often 
so beautifully coloured, and more, perhaps, than any other 
part of a plant, subject to the dominion of Fancy. It would 
seem as though Nature had given the corolla more particularly 
in charge of this playful goddess. It is generally believed 
that the corolla, like the calyx, is intended as a protection to 
the internal parts of the flower ; but this is like giving one 
infant to the care of another. The corolla is almost always 
of a delicate texture, in many cases so frail that a breath will 
destroy or dismiss it from its station; it is itself in need of 
protection, and, most commonly, very unfit to bestow it. 
This lovely portion of the flower has many uses more con- 
sistent with its delicacy, than that of life-guardsman. It were 
enough were it destined only to give pleasure ; and, not to 
speak of the many chemical and medical uses, it frequently 
lodges firagrant oils, which, scattering volatile particles in the 
air, perfume the atmosphere around, and afford an additional 
pleasure to those who come to gaze upon its 
beauty. The corolla is sometimes composed of 
one piece, sometimes of several pieces ; these 
are named petals, from a Greek word signifying 
to expand ; and, according to their number, it is 
styled monopetalous, one-petaled; dipetalous, 
two-petaled; tripetalous, three-petaled ; tetra- 
petalous, four-petaled ; pentapetalous, five-pe- 
taled ; or polypetalous, many-petaled. (.y%. 92. 
a, monopetalous corolla; b, the perianth.) 

Old authors used the word leaves as well to express the 
divisions of the corolla and calyx, as the leaves commonly so 




2S2 Introductmy View of the 

called. Misled by this confusion of terms, Addison, who was 
probably unacquainted with the flower described by Virgil, 
represents the Italian aster (^'ster ^melius) as a purple busli, 
with yellow flowers, instead of telling us that the flower had 
a yellow disk and purple rays. 

" Aureus ipse ; sed in foliis, quae plurima circum 
Funduntur, violae sublucet purpura nigrae." 

Virgil, Georgia 4. 

" The flower itself is of a golden hue. 
The leaves inclining to a darker blue ; 
The leaves shoot thick about the root, and grow 
Into a bush, and shade the turf below." 

Addison. 

Dryden falls into the same error : — 

" A flower there is that grows in meadow ground, 
Amellus called, and easy to be found ; 
For from one root the rising stem bestows 
A wood of leaves and violet-purple boughs. 
The flower itself is glorious to behold. 
And shines on altars like refulgent gold." 

We doubt whether the plant would very easily be found by 
this description, or any plant that should correspond with it. 
Still further to avoid any confusion of this sort, by using 
terms as distinct as possible, some modern botanists have 
substituted the word sepal for the leaves of the calyx, from 
sepire, to surround or hedge in. 

The pistil {Jig, 93.) usually occupies the centre of the 
flower. It is composed of three parts: 1. the ger- 
men («), which is the rudiment of the fruit; 2. the 
style (^), a tubular column proceeding from the ger- 
men ; and 3. the stigma {c\ or summit, which crowns 
the style. 

The stigma is, more or less, covered with a glutinous 
moisture : it varies considerably in form ; and that which is 
called the simple stigma, having no form to distinguish it from 
the top of the style, might conveniently be called the summit ; 
but the two words are generally used indiscriminately. 
5^ The stamen^ also, {Jig. 94.) is composed of three 

*^ parts: 1. the filament, or thread (fl), which is affixed 
to some part of the flower, mostly to the corolla, 
calyx, or receptacle; 2. the anther (Z>), which is sup- 

'^ ported by the filament, and is a little bag, or case, 
containing the third part, which is called the pollen (c). 
This last is apparently a fine meal ; but, when seen through 
a microscope, every particle appears a little bag, containing 




Lmtiean System of Plants, ^3S 

a meal yet finer. As the pollen ripens, it swells the anthers, 
which at last open, and shed it upon the stigma. It adheres 
to that part by the glutinous moisture before mentioned, and, 
by means of the hollow style which connects it with the ger- 
men, feeds the young fruit until it has attained its full growth. 
Thus sits the style upon the seeds, like the hen bird upon her 
eggs ; while the stamen, like a tender mate, supplies her with 
food. 

The pistil and stamen are the most essential parts of a 
flower, since, without them, no fruit can be produced. The 
corolla or the calyx may be wanting, and yet the flower will 
be termed perfect, because the absence of those parts is no 
obstacle to reproduction. Even the style and the filament 
may be absent, without preventing the formation or ripening 
of the fruit ; and there are many flowers which have the stamen 
sitting close to the corolla, &c., without a filament, and the 
stigma to the germen without a style; but the anther, the 
germen, and the stigma are essential. 

The seed is contained in the pericarp, or seed-vessel, which 
is the germen (before described as a part of the pistil) when 
grown to maturity. The name of the seed-vessel varies 
according to its form, substance, &c. ; but the word pericarp 
a Word of Greek origin, which signifies around the seed, is 
applicable to all its varieties. 

The receptacle is the base, or medium, which connects the 
©ther parts of the fructification. 

Of the varieties of all these parts I shall say more here- 
after. 

Of the twenty-four classes into which the vegetable king- 
dom is divided, the first ten rest solely on the number of 
stamens contained in their flowers ; and proceed without in- 
terruption, the number of the class corresponding with that of 
the stamens. They are distinguished by the Greek numbers 
prefixed to the word andria, which is also of Greek origin, 
and signifies a husband, the stamen being considered the father 
of the fruit; while the pistil, which nourishes it in her 
bosom, being looked upon as the mother, is expressed by the 
word gynia^ meaning a wife. By the number of 
the latter, the orders of these classes are distin- 
guished. Thus, the first class, Monandria, is 
divided into two orders, Monogynia and Digy- 
nia; in other words, those flowers which have 
but one stamen are divided into two sets ; those 
which have one pistil {Jig.95. a\ and those which 
have two {b) ; we should rather say styles, for 
it fi-equently "happens that they are multiplied, while the germ'

2S4 Introductai^ View of tlie 

remains single. It is, therefore, from the styles, at their base, 
that the number is reckoned, or, where the style is wanting, 
from the stigmas. 

Of the class Monandria, this country furnishes examples of 
four genera in the first order, and one in the second. These 
are all marsh plants, and chiefly affecting the sea coast ; they 
are neither among the handsomest nor the most valuable of 
our native plants. One or two species are, I believe, of some 
chemical importance ; and, from some foreign genera of this 
class, we obtain ginger, cardamoms, turmeric, arrow-root*, 
and, as the catalogue informs us, (and the reader will be sur- 
prised to hear it,) opera girls ! (Mantisia saltatoria) from the East 
Indies. If the reader have any doubt of the fact, let him pro- 
ceed forthwith to the botanic garden at Cambridge, where he 
may see a specimen of each ; if, indeed, the saltatory tenden- 
cies of the latter have admitted of its remaining stationary for 
any length of time. It must be acknowledged that some of 
our English names are such as might startle a foreigner. 
Thus we furnish our gardens and green-houses with Old 
Mens' Heads and Lady's Fingers, Cats' Tails and Dogs' 
Tongues, Infernal Figs and Indian Gods. Our gardeners 
are, however, more considerate than might be supposed. If 
they grow Naked Ladies, they also grow Lady's Smocks, 
Lady's Mantles, Lady's Slippers, and Blue Bonnets ; nor do 
they forget to provide Lady's Combs, and a crop of Looking- 
glasses. If they have the Tooth-ache tree, they also culti- 
vate Patience; though they have Double Tongues, they are 
well supplied with Honesty to counteract them. In opposition 
to the Melancholy tree, they exhibit True Love, Heart's Ease, 
and Traveller's Joy ; and though they deny not 
their London Pride, they are very careful to 
preserve the Humble Plant as an example. 

The second class, Diandria, isdivided into three 
orders; Monogynia (y%-. 96. a\ Digynia (i), 
Trigynia (c) ; one, two, and three styled. It is 
to be observed that, in the first twenty classes, 
the presence of the pistil is essential ; if that is 
wanting, the plant must belong to one or other of 
the latter classes, as will be more fully explained 
in its proper place. 

The first order of the second class contains ten 
British genera (that is, ten genera, of which some 

? So named from the Indians using its juice as a remedy for wounds 
inflicted by poisoned arrows. It is also considered an excellent remedy for 
the stings of venomous insects, so prevalent in hot climates. 





Linnean Si/stem of Planis, 235 

of the species are British) ; of the second order we have but 
one genus ; and of the third, not any example. 

To the first order belong the ash tree, and that beautiful 
spear-leaved * shrub called the Privet (Jg, 97.), bearing 
thyrses of white flowers in the summer, and bitter black berries 
in the winter. One of the pret- ^^ ^7 

tiest of the flowers that ^^^% 

" Do paint the meadows with delight,'* 

in the months of May and June, 
is a species of Veronica, another 
genus of this order, supposed to 
derive its name from the saint so 
called. This plant, commonly 
called the Germander Speedwell, 
grows plentifully in hedges, mea- 
dows, &c. ; and, as it will bear 
removal when in flower, if care- 
fully uprooted, may be trans- 
ferred to a garden-pot, and admired at leisure. Another genus 
of the ten afore-mentioned is the Circae'ff, or Enchanter's 
Nightshade, named from the enchantress Circe, and formerly 
believed to be a preservative against every species of magical 
incantation ; alike defying the power of sorcerers, witches, 
demons, and evil spirits, of every denomination. One of the 
species is common in moist and shady situations ; and, to say 
nothing of the extraordinary virtues attributed to it, is well 
worth seeking for its delicate and elegant appearance ; the 
stem and leaves are frequently tinged, more or less, with a 
bright red, contrasting beautifully with the two little white, or 
pale rose-tinged, petals. 

Among foreigners of the same class and order, we may 
reckon some of our most popular favourites ; as the jasmines 
and the lilac trees ; the snowdrop tree, now become a general 
tenant of the English shrubbery ; rosemary, which, though not 
a native, has been found, for many years past, in every village 
garden ; sage, familiar to us all from its culinary uses ; and the 
olive, the tree presented to the city of Athens by the goddess 
of wisdom, and considered, not only as the emblem, but the 
maker, of peace, since it has been asserted that a few drops of 
its oil will calm the turbulent ocean itself. Even the rapacity 
of the plague may be checked, it is said, by anointing the body 
with olive oil, which secures it from the infection of that fierce 
disease, as well as of the yellow fever. It is also reputed as a

cure for the venomous bite of the viper ; and is a powerful 
antidote to various poisons. Nor let us forget the fruit itself, 
which, in its preserved state, is brought to table ; not only ta 
make a part of the dessert ; not only, (as some suppose), to be 
eaten, or to heighten the flavour of wine ; but also to introduce 
that never-failing observation, that a taste for olives is always 
an acquired one. Notwithstanding my own personal expe- 
rience, however, I must venture to doubt this axiom, having 
seen a whole family of children, and even infants in arms, eat 
them as readily as though they had been sweet plums. 

To look back, for a moment, to the jasmine. It is well 
known that the Italians obtain a perfume from its flowers, by 
a very easy process : soaking a quantity of cotton wool in some 
scentless oil, they put it into glass vessels, in alternate layers 
with the jasmine flowers ; and, after a few days, squeeze the oil 
from the wool, and put it into bottles for use ; the perfume 
being communicated by that simple means. But it would seem 
that the Italians derive little gratification from this result; for 
we are told that they (the Romans, at least) have a perfect 
abhorrence of perfumes; and avoid a person scented with 
attar of roses, with every appearance of disgust. Sir Jamesr 
Edward Smith, in his Continental Tour^ speaking of the 
Borghese chapel at Rome, says that one of the popes having 
dreamed, in the month of August, of a fall of snow, and find- 
ing that it actually had fallen at that season, on a certain hill, 
built a chapel on the spot; and, in commemoration of the 
dream, on the anniversary of the day, caused an artificial snow 
to be showered upon the congregation there assembled, during 
the whole of the service. This artificial snow was composed 
of the beautiful and fragrant flowers of the white jasmine ; and 
(can we believe it?) the ladies abstained from visiting the 
chapel on that occasion, from their horror of this sweet 
perfume. 

The third order of the class Diandria supplies us with 
pepper, no unimportant article of trade. In some years, above 
six million pounds' weight of the berries of the Piper nigrum 
(black pepper) have been sold at the East India Company's 
sales ; of which, seven or eight hundred thousand have been 
retained for home consumption. 

The third class, Triandria, also comprises three orders; 
Monogynia, Digynia, and Trigynia. Of the first are many 
very handsome genera, chiefly bulbous-rooted ; the Cri^cusj 
/ris, /'xia, Morcea, Gladiolus, Antholyza, &c. &c. ; but the 
most interesting plant of this order is the Cyperus Papyrus Li 
(or Papyrus antiqu6rum JVilld.), the celebrated Egyptian plant 
which furnished the scliolars of antiquity with writing-papei*. 



Linnean System of Plants, 237 

The second order of the class Triandria is rich in invaluable 
productions. The plants of this order are not remarkably 
handsome ; but they are to mankind, to Europeans, at least, 
the very " staff of life." It is chiefly composed of the grasses, 
of which there are many of incalculable utility, not only to 
mankind but to beast-kind ; but the greatest treasure of its 
wealth is corn. Wheat, rye, oats, and barley, all belong to 
this order. The grasses are very numerous ; and, from the 
smallness of their parts, and other causes, are, in many in- 
stances, rather difficult to distinguish, but they are well worth 
all the time and attention they demand. In a space not larger 
than a grain of rice, we may distinguish six or seven florets 
enclosed by a two-leaved calyx : eiich floret composed of a 
corolla in two parts ; of three filaments, with anthers rather 
large in proportion with the other parts ; and the germ, with 
its two styles and stigmas. Yet, notwithstanding their dimi- 
nutive size (frequently not distinguishable without a mag- 
nifier), these stigmas are often finely feathered with compound 
feathers, as beautifully formed, and complete in every respect, 
as it is possible for any feather to be. The elegance of form, 
and delicate combinations of colour, are, in many species, 
truly admirable. Among them may be instanced one of the 
commonest and most generally known of all the grasses, the 
rye-grass (Zolium perenne). The meadow soft-grass (i/olcus 
lanatus) has beautiful downy leaves, like velvet to the touch, 
with a compound spike of flowers, delicately variegated with 
pink and pale green. Another of this genus, H. arenaceus, is 
both elegant and majestic. I have seen this grass 6 ft. high, 
with leaves 2 ft. long, and more than 1 in. wide ; with its 
panicle of flowers gently drooping to one side, at least 1 ft. 
6 in. in length, and so finely polished, that, but for their green 
colour, we might think it was composed of silver oats. Yet it is 
not green ; neither is it white, nor gold-colour, nor purple, but 
it is a union of all these : it is the offspring of silver and of 
gold, of the amethyst and the emerald. It is, indeed, very 
variable; but, in the full pride of its beauty, this grass is truly 
magnificent. The light purple pyramids that quiver in every 
field and meadow, must be well known to every reader. In 
fine, the student who has leisure to investigate their beauties, 
will find the family of grasses peculiarly interesting, and much, 
more various and beautiful than, from the apparent homeliness 
of many, they might be supposed to be. Our gratitude is yet 
further claimed by this class and order, for its production of 
the sugar-cane, a plant which many persons will value no less 
than wheat itself.

Having furnished so many handsome plants in the first 
order, and useful ones in the second, the class Triandria seeks

let us also repose ; for we have not room to go through another

Art. VIII. The Jussieuean^ or Natural, System of Plants, 
{Continued from p. 144.) 

[We have already noticed the importance of Cruciferae to 
mankind, and the singularity of its botanical characters. In 
the general view which we are now giving of the groups into 
which plants are thrown by the natural system, we do not 
stop to render familiar to the learner the singular characters 
alluded to ; because we know that we cannot do this with 
proper effect, till he has made himself master of the details 
which will be given by Miss Kent, in illustration of the Lin- 
nean system. By the time that we have got through our 
general view of the groups of plants. Miss Kent will be con- 
siderably advanced in her illustrations, and the student will 
then know enough of vegetable anatomy to follow us through 
scientific definitions of the different orders and tribes, and 
which definitions we intend to accompany by figures of the 
types of all the genera.] 

The whole order of CruciferaB is preeminently Euro- 
pean; 166 species are found in the north and middle of 
Europe, and 178 on the sea-shores of the Mediterranean; 
45 are found between Mogadore and Alexandria; 184- in 
the countries of the East, that is to say, Syria, Asia Minor, 
Tauria, and Persia; 99 in Siberia; 35 in China, Japan, 
and India; 16 in New Holland and the South Sea islands; 
6 in the Mauritius and adjacent countries ; 70 at the Cape ; 
9 in the Canaries; 2 in Saint Helena; 2 in the West 
Indies; 4-1 in South America ; 48 in North America; 5 in 
Kamtchatka and the bordering islands ; and finally, S5 are 
common to several parts of the globe. From this it appears 
that there are about 100 species in the southern hemisphere, 
and about 800 in the northern : or, if they are considered with 
reference to the zones of temperature, 205 are natives of the 
frigid zone of the northern hemisphere i 30 of the whole of 
the tropics ; 548 of the temperate zone of the northern hemi- 
sphere ; and 86 of the southern. The forty-first degree of 



The Jussieuean, or Natural^ System of Plants, 239 

north latitude may be convsidered the equatorial line of Cru- 
ciferae, about half being found on one side of it, and half on 
the other. Their station is very variable; many inhabit 
open sandy places, some form the vegetation about the limits 
of the perpetual snows of lofty mountains, and many follow 
the footsteps of man through all parts of the world. 

The useful qualities of the turnip, the radish, the rape, and 
the cabbage, and its multiform varieties, are all well known. 
The greater part of the order consists of plants possessing 
high antiscorbutic powers. These appear to depend upon a 
certain acrid volatile oily principle, the chemical nature of 
which is imperfectly known. It is particularly abundant in 
the seeds of mustard, the roots of horseradish, and the 
leaves of iepidium latifolium, which last exercise a violent 
influence upon the organs of digestion. The same sort of 
acrimony, but in less degree, is found in the herbage of the 
scurvygrass and the roots of the radish, which act much 
more mildly when taken inwardly ; thus, when any cruciferous 
plants are found to be eatable, either from culture or other 
circumstances, it is to be understood to depend upon a reduc- 
tion of this acrid principle. The exciting powers of this prin- 
ciple are what render the horseradish, the scurvygrass, and 
others, so remarkably useful as antiscorbutics. Plants of this 
order are also believed to possess diuretic and diaphoretic pro- 
perties. It is to be remarked that Cruciferae are always eat- 
able when their texture is succulent and watery, as in the roots 
of the radish and turnip, and in the leaves of the cabbage tribe 
A further diminution of the acrid principle is produced by 
blanching. Cruciferae are said to possess a greater share of 
azote than any other tribe of plants ,' as is apparent in their 
fetid smell when fermented. The embryos of all the order 
abound in oil, whence many species are employed with much 
advantage for expressing, either for the table or for feeding 
lamps. Some of the species are extremely beautiful and fra- 
grant, as the stocks, the gillyflowers, the hesperides, the candy- 
tufts, and many others. The hutchinsias, drabas, cardamines, 
&C.J are among the most interesting of alpine plants.

Art. IX, NotulcB Botanicce. By G. A. Walker Arnott, Esq, 

EriSphorvm. — Having lately received specimens of the 
Eriophorum pub^scens {Jig. 98. a) of Sir J. E. Smithes 
English Flora, from Mr. Baird, found in the bog at Lammer- 
ton Toll, three miles west of Berwick, I beg to send you 
the following remarks : — 

Smith, although he has distinguished this species (whe- 
ther rightly or not I shall not here give my opinion) from 
E. polystachyon {b), and added the synonym of Poiteau 
and Turpin (FL Par,, t. 51.), does not seem to have been 



Notulce Botanicce, 



241 




I 



aware that it is a generally diffused, and, consequently, 
an often described species. 
In Scotland it is, I believe, 
not uncommon; but I state 
this with doubt, as, trusting to 
procure specimens of E. poly- 
stachyon, a plant supposed 
very common (and with which 
I also had confounded E. pu- 
bescens), whenever 1 chose, 
for my herbarium, I have 
delayed from day to day, and 
year to year, and can only, at 
this moment, boast of a few 
miserable morceaux ; some of 
which, however, are E. pubescens. In England it has been 
found on Wallington Moors by Mr. Trevyllian, and indicated 
by him there under the name of E. gracile. From the neigh- 
bourhood of Paris 1 have not yet received it, but I possess it 
from Switzerland, under the name of E. latifolium ; and, from 
the description (pedunculis scabris) given by Schrader and all 
foreign botanists, including Roemer and Schultes, as well as 
Sprengel's Systema Vegetabilium, that Swiss specimen appears 
rightly named ; whence we must transfer the synonym of the 
English Flora to E. pubescens, or rather we must adopt for 
the species the name of E, latifolium, and reduce under it the 
E. pubescens of Smith. From Canada I have also received a 
specimen, under the name of E. angustif 61ium Pursh ; but, as 
I have at present no opportunity of examining the specimen 
of that author, I dare not cite that as a synonym. 

With regard to E. gracile, it is always described with, and 
ought to be readily distinguished by, the triangular leaves. I 
have not, however, been so fortunate hitherto as to receive 
from any correspondent abroad the plant which foreign au- 
thors have described under that name, or its synonym E. tri- 
quetrum ; but in the British specimens which I have examined, 
found by Mr. G. Don on Ben Lawers, the leaves are de- 
cidedly, particularly the radical ones, plane at the base, and 
only triangular in their upper half; and, from the whole habit, 
I feel inclined to refer it to E. latifolium (E. pubescens Sm,). 

It is, however, but justice to Dr. Smith, here to state that 
I have seen neither Mr, Bruce's nor Mr. Holmes's specimens, 
and that even the plant which I have received from Mr. Baird, 
and which accords tolerably well with Smith's specific cha- 
racter (he says the peduncles are dowm/s in my specimen they 
are rather covered with close set, somewhat rigid, setulse, or 



242 TJie Oak Tree, considered 

bristles), does not by any, means agree with his lengthened 
description, when he says that these peduncles are clothed 
with^w^ silky hairs. My plant is certainly E. latifolium ; and 
should I have made an error in supposing it to be Dr. Smith's 
E, pubescens, I hope some of your readers will correct me, 
and put into my possession the true plant of the English 
Flora, 

I can scarcely pass over in this place the E. angustifolium. 
This has the leaves almost linear, and I feel doubtful about 
its being so common as is usually thought, most specimens 
I have seen under that name being E. polystachyon. The 
synonym of Vaillant [FL Par., t. 16. f. ].)/or E. Vaillant« 
Poiteau and Turpin {FL Par., t. 52.), has been cited under it 
by Sir James; and of that plant Merat says the leaves are 
triangular, but Gaudin that they are somewhat broad and 
carinate; and in my specimens from Paris, given me by M. 
Adolphe Brongniart, the leaves are lanceolate, and only tri- 
angular towards their points. Hence, as the peduncles are 
perfectly glabrous, I would refer it to E. polystachyon. It is, 
however, I allow, a remarkable variety, as the lower or broad 
part of the leaf appears complicate or folded together; a cir- 
cumstance that may have led some botanists to suppose that 
the base was itself triangular. 

Most foreign botanists make but two species of E. angusti- 
folium, latifolium, and polystachyon, and distinguish them by 
the smooth or scabrous peduncles. E. gracile is separated 
from them by its filiform and triangular leaves, erect spikes, 
and hirsute peduncles; but, in my opinion, it bears precisely 
the same relation to E. angustifolium that E. latifolium does 
to E. polystachyon.

Art. X. The principal Forest Trees of Europe, considered as 
Elements of Landscape. By J. G. Strutt, Esq. ^ 

(Continued from p. 42.) 

In my former communication, I endeavoured to give your 
readers an idea of the general figure and character of the oak, 
with respect to pictorial effect in landscape, whether considered 
as a solitary object to adorn the foreground, or as united into 
groups, or as the extensive line of a distant forest. I then 
found it sufficient to arrange my subject in three principal 
divisions, the stem, the limbs, and the masses of foliage ; I 



as an Element of Landscape, 24- 3 

must now proceed to exhibit the more minute peculiari- 
ties and distinctions of the oak, the character of its spray, the 
ramification of its branches, and the peculiar and individual 
appearance of its foliage. With respect to the first of these 
heads, I cannot do better than quote the remarks of Gilpin. 
*' In the spray of trees," he observes, " nature seems to ob- 
serve one simple principle ; which is, that the mode of growth 
in the spray corresponds exactly with that of the larger branches, 
of which, indeed, the spray is the origin. Thus the oak di- 
vides his boughs from the stem more horizontally than most 
other deciduous trees. The spray makes exactly in miniature 
the same appearance. It breaks out in right angles, or in 
angles that are nearly so ; forming its shoots commonly in 
short lines: the second year's shoot usually taking some 
direction contrary to that of the first. Thus the rudiments 
are laid of that abrupt mode of ramification, for which the 
oak is remarkable. When two shoots spring from the same 
knot, they are commonly of unequal length ; and one with 
large strides generally takes the lead. Very often, also, three 
shoots, and sometimes four, spring from the same knot. Hence 
the spray of the oak becomes thick, close, and interwoven ; so 
that, at a little distance, it has a full rich appearance, and 
more of the picturesque roughness than we observe in the spray 
of any other tree. The spray of the oak also generally springs 
in such directions as give its branches that horizontal appear- 
ance which they generally assume." 




In the above illustration {Jig, 99.) it will be seen that the 
spray seldom shoots from the lower or underside of the 
branches, which, added to the roughness and strength of their 
component parts, enables the branches to stretch out and 
maintain their horizontal position, not unfrequently even to 



21.4. 



The Oak Trce^ considered 



the very last twig ; although sometimes, from the great weight 
of foliage, and perhaps from some difference in the species 
of the tree, an oak may be found with pendent boughs. 

The ramification of trees is of great importance to the 
painter. As well, it has been observed, might an artist attempt 
to delineate the figure of a Hercules, without expressing any 
of the muscles in his body, as to give the drawing of an oak 
tree without a scientific regard to the anatomy of its form, in 
a just display of the various angles and tortuous irregularities 
of its branches. The accompanying example {Jig. 100.) is 
sketched from the denuded boughs, to give a more uninter-* 
rupted view of then- peculiar character. 




The foliage of the oak is particularly suited to the pencil. 
In those portions which are brought nearer to the sight, the 
form of the individual leaves [fg, 101. a) may here and there 
be expressed, as shown in the sketch, which also exhibits what 
is technically called the touch {b) necessary to express its 
character as it recedes from the eye. 

The colouring of the oak, and, indeed, of all natural objects 
connected with landscape, admits of so great a variety, that it 
is impossible to give any precise rules on the subject. A dili- 
gent attention to nature will alone, in this respect, avail : for, 
besides the ordinary varieties induced by change of season, from 
the tender and emerald hues of spring to the deeper bloom of 
summer, and the rich and glowing tints of autumn, an astonish- 
ing diversity of colour is effected by accidental circumstances,. 



as an Element of Landscape, 245 

dependent on the different aspects of morning, noon, and even- 
ing ; on sun and on shade ; on the colours of the sky and the 



101 




clouds ; on the clearness or haziness of the atmosphere, and its 
consequent powers of refraction ; on opposition of colour ; on 
the situation of the spectator ; and on many other contingen- 
cies, all independent of the local colour of the object, yet all 
strongly affecting it. It is impossible, therefore, I repeat, to 
give, in any written description, with tolerable conciseness, 
sufficient instruction for selecting the colours necessary to 
depict these objects, so constantly varying in their hues. A 
few simple tints on the pallette, and an hour's study in the 
forest, will be more instructive than a volume of remarks. 
The attention and minuteness with which a lover of nature 
will examine a favourite object, and the truth with which he 
will consequently, be enabled to describe it, are so strongly 
evidenced in the following passage, extracted from the works 
of the amiable writer before quoted, that I shall make no 
apology for transcribing the whole passage : — "I have often 
stood,'' says he, " with admiration before an old forest oak, 
examining the various tints which have enriched its furrowed 
stem. The genuine bark of an oak is of an ash colour, though 
it is difficult to distinguish any part of it from the mosses that 
overspread it; for no oak, I suppose, was ever without a 
greater or less proportion of these picturesque appendages. 
The lower parts, about the roots, are often possessed by that 
green, velvet moss, which, in a still greater degree, commonly 
occupies the bole of the beech, though the beauty and bril- 
liancy of it lose much when in decay. As the trunk rises, 
you see the brimstone colour taking possession in patches. 
Of this there are two principal kinds; a smooth sort, w^hich. 
spreads like a scurf over the laark ; and a rougher sort, which 
hangs in little rich knots and fringes. I call it a brimstone 
hue by way of general distinction, but it sometimes inclines 
to an olive, and sometimes to a light green. Intermixed with 



246 The Oak Trce^ C07iside7'ed 

these mosses you often find a species almost perfectly white. 
Before I was acquainted with it, I have sometimes thought 
the tree white-washed. Here and there, a touch of it gives a 
lustre to the trunk, and has its effect : yet, on the whole, it is 
a nuisance ; for, as it generally begins to thrive when the other 
mosses begin to wither (as if the decaying bark were its 
proper nutriment), it is rarely accompanied with any of the 
more beautiful species of its kind; and, when thus unsup- 
ported, it always disgusts. This white moss, by the way, is 
esteemed a certain mark of age, and when it prevails in any 
degree, is a clear indication that the vigour of the tree is de- 
clining. We find, also, another species of moss, of a dark 
brown colour, inclining nearly to black ; another of an ashy 
colour; and another of a dingy yellow. We may observe 
also touches of red, and sometimes, but rarely, a bright yel- 
low, which is like a gleam of sunshine ; and in many trees you 
will see one species growing upon another, the knotted brim- 
stone-coloured fringe clinging to a lighter species, or the 
black softening into red. All these excrescences, under what- 
ever names distinguished, add a great richness to trees ; and 
when they are blended harmoniously, as is generally the case, 
the rough and furrowed trunk of an old oak, adorned with 
these pleasing appendages, is an object which will long detain 
the picturesque eye." 

As it is thus more particularly in old age that the oak is 
valuable to the painter, we shall conclude the present article 
with a description of the Cowthorpe oak, extracted from the 
Sylva Britamiica, together with a portrait of the tree from a 
drawing made upon the spot. {Jig, 102.) 

This gigantic and venerable tree stands on the extremity 
of the village of Cowthorpe, near Wetherby, in Yorkshire, in 
a retired field, sheltered on one side by the ancient church 
belonging to the place, and on another by a farm-house, the 
rural occupations of which exactly accord with the character 
of the oak, whose aged arms are extended towards it with a 
peculiar air of rustic vigour, retained even in decay ; like some 
aged peasant, whose toil-worn limbs still give evidence of 
the strength which enabled him to acquit himself of the labours 
of his youth. It is mentioned by the late Dr. Hunter, in his 
edition of Evelyn's Sylva, in the following note on a passage 
respecting the extraordinary size of an oak in Sheffield Park : 
" Neither this, nor any of the oaks mentioned by Mr. Evelyn, 
bears any proportion to one now growing at Cowthorpe. The 
dimensions are almost incredible. Within three feet of the 
ground it measures sixteen yards, and close by the ground 
twenty-six yards. Its height, in its present ruinous state ( 1 776), 



as an Element of Landscape, 



247 



is almost eighty-five feet, and its principal limb extends six- 
teen yards from the bole. Throughout the whole tree the 




foliage is extremely thin, so that the anatomy of the ancient 
branches may be distinctly seen in the height of summer. 
When compared to this, all other trees are but children of 
the forest." (Book iii. p. 500.) 

This description so nearly answers to the present state of 
the tree, that it does not appear to have suffered any consider- 
able deprivation since the above period. In girth, indeed, it 
is inferior to the magnificent remains of the oak in Salcey 
Forest ; but, altogether, it is a noble and imposing ruin, on 
which it is impossible to look without entering into the wish 
suggested to an ingenious writer by the sight of a similar 
object, and poetically expressed in the following lines : — 

" When the huge trunk, whose bare and forked arms 
Pierced the mid sky, now prone, shall bud no more. 
Still let the massy ruin, like the bones 
Of some majestic hero, be preserved 
Unviolated and revered ; — 
Whilst the grey father of the vale, at eve

The botanical Characters of the Common Oak are as follows: 
Quercus {qiier, fine, ctiez, tree, Celtic) i?obur (name given by 
the Romans to the hardest kind of oak), the Hard, or Com- 
mon, Oak (fg. 103.), belongs

Polyandria of Z/;?., and to the nat. 
ord. Amentacese ofjussieu. The 
generic character is as follows; 
and if the inexperienced botanist 
will take the trouble, in this and 
in future examples, of comparing 
the description with the figure, 
and referring from the one to the 
other, letter by letter, he will 
gradually initiate himself in the 
scientific part of botany.

In the prosecution of a science of investigation like geology, 
a division of labour tends in no slight degree towards its rapid 
advancement. V^e are happy to witness so many labourers 
in the field, each bringing in, by turns, some useful contribu- 
tion to swell the vast store of accumulated information. During 
the last few years, a prodigious accession has thus been made 
to our stock of geological knowledge, and with it, it is pre- 
sumed, has arisen a corresponding aptitude for its right appli- 
cation. This increasing tendency was at first derived from the 
exertions of an extremely limited number of enquirers ; subse- 
quently, from the combined efforts of the many whose energy 
was excited by the attractive nature of the science, and by the 
splendid discoveries of their predecessors. 

When we look at the state of English geology now, en- 
nobled by the collateral sciences, and almost essential to a 
liberal education, we are led to forget that it is a science of 
our own times, that most of its earliest professors are yet 
amongst us. We could refer to the period in bur remem- 
brance, and that at no very distant day, when, indeed, this 
department of practical knowledge was in very few hands, and 
under circumstances of discouragement ; when it was confined 
almost to a solitary individual, of obscure origin, of slender 
resources, and inadequate patronage, who, after twenty years 
of laborious research, produced the first delineation of the 
great geological features of our island. Even prior to this

250 Marthas Geological Memoir, and 

event, which cannot but be viewed as an interesting era in the 
history of this branch of natural science, a considerable mass 
of information was acquired by many naturalists, who entered 
with avidity into a pursuit which combined the charms of 
novelty and interesting discovery with the substantial advan- 
tages of general utility. On all sides, fresh objects of wonder 
and speculation presented themselves. Entire races of animals, 
of unknown foims and singular adaptation, inhabitants of a 
former world, but overwhelmed beneath its ruins, were found 
to cover the earth with their remains, and were then first sub- 
jected to the scrutiny of science. Amongst these were some 
that could be recognised as resembling tribes peculiar to hot 
climates, and they were found surrounded with the relics of 
tropical vegetation, with the palms, the cacti, the arborescent 
ferns, and gigantic reeds of warm regions, all attesting the 
changes which our planet had undergone. As the enquiry 
proceeded, it became apparent that a degree of regularity 
existed in these deposits, and that certain tribes or genera of 
animals occupied particular members of the series of rocks. 
Hence it was naturally suggested that these organic bodies 
might be employed as indices of the several rocks or beds to 
which they respectively appertained : and their application has 
proved of the utmost value, as permanent tests in identifying 
the strata, when mineralogical characters are altogether un- 
availing, or, at least, are doubtful evidence. The discovery of 
these indices to the strata, led to a demonstration of the extent 
and continuity of the various groups of which they are com- 
prised, and thence to defining with precision the boundaries 
of each description of rock, of earth, clay, or sand, and to 
determining the superficial areas they successively occupied 
after they rose to the surface. This extended acquaintance 
with the geographical position of rocks, was accompanied by 
a more accurate knowledge of their contents, as applicable to 
the economy of man. We were thus enabled to avail our- 
selves, with greater certainty, of the inestimable resources 
contained within the bowels of the earth, and to avoid expenses 
in useless pursuit of objects out of their natural limits. We 
were also reasonably led to infer that the ultimate result of an 
elaborate survey of the earth, if that process is not the only 
one which conducts to a solution of the great problem, would 
at least furnish safer ground on which to erect a theory of its 
formation, and to speculate upon its antiquity, and the stupen- 
dous revolutions to which it has been subjected. Our progress 
towards the attainment of the latter objects, has apparently 
been much slower than our preliminary acquisition of the 
data. But instances are by no means rare, where a thorough 



Buckla7id's Fot-mation of the Valley of Kingsdere, 251 

acquaintance with the geological arrangement of a district, and 
a comparison with parallel cases elsewhere, have suggested 
reasonable explanations of local phenomena, which must 
otherwise have remained in their original obscurity. Amongst 
these may be classed Dr. Buckland's observations on valleys 
by elevation, and Mr. Martin's reasoning on the Weald de- 
nudation. In treating of geology generally, we shall probably 
take occasion to recount some instances where it has been 
safely applied as a science of induction. Meanwhile, we shall 
depart somewhat from the regular course we had prescribed, 
for the purpose of noticing the memoirs to which we have 
referred. 

The services of local observers are most usefully em- 
ployed when, like Mr. Martin and Mr. Mantell, they devote 
themselves to the examination of districts strictly within 
their immediate cognizance. The circumstances of resi- 
dence and protracted observation are by no means to be 
lightly estimated ; and when to these are added an extended 
acquaintance with distant parts of the geological system, and a 
habit of looking to general features rather than of scrutinising 
uncertain details, they confer upon this order of contributors 
an advantage which cannot be too highly appreciated. It is 
true, the great outlines of our strata have been traced, but 
some are less perfectly sketched than others. Many extensive 
intervals yet remain to be filled up, and an immense field is 
still unexplored with that degree of accuracy which is requi- 
site to the complete developement of all its parts, and a tho- 
rough knowledge of its internal structure. A long time will 
elapse ere the whole work shall have received these elaborate, 
yet not the less characteristic, touches, so as to exhibit the 
true features of our country. By the formation of local 
scientific institutions, by the establishment of provincial collec- 
tions of natural history, by the cooperation of numerous indivi- 
duals eminent for their earnest support of these enquiries, and, 
above all, by the concentration of its most distinguished advo- 
cates in the metropolitan society of geologists, the progress 
of this great undertaking will be rapidly accelerated. We 
need not add, that to contribute towards the same end, and to 
diffuse yet more widely a knowledge of this department of 
natural science, are among the leading objects of this Journal. 
The district which forms the subject of Mr. Martin's me- 
moir, is that portion of Sussex and Kent which retains its 
Saxon appellation of the Weald. This is a quarter so abound- 
ing in objects of peculiar interest, that it has previously 
occupied some of our most experienced geologists in investi- 
gating them. Possessing characters, in the arrangement and

composition of the strata comprised within its area, apparently 
anomalous, abundance of matter is afforded for speculation ; 
and the controversy which has been elicited by these seeming 
discrepancies, has occasioned much diligent research, and been 
the means of illustrating, with more than usual perspicuity, 
the geological details of this singular country. Messrs. Cony- 
beare and Phillips, in their Outlines of the Geology of England 
and Wales, Dr. Fitton and Mr. Webster in the Annals of Phi- 
losophy, Dr. Buckland and Messrs. Lyell and Murchison in 
the Transactions of the Geological Society, and Messrs. Man- 
tell and Martin in separate treatises, have severally contributed 
to elucidate the principal phenomena of the Weald. But the 
opposite opinions entertained by some of these writers, and 
the undecided state in which they finally left the nomenclature, 
after the "green sand" controversy, occasioned for a time 
some little embarrassment to the geological student, from 
which it is not, even now, very easy to be wholly free. These 
difficulties have partly originated in the deviations, to which 
allusion has been made, from the geological equivalents in 
other parts of the kingdom, and in the interposition of depo- 
sits, which, as far as we yet know, are peculiar to this district. 

Remembering that it is our province to render the matter 
brought before the general reader as intelligible as possible, a 
few explanatory illustrations of the ordinary arrangements of 
the strata, drawn, not from imaginary cases, but from authen- 
tic sources, will prepare the way for a better consideration of 
the Weald denudation. 

It need scarcely be premised, that the several masses, or 
deposits, of clay, sand, chalk, and rocks, which contain organic 
substances, appear in rotation upon the surface of our island, 
gradually emerging from beneath each other, in regular order, 
from east to west ; and that their truncated edges, particularly 
in the outcrops of the harder strata, are elevated so as common- 
ly to exhibit an abrupt escarpment towards the west, {fig, 105.)

The most westerly is here the lowest stratum in the series, 
and, of course, had priority of formation ; on the contrary, the 
highest, towards the east, is the most recent. Such is the 
prevailing order of the stratification, with reference to our own 
country ; and it is observed that this arrangement is never 
inverted : a never appears, for instance, in the situation of c, 
nor changes place with h» The relation of certain beds to each 
other being understood, and the position of any member of the 



Buckland*s Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere, 253 

series being determined, we are enabled, with facility, to trace 
the remainder. This rule is found to hold good in all practi- 
cal examinations of stratified districts. The dip^ or angle of 
inclination, is variable ; consequently, the surface, or the ex- 
posed area, of any stratum is greater or less, according to the 
angle that stratum forms with the horizontal plane. 

On examining any district composed of stratified rocks, and 
intersected by valleys, it is commonly seen that the opposite 
sides of those valleys exhibit corresponding strata, at elevations 
governed by the dip {Jig, 106. a a a). 



106 




Where the beds are arranged above each other in this paral- 
lel manner, they come under the denomination of conformable. 
Where horizontal or parallel masses are placed upon inclined 
strata, they are then stated to be unconformable. An example 
is here furnished {fig, 107.) from a part of the Bristol coal- 
field in Dr. Buckland's and Mr. Conybeare's section, repre- 
senting the new red sandstone and lias reposing upon the 
highly inclined coal measures. 

107 




Detached masses are frequently found capping the summits 
of hills. These are called outliers^ and are obviously the re- 
mains of beds whose intermediate parts are washed away, 
leaving insulated portions, like mighty landmarks, to denote 
the ancient extent of the strata. The intermediate spaces 
that have been laid bare or hollowed out by the action of 
water, are called valleys, or areas, oi denudation^ a phrase which 
appears to have originated with the late zealous geologist Mr. 
Farey. They are also styled valleys of erosion^ and these are 
represented in^. 108.

Outliers, of the description adverted to, appear on many of 
the hills which are situated in advance of the great escarpment 
of the oolite rocks. They may be denominated outliers by 
denudation. That of Dundry Hill {Jig, 109.), near Bristol, as

shown in Dr. Buckland^s and Mr. Conybeare's section, already 
referred to, is an excellent example. (See the Transactions of 
the Geological Society.) It also furnishes another instance of 
unconformable position, and shows that the inclined beds 
beneath must have been disturbed prior to the deposition of 
the superincumbent rocks. 

Another class Mr. Martin denominates outliers by protru- 
sion. In this case, the stratum having been disrupted, a por- 
tion is forced from its parallel and conformable position, so as 
to become an elevated mass, whose sides form a considerable 
angle with the direction of the original body whence it was

dislodged, {fig. 110.) Whether this protrusion be " effected by 
a separate and distinct propelling impulse, or simply by arrest, 
by the interposition of some opposing substance, during the 
subsidence of the main body, it is not now material to enquire." 
Amongst the variety of derangements of stratification, may 
be mentioned those by suhsideJiccy the sinking of certain parts

Btickland*s Formation of the Valley of Ki7igsclere, 255 

beneath the level of the main portion. In illustration is a 
sketch of the strata near the edge of the mineral district of 
Monmouthshire. {Jig. 111.) Accidents of this kind are more 
frequent near the outcrop of the strata than deeper in the 
interior. 

By elevatio7i^ where masses have been heaved upwards, ap- 
parently by internal force. (Jig, 112.) This species of dislo- 
cation does not appear to be of such common occurrence as 
that arising from partial subsidence. Under the description 
oi faults^ the subject of disturbance in the position of rocks 
wil], with propriety, be resumed. 



112 




113 



The softer and later-formed strata present fewer instances 
of disruption than the older and more indurated rocks, parti- 
cularly those containing the coal-measures, the carboniferous 
strata of some writers. The sections constructed by Professor 
Buckland and the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, to elucidate the 
geology of the district around Bristol, furnish interesting 
examples of every variety of arrangement ; and, by selecting 
our illustrations from these documents, we desire to manifest 
our respect for authorities so accurate, we had almost said, 
so indisputable. 

One of the simplest 
forms, occasioned by 
the disposition of the 
strata, and by which 
the external form of 
the earth is modified, 
is that arrangement de- 
nominated the saddle- 
shaded {Jig, 113.), in 
which the uplifted 
edges of the strata are 
piled against each other, forming a steep ridge, like the roof of a 
building. Our sketch shows the elevation of Black Down (b), 
part of the Mendip chain of hills, and 1092 feet above the 
ocean.

Our next figure (114.) is more complex. It represents a 
modification of the last, having the crest removed or scooped 
out, apparently by the subsequent agency of denudation, which 
process has laid bare some of the inferior beds. These upland 
valleys are of the class to which the name of i;aZ/«/5 of elevation 
has been assigned by Dr. Buckland, from the circumstance of 
the strata having been apparently heaved upwards by internal 
force, prior to the removal of the fractured materials in the 
cavity, and before the edges of the broken strata were rounded 
or modified by diluvial currents. 

In those which are simply valleys of denudation or erosion, 
the drainage passes longitudinally along their centres ; but in 
those of elevation, as will be more particularly described, the 
drainage is effected by lateral openings or fissures in their 
escarpments, forming transverse valleys, at right angles to the 
direction of the longitudinal valleys. 

The authors of the Outlines notice many instances of this 
configuration of surface, in the circuit of a few miles round 
Bristol.

The contour of this figure has a general resemblance to the 
arrangement of the Weald, with which it must be classed. 
The drawing of the latter is necessarily on a more distorted 
scale, as it comprises an 
extent of many miles. Many 
others which traverse the 
chalk range, in various parts 
of the island, are described 
to present a similar combin- 
ation of circumstances. 

In the masterly description of the south-western coal field 
of England, to which we have referred, it is shown that this 
district is made up of a number of basins or hollows of less or 
greater extent, accordingly as the undulations of the inclined 
strata are more or less rapid ; such strata dipping from every 
point in the circumference of each basin towards its centre. 
In their map of the district, the authors adopted a mode of 
describing the boundaries of these basins by what they term 



BticUand's Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere, 257 




116 




anticlirial lines {fig. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ An tictimi Line. 

116.), which define the ^^^"^^"^^ "^"^ <^^ 

saddles of the strata,, 

or the meeting at the^ 

surface of their vertical 

angles. 

It is observed, that sometimes these lines follow the crests of 
the chains of hills, as in fig, 113., and sometimes pass along 
the course of valleys as inyTg. 114.; the hills in the latter case 
being formed, not by the saddles of the strata, but by the 
escarpments cutting through them. In the map of the Weald 
denudation {fg. 127.) and of the Kingsclere valley [fg, 136.)j 
the anticlinal lines pass along the centre of those areas. 
It thus appears that the direction of these lines is governed, 
not by the present superficial elevations on the earth's surface, 
but by the points of intersection of the upraised edges of the 
strata, whether upon a ridge or in the eroded bottom of a 
valley. Tlie annexed group (^^. 1 1 7.) exhibits (at a and b) an 
instructive example of the opposite circumstances under which 
the anticlinal lines are sometimes disposed, and shows a section 
of the central deposit which those lines circumscribe. It con- 
sists of part of the Mendip Hills section.

the carboniferous rocks, seems to indicate a degree of flexibility 
in the materials, yielding to vast pressure, and mechanical force. 
The hypothesis of subsidence alone, appears inadequate to pro- 
duce the phenomena of curvature, so frequently witnessed in 
coal basins.

In strata of a much more recent date, the occasional basin" 
shaped arrangement is per- 
ceived. We might illustrate 
this by the well-known sec- 
tion of the basin of London , 
(Jig, 120.), as it is termed,^ 
and by that of Hampshire,' 
both of which are occupied with deposits of the most recent 
origin in our geological system. 

It has been observed that some of the ancient strata exhi- 
bit marks of greater disturbance and distortion than those of 
later formation. Of the former class, numerous singular illus- 
trations may be seen in the transition slate rocks. The rock 
distinguished by the name of mountain limestone, is particu- 
larly remarkable for its contortions ; an example may be men- 
tioned, at the upper part of the Vale of Neath, in the Dynais 
rock, where its once flexible beds are twisted into the form of 
natural arches.

Buckland^s Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere, 259 

Enormous displacements and flexures of the chalk formation 
have given rise to geological speculation. In illustration we 
might refer to the beautiful drawings of Mr. Webster, in his 
letters to Sir Henry Englefield, on the geology of the Isle of 
Wight. Curvatures in the chalk of the Isle of Purbeck, of ex- 
traordinary figure, were first pointed out by the same gentleman. 
A remarkable mass of chalk appears in the cliff at Trimingham 
in Norfolk, and is represented in the accompanying sketch, {fig, 
122.) It would appear that this was a portion stripped and 
uplifted from the original horizontal mass ; and, if we can judge 
from the flexuous arrangement of its numerous bands of flints, 
has been folded by prodigious force into the form of a boulder, 
on a gigantic scale ; its length being seventy, and its height 
twenty, yards. The surf has considerably reduced its dimen- 
sions, but it is still a conspicuous object to the mariners, its 
white outline being relieved against the dark blue clay in 
which it is embedded ; and, as it is somewhat more indurated 
than the surrounding mass, it forms a small headland. 

122 




;gi- 



In all the cases of stratification we have endeavoured to illus- 
trate, their derangements must have taken place subsequently 
to their original formation. Some of these strata were appa- 
rently disturbed while the mass retained sufficient flexibility and 
adhesion of its parts, to assume those distorted forms without 
fracture ; others were not disturbed until after the entire 
consolidation of their materials, and present only angular 
fractures and disrupted planes. It cannot be doubted that 
the deposition of most of the ancient strata took place, while 
the waters from whence they subsided were in a comparative 
state of quiescence. Of this fact, the fine preservation of the 
most delicate shells, and other organic bodies affords unequi- 
vocal testimony. Gf a different character, however, is that 
accumulation of heterogeneous materials, which often forms a 
thick covering over the regular strata, and has obtained the 



260 



Martiii's Geological Memoir, and 



name of diluvium, as resulting from that catastrophe which so 
greatly modified the face of our earth. It is impossible to 
conceive any thing more strongly indicative of the tumultuous 
action of prodigious currents than those deposits display. — 
On the Norfolk coast, where they arrive at their greatest 
thickness, an abundance of characteristic sections are exposed. 
The following {fg, 123.) was sketched in 1824', and shows part 
of the cliff, about 100 ft. high, west of Cromer. 

123 




We might multiply illustrations of diluvial contortions^ to 
any extent, were it essential. They consist of concentric 
layers of sand, gravel, clay, and chalk, or of irregular beds of 
each, and occasionally exhibit enormous boulders of chalk, and 
fragments of rocks. At Beeston, on the same coast, may be 
observed another singular section, whence the following sketch 
{Jig, 124.) is taken. In both cases, the whole reposes upon crag.

Our geologists have scarcely decided whether the ferruginous 
sands of the eastern counties, containing the marine shells, 
locally termed crag^ should be arranged as appertaining to this 
great diluvial deposit; some considering it as proper dilu- 
vium, while others are inclined to view it as a distinct marine 
formation, covered by diluvium, and reposing its southern por- 
tion upon the London clay, and its northern immediately upon 
the chalk. Without adverting further to that point, we sub- 



BucJcland^s Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere. 261 

join two sections of its beds, for the purpose of augmenting 
our illustrations of stratification. 

125 




The above {Jig, 125.) represents a common form in the dis- 
position of the layers. In these cases, the horizontal divisions 
appear to indicate a succession of eras, or periods of deposit ; 
the intermediate beds are frequently arranged in oblique planes. 
The site is near Orford, Suffolk, where the crag forms a coarse 
sandstone, containing several fossil sponges, and is used as a 
soft building material. The following sketch (126.) is from the 
ferruginous shelly crag of the caverns near Languard Cottage.

Having, by the foregoing series of illustrations, prepared 
the way for a better consideration of the Weald, we shall in- 
troduce the reader to this district, in the words of Mr. Martin. 
{GeoL Mem.y p. 9.) These will be rendered more intelligible 
by the annexed plan (fg, 127.) which has been reduced from 
the Geological Society's map, in preference to the less accu- 
rate one which accompanies the Memoir. 

" It must be well known to every traveller who has crossed 
this valley, that, upon descending from the chalk hills in any 
part of its western extremity, he enters upon a tract of sandy 
country, occasionally rising into considerable eminences, and 
of very varied agricultural aspect. From thence he descends 
still farther into extensive, woody, and cultivated districts of 
clay soil, and of exceedingly undulating surface. Traversing 
this clay country, locally called, and by notoriety, the proper 
* Weald,' he emerges again across the same sand to reach a 
range of chalk hills, similar to those he left behind him. In 
the eastern part of the valley, the same series is observed, with 



262 



Martm^s Geological Memoir, and 



the difference, that the sands immediately below the chalk are 
not so prominent, and the middle of the clay country has a 
greater intermixture of sandy lands, not destitute of pictu- 
resque beauty, but of inferior agricultural character.

" The space thus comprised has otherwise, in geological 
language, got the name of the ' Weald Denudation ; ' because 
there is every reason to believe, from the uniformity of the 
structure of the valley, and the regularity and peculiar dispo- 
sition of its chalk boundaries, that the chalk itself, in all its 
subordinate strata, with perhaps some others often found in- 
cumbent upon the chalk, have been once continued over it 
from side to side (all uniting to form a high table-land, but a 
small part of a greater expansion of the same materials), and 
of which it has since been stripped or denuded.

" To explain better what is understood by this denud- 
ation, or stripping oflP of the chalk strata, let the reader ima- 
gine a plain of chalk, covered or not with other lands of a 
kindred nature, extended over a part of France, and continued 
without interruption to the north of England. Let him then 
suppose, that, looking from above the Alton Hills, he sees the 
chalk, with its accompanying strata, rent asunder ; part sink- 
ing southward, to give a bed to the English Channel, from the 
race of Portland to Beachy-Head (leaving some fractured por- 
tions standing, to tell the story of convulsions), part northward,

to form the south side of what is called the London basin, from 
Marlborough Downs to the Straits of Dover. 

" Let him also suppose, that, whilst this is in progress, and all 
the immense intervening masses are fissured and crumbled by 
convulsion, a flood of water, powerful beyond comprehension, 
at the same instant, or immediately after, rushing over, and 
entering the broken surface, sweeps the whole contents of what 
is now the weald excavation before it, into the North Sea — 
itself but a part of the abyss just then opened, perhaps by the 
same concussion, to receive them, 

« Or, let 

" ' A change come o*er the spirit of his dream. 
That is not all a dream.' 

Let him suppose this part of our island lifted up out of the 
ocean by an impelling power from below, some parts of it more 
steadily and evenly, others with such irregular and successive 
heavings, as to produce the effects above spoken of; disrup- 
tion of the central parts, and such Assuring and rending of the 
circumference, as an irregular action is calculated to produce 
upon a ponderous^ and frangible material. 

" Such a dream, splendid as it may be, will fall far short of 
the reality of those changes that can be demonstrated to have 
taken place in parts of the world, well understood to be more 
ancient than these under consideration. 

" If the mind is staggered at the immensity of such an 
operation, let it be answered, that the Weald Valley is but a 
small furrow on the earth's surface. And let our thoughts 
revert for comparison to many greater natural phenomena; 
to the height of the Himalaya, which may be well supposed 
to have felt the power of the same ocean stream, perhaps to 
have been lifted out of it, or to the five miles of depth, which 
may be given to that ocean ; and then consider how small a 
proportion the aggregate ten miles holds to the diameter of 
the globe itself. 

" Noihing is great, nor nothing little, in the operations of 
nature ; and such disclosures as these sink into insignificance 
before the wonders of astronomy ! The mind is lost in the 
contemplation of the immeasurable power to which it is indif- 
ferent, that 

" * Now a bubble bursts, and'now a world.' " 

Without entering into the detail of the strata beneath the 
chalk, which are exposed by the Weald denudation, it will be 
sufficient here to state that they are recognised by the names of 
malm-rock, or green sand, the gault or blue marl, and the upper 
ferruginous sand, all of which are now classed by the author 
under the comprehensive term glauconite. Beneath this occurs 



264 Martinis Geological Memoir, mid 

another group, on which he has conferred the name o^isoealdeji *, 
consisting of the Weald clay, with alternating beds of sand and 
and of Sussex or Petworth marble; and the deposit called 
the Hastings, or iron, sands, with its accompanying beds of 
clay, sandstone, and calcareous grit. Descriptions of the cha- 
racters, areas, and peculiar fossils of all these formations may 
be consulted in the memoirs of Mantell, Martin, Webster, 
Murchison, Dr. Fitton, and some other writers. The struc- 
ture of the Weald is well represented in the sections of Kent 
and Sussex, by Mr. William Smith, and explained in the 
article on Valleys of Elevation, by Dr. Buckland, with whom 
that term originated. 

It has been observed, by Messrs. Conybeare and Phillips, 
that the course of the rivers watering this district, and the 
configuration of the valleys which convey them, present a very 
interesting geological phenomena. The great valleys of the 
Weald were remarked to be parallel to the direction of the 
strata ; but these do not form the channels through which any 
of the more important streams seek the sea. These rivers 
flow from the centre towards the north and south, at right 
angles both to the Weald and to the strata by which it is 
encircled, through gorges opened across the strata, instead of 
being turned by their escarpments into the great Weald val- 
leys, as they would be if the fractures in these escarpments 
were filled up. There is here displayed one of the many in- 
stances of a double system of valleys, crossing each other 
transversely, which the authors, from whom the preceding de- 
scription has been abridged, were amongst the earliest to point 
out. 

The following diagram (/^. 129.) exhibits the geological po- 
sition of the Weald denudation, bounded by the chalk basins 
of London and Hampshire, " between which it lies like a 
trough or gulley ; or like a third basin elevated between tlie 
other two, and draining its waters into them through cracks 
or channels in its sides.'' {Martin, p. 55,) By the strong 
lines drawn from the centre of the Weald, it is intended to 
mark the mode in which the drainage is effected.

particularly in the escarpments of the chalk, " and in several 
instances are directly opposed to each other ; which could not 
have happened without a simultaneous action and common 
consent and continuity of parts. The coincidence is therefore 
the more remarkable, and proves not only the continuity of 
the chalk strata at the moment of convulsion, but also their 
uniform density and strength." {Martin, p. 61.)

to exhibit the entire characters of a particular case, either of 
denudation or of valleys by elevation, will, it is hoped, assist

courses of the rivers which discharge through the transverse 
ravines are denoted by arrows. 




Valfetf of Elevation 

From the two preceding sections it will be perceived that 
the outcrops of nearly the whole series of strata in the Weald 
are cut through, both to the north and south. These fissures, 
in some cases, have resulted from subsidence ; in others from 
a compound displacement of the mass. In no instance are 
these varied disturbances more strikingly exemplified than in 
the passage of the river Arun through this district. It is im- 
portant to mention that the strata intersected by these open- 
ings have, in several instances, been observed to be lower on 
the eastern than on the western sides, and that there exists a 
general longitudinal depression of the whole, from the west 
towards the east, independently of the dip to the north and 
south, which our sections show. Hence it is suggested that 
the force which elevated the Weald strata operated in an oblique 
direction to their planes. 

From all we can collect, the author conceives that the denu- 
dation of the Weald was simultaneous with the depression of 
the London and Isle of Wight basins. " The acts of basining 
and of denudation w^ere contemporaneous, and stand in the 
relation of cause and consequences." 

" That the Weald vacuity would have been a lake, but for 
these gullies, is sufficiently evident ; but that it has ever been 
so is by no means probable, from any thing that can be ob- 
served at present. The hypothesis which supposes it to have 
been a lake subsequently to the great catastrophe which hol- 
lowed it out, also supposes these outlets to have been the oper- 

VoL. I. — No. 3. T

ation of watery erosion, the friction of their own streams, or the 
debacle of the lake itself. That this could not have been the 
case, is proved by the existence of more than one of them. 
The first that gave way would render all the rest unnecessary 
and impossible; and if every drain had had its separate pool, 
the water would never have risen high enough in either of 
them, separately, to force a passage through so many obstacles. 

" If, on the other hand, it be proved that these masses are 
deeply fissured, it is also proved that they have been in motion. 
And the formation of such a channel as here described, in a 
direct line through such heterogeneous materials, must have 
been the result of a simultaneous movement of the whole, let 
the moving power be what it might. That this operation was 
coeval with the catastrophe which left the material features of 
this part of the world such as we see them, is apparent from 
a collective view of the concomitant phenomena. And whe- 
ther the Sussex and Surrey hills, with their accompanying 
strata, were severed by the disruption and dispersion of the 
intervening parts, or simply by the sliding down of the whole 
mass, which is much less probable, or the joint effect of these 
causes, the slightest inclination or obliquity of the basis, upon 
which it must be supposed to rest, would be sufficient to open 
the fissures in the direction in which we see them.'* {Marfin, 
p. 74.) 

" To the eye of the practised observer, the Weald valley 
presents the appearance of a great water channel after a flood ; 
some parts of it clean and clear from all incumbrance, others 
loaded with drift; the banks in some parts torn clean away, 
in others heaped up with rubbish." {Martin, p. 84.) 

But, with regard to the notion that the exposure of the strata 
beneath the chalk, in the Weald valley, is solely the effect of 
denudation, Mr. Martin is inclined to support Dr. Buckland's 
views, in withholding his assent to that hypothesis. " I am 
disposed fully to allow," observes Dr. Buckland, " that the 
force of water has been sufficient to sweep away the greatest 
portion of the loose and shattered fragments, -which, after the 
elevation I am assuming, nmst have covered the axis of this 
valley, and which must still have remained there, in the form 
of rubbish, had there been no subsequent diluvial action to 
drift them away. But I think the slightest inspection of the 
sections of the Weald will at once convince us, that no power 
of denudation by water could have produced the doubly in- 
clined position of the entire body of the strata within this dis- 
trict, as well as of the chalk by which it is surrounded ; and 
that we must here again have recourse to a force producing 
elevation from beneath, along the axis of the valley, if we 



Buckland's Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere, 267 

could find an adequate cause for the effects that have been 
produced in it, along an extent of sixty miles in length and 
twenty miles in breadth." {Geol. Trans.^ vol. ii. p. 124.) 

Dr. Buckland's paper on the formation of valleys by the 
elevation of the strata that enclose them, is so closely con- 
nected with the subject of Mr. Martin's memoir, that we shall 
not find a more appropriate opportunity of adverting to it than

here. The first object of this eminent geologist is, to show the 
arrangement of the strata immediately to the south of New- 
bury, and, in particular, to describe that remarkable denu- 
dation within the chalk, which contributed to form the Valley 
of Kingsclere. {fg, 131.)

On inspection of the section which accompanies the paper, 
a striking similarity to that of the Weald valley, in con- 
nection with the London basin, will be at once recognised, 
and it will further elucidate the relation between the formation 
of basins and valleys of elevation. They are both here intro- 
duced. (/^. 132, 133.)

The southern edge of this denudation forms the highest 
crest of the chalk, Inkpen Hill being 1011 feet above the sea. 
Its northern edge is less elevated, and the strata of the two 
escarpments dip, in opposite directions, on each side of the 
anticlinal line which passes along the centre of the valley. 

The interior consists of the green sand formation (glauconite 
of Martin). The valley comprehended within the escarpment 
is from four to five miles long, and from one to two miles 
broad. Another, extremely similar, called the Valley of Ham, 
occurs five miles to the westward, immediately under Inkpen 
Hill, and is about half the area of that of Kingsclere. 

Many other valleys of this class, in the chalk and older 
formations, are mentioned by Dr. Buckland, and our^. 113. 
represents one of them in the Vale of Westbury, near Bristol. 
Their drainage is generally effected " by an aperture in one 
of their lateral escarpments, and not at either extremity of 
their longer axis, as would have happened had they been 
simply excavated by the sweeping force of rapid water ; and, 
as it is utterly impossible to explain the origin of any valleys 
of this description by denudation alone, or, indeed, without 
referring the present position of their component strata to a. 
force acting from below, and elevating the strata along their 
central line of fracture, I shall venture so far to involve this 
theory of their origin with the facts which they display, as to 
designate them by the appellation of Valleys of Elevation : of 
course, due allowance must be made for their subsequent' 
modification by diluvial denudation." {Geol. Trafis., vol.ii. 1 23.) 

After reciting these examples, the author concludes : *' The 
facts, then, which we have examined, conspire to lead us to 
the conclusion, that not only many enclosed valleys similar to 
that of Kingsclere, but also, in a less degree, many open val- 
leys similar to that of Pewsey and the great central valley of 
Kent and Sussex, though largely modified by denudation, owe 
their origin to an antecedent elevation and fracture of their 
component strata ; and these phenomena may be regarded as 
of frequent occurrence in the formations of all ages, and as 
indicating the multitude of disturbing causes by which the 
earth's surface has been affected." (Geol, 7ra?is., vol.ii. p. 125.) 

Dr. Buckland adduces evidence to show that the superior 
strata, which have been conceived peculiar to the basins of 
London and Hampshire, were once continuous. Traces of this 
union are observable in the detached portions which yet exist, 
even on the highest eminences of the chalk formation. On 
this hypothesis, which there seems little reason to dispute, the 
London and plastic clays stretched uninterruptedly from the 
coast of >forfolk to Dorsetshire, prior to tlie great era of the 



BucklanWs Formation of the Valley of Kifigsclere, 26$ 

deluge; and, in so doing, they would only conform to the 
course of all the other formations which crop out to the west- 
ward of them. 

The tender and destructible nature of the deposits above 
the chalk, would render them peculiarly liable to be swept 
away, in some parts, by diluvial currents. Their preservation 
at other points, and " their separation into the two distinct 
basins of London and Hampshire, have resulted partly from 
local elevations and depressions, by subterraneous violence, 
since the deposition of the plastic clay, and partly from the 
still more recent removal of much of their substance by diluvial 
denudation." (Geol. Trans., vol. ii. p. 127.) 

Before concluding this article we must return to Mr. Mar- 
tin, on the supposed depositions of strata in basins. " Although 
the contents of these chalk basins have been carefully ex- 
amined and described, no satisfactory explanation of the 
mechanism or mode of formation of the basins themselves has 
yet been given ; and, since the French naturalists first made 
use of the term, so much laxity has obtained in the application 
of the word basin, that it is made to comprehend almost every 
depression in the earth's surface." {Martin, p. 55.) 

" The obscurity in which this branch of the subject has 
been left, appears to have arisen from the difficulty of con- 
sidering it apart from a general theory of displacement, and 
from the conflicting opinions prevalent upon that subject ; and 
because geologists, not professed Vulcanists, have been in the 
habit of considering all displacement as the effect of one of 
two causes — of subsidence from simple gravity, or excavation 
by watery erosion." [Id., p. 56.) 

" But, in whatever mode these basins exist, they have been 
considered as the recipients and continent cavities of succes- 
sional deposits of different eras and different agencies ; and 
their preexistence is necessarily involved in that consideration. 
How far this theory agrees with appearances developed by 
later discoveries, remains to be proved. Some relaxation of 
the original idea of deposits in the Paris basin exclusively is 
said to have been made ; and the discovery of the same strata 
elsewhere in a horizontal, and what may be considered an 
original position, serves to strengthen the opinion, that the 
strata above the chalk are all of a date anterior to the con- 
vulsion which divested it of its flotz character." [Id., p. 57.) 

In another place he observes, " Of the English basins it 
may be safely asserted, that, being fissured in all their parts 
in the act of subsidence, and many parts of them of higher 
level than the intervening excavations, no deposit coidd have 
taken place "isoithin them wliich did not fill dennded cavitieL 

T 3 



270 Martin's GeologtcU Mevioir, and \ 

The contemporiety of these acts being established, it follows, 
of course, that the chalk, with all its superincumbent strata, 
existed previously in a horizontal position." [Id.^ p. 89.) 

The true disposition of a chalk basin, according to Mr. 
Martin's diagram [Jig. 134.), arises from the fracture and sub- 
sidence of its parts ; for, although large hollows have doubtless 
been formed upon its surface, its thickness is not adequate to 
admit of the construction of a basin in that way only. 



134 




From the foregoing extracts an accordance will be per- 
ceived, between these authorities, in the conviction that, an- 
terior to the great derangements of the Weald and the chalk 
basins, the strata had existed in a horizontal position, and that 
" what are called ter-tiary formations (those above the chalk) 
were deposited before the basins were in existence," and 
covered a far wider area than they have done subsequently to 
the deluge. " A wide field is thus opened, not for conjecture, 
but for research ; and, if the subject of derangement be culti- 
vated with the same fidelity of observation as has been of late 
that of structure, results cannot fail of being produced, de- 
structive of many errors, and corrective of many received 
opinions." {Martin, p. 90.) 



In a note, appended to Mr. Martin's memoir, some con- 
jectures are offered on the probability of lines of fracture ti'a- 
versing the London clay, over which the Tliames is conducted) 
and on the presumed risk to which the construction of a 
tunnel would hence be subjected. The direction of these fis- 
sures would resemble those in Mr. Martin's diagram. {Jig. 1 34.) 
*' A tunnel through the London clay, in those parts where the 
river has been directed over it, in an unsubsided or undisturbed 
state, is perfectly practicable ; but, where rent and subsidence, 
or what are commonly called faults, have taken place, there 
remains nothing but loose diluvial and alluvial soil, through 
which it must be at all times dangerous to venture. IF, there- 
fore, the expedients for repairing the mischief fail in this 
instance, a spot might still be chosen where the river takes its 
course over the clay, that has not been disturbed by the convid- 
sion which basined the chalk" {Martin, p. 89.) 



BucHafid^s Formation of the Valley of Kingsclere. 271 

We are a little at a loss to reconcile the latter paragraph 
with the conclusion to which the author elsewhere arrives, in 
conjunction with Dr. Buckland, that " the tertiary formations 
were deposited in a horizontal position before the basins were 
in existence." Admitting the justice of the conclusion, it is 
not unreasonable to infer that the incumbent strata would 
equally partake of the disturbances which so remarkably 
affected the chalk. 

That the accident which impeded the progress of the tunnel 
was occasioned by a fissure in the strata, of the description 
alhided to, is, however, by no means apparent from the cir- 
cumstances. The excavations were too near the surface to 
afford sufficient proof that it was other than the usual " broken 
ground" which forms the beds of most valleys. It is well 
known, and observed in practical operations, such as forming 
tunnels, driving levels, and sinking shafts, that all formations, 
whether composed of soft or of indurated materials, are, to a 
considerable depth below the surface, " shaken" and doubtful, 
consequently treacherous. No mineral or coal beds " prove," 
with any approach to certainty, until they have been pursued 
beyond the influence of the operations which have disturbed 
the exterior crust of the earth. We do not refer solely to the 
irregular accumulations of what is called diluvial matter, but 
to disturbances, diluvial or otherwise, which extend still deeper. 
It is obvious that the thickness of diluvium or of transported 
materials is, of all things, the most uncertain, particularly at 
the bottoms of valleys, and in the beds of rivers. Nothing can 
present a more i*agged outline than a section of the base of a 
diluvial district, or demonstrate more incontestibly that there 
is not the slightest agreement between the outline of the base 
on which the detritus is deposited, and the present contour of 
the earth's surface. 

With regard to the geological position of the Thames tun- 
nel, it has been customary to speak of its passing through the 
London clay. If the excavation be pursued, it will probably 
intersect that formation towards the northern portion of the 
line; but hitherto, from the materials which have been brought 
up, it is quite evident that the work has proceeded in some of 
the plastic clay beds, so denominated, agreeing with those 
exposed at Woolwich, and much less favourably adapted to 
subterraneous operations, than the tenacious mass of the Lon- 
don clay which reposes upon it. The formations lying im- 
mediately to the south-east of London, have by no means been 
accurately defined upon our geological maps.

The value of the original work of Cuvier is well established ; the duty of 
the reviewer, therefore, is to ascertain the fidelity of the translation, and 
the merits of the additional descriptions. It would have given us pleasure 
could we have bestowed on the correctness of the translation unqualified 
praise ; but justice requires us to say, that, though it generally conveys to 
the English reader a sufficiently clear view of the author's meaning, there 
are several parts in which the sense is imperfectly or very incorrectly given. 
For instance, p. 26 of the translation : — " Vegetables derive their nourish- 
vienh from the SUN, atid from the circtimfluent atmosphere in the form of 
water,^* &c. Cuvier says, " the soil and the atmosphere present to plants 
for their nourishment, water," &c. " Le sol" may, doubtless, be either the 
sun or the soil, but the obvious meaning of the author might have directed 
the translator which word to choose ; and, more particularly, as, in the 
preceding page, there occurs nearly the same passage : " Vatmosphhe et la 
terre apportent aux vegStaux des siicSy^ &c. In page 22. of the translation, 
we find the following remarkable error: "All organised beings produce 
their like, otherivise death would be a necessary consequence of life, and the 
species must become extinct." This passage is utterly unintelligible, or, to 
speak more plainly, the extreme of absurdity. The author has before stated 
that death is a necessary consequence of the continued action of life on the 
animal frame ; and the sentence so improperly translated, refers to this 
action on the vital organs. " Tous les etres organises produisent leur 
semblables, autrement/a mort itant tine suite necessaire de la vie, leurs especes 
ne pourraient subsister." Nothing can be more clearly expressed, or more 
easy to translate literally: — " All organised beings produce their like ; were 
it not so, death being a necessary consequence of vital action, the species 
must become extinct." We might quote other errors in the translation of 
the first sixty pages, for which it would be difficult to account, except by 
supposing that the translation has been made from an inaccurate copy of 
the original. 

The notes and the original matter of the translator and his colabo- 
rateurs, have greatly increased the bulk of the work ; and the number of 
the engravings have greatly enhanced its price ; the latter, at least, without 
any thing like proportionately adding to its value. The plan of getting up 
the book has not been properly digested before it was commenced. If 
engravings were to be given, either every species described ought to have 
been figured, or only one species of each order, tribe, or genus ; or only 
such figures as were necessary to illustrate technicalities. Instead of this. 



276 



GtHffith-s Ciwier. 




we have numerous genera, of which a single figure is not given of any 
oije of the species; while of other genera, copperplates are engraved of 
seyeral of the species. This indefinite, unsystematic mode of giving illus- 
trative engravings, publishers will, in time, learn to avoid, from the necessity 
which they will find of accommodating their productions to the present im- 
proved state of the public judgment in books, called forth, in a great measure, 
by an increased taste for reading, and the diminished means of procurinc this 
gratification. We can see no occasion for engravings on copper to illustrate a 
work like the present ; had the figures been on wood, they would have been 
nearly as expressive, or, at least,sufficiently so for every useful purpose, as that 
which we now give of the Geoffi"oy'« Shrike (^g. 143.) will show to those who 

can compare it with the ^^^^^^^--^~-__ ^_Z— :=^ s^ 14j 

copperplate from which 
it was copied inPartXV. 
They could have been 
printed along with the 
descriptions, and more 
readily compared with 
them; and, had they 
been limited to the type 
species of each genus, 
the work would have 
been much more com- 
plete, and, we should 

think, not near so high 

priced. There is also 

an omission which de- 
tracts from the value of the work. As the system of Cuvier is founded 

on the physiology of animals, there ought to have been plates given of those 

parts of the osteology of vertebrated animals which form the distinctive 

characters. They are not given in the original work of Cuvier, because it 

was intended to form a cheap text-book, and the reader is supposed to have 

access to the museums of Paris, and to extensive libraries of natural history; 

but in a work which will be ten times the price of the original, they ought 

to have been added. We regret to be obliged to make these objections, 

and should have • ^ ^ 

been much better 

pleased to have 

given the work 

entire instead of 

qualified appro- 
bation. 

As a principal 

object of the last

Hogg, the Rev. John., A.M. F.L.S. andCamb. Ph. Soc. : On the Natural His- 
tory of the Vicinity of Stockton on Tees. Stockton. 8vo, pp. 96, 1 map. 

This work is to form an appendix to the Parochial History of Stockton, 
by the Rev. John Brewster, now in the press. It is an excellent specimen 
of the local Flora, Fauna, and Geographica, and printed with very great 
accuracy in regard to names, synonyms, and references to established works 
containing descriptive and historical particulars. The use of such local 
catalogues is three-fold ; 1. as contributing towards a more complete and 
accurate natural history of Britain ; 2. as pointing out to the inhabitants, or 
to those intending to inhabit particular districts, the climate and the natural 
productions which they may expect to meet with, and consequently, to a cei*- 
tain extent, the eligibility of the situation for rural and domestic happiness ; 
and 3. as a record by which future naturalists may determine the local 
changes which have taken place in natural and physical history. 

The catalogue begins with the birds, of which there are no fewer than 
126 species, arranged according to 
the system of Cuvier. Of fishes 
there are 19 species ; of insects, 67 of 
the most remarkable are enumerated ; 
of fluviatile shells, 20 species ; of 
marine animals, the Sea Scorpion, or 
Father Lasher (Cottus *S'c6rpius L.) 
{Jig. 145), and Ray's Toothed Gilt- ' 
head (5parus Raii) {Jig. 146.), both rare species, but the last extremely 

so. The first speci- 
men of iSparus Raii 
found in England was 
sent to Mr. Ray by 
his friend, Mr. John- 
son, a gentleman of 
Yorkshire, who in- 
formed him it was 
found on the sands 
near the Tees* mouth, 
Sept. 18. 1681. Mr. 
Hogg informs us that 
in August 1821 he 
saw the only one 
known to have been

8een near the Tees since that sent to 

Ray. Of MoUusca nuda,or shell-less 

moUusca, 7 species are enumerated, 

including the officinal Cuttle Fish 

(iSepia officinalis Lin.) {Jig. 147.)> 

often cast up on the shore at Seaton, 

and from which is taken the cuttle 

bone, formerly used in medicine. Of 

MoUusca testacea 34 species are enu- 
merated, chiefly bivalve shells; of 

M. cirripedes, z species ; of M. anne- 

lidae, 4 species; of M. radiaria, 16 

species; and of M. polyperia no 

fewer than 54 species, including the 

Sea Fir (Sertularia abietina) {fig. 148. a), a coralline very common on 
f) ^ ^afl shells and other substances; 

Tubulkria ramosa {b), a 
branched tubular coralline, 
also very common ; Cellu- 
laria cornuta, a horned cel- 
lular coralline, also com- 
mon ; iMillepora foliacea 
(c); Corallina officinalis (rf), 
very common; and ^pongia 
urens, occulata {fig. 149. 
a), and fluviatilis (6), three 
British sponges by no means 
uncommon. 

The plants are arranged 
according to the natural 
system, and enter into 50 

orders of DicotyMdones, 13 orders of Monocotyl^dones, and 8 orders of 

AcotyMdones. 

The geology of the vicinity of Stockton is comprised under, l.lias; 2. 

red marl, or new red sand- ^ 

stone ; 3. magnesian lime- % 

stone ; 4. coal measures ; 

5. diluvium ; 6. all' uium ; 

and 7. basaltic dj^kes. 
We should like to see 

gardeners set about form- 
ing such catalogues of the 

natural history of their 

masters' estates, or of the 

parish in which they live. 

Mr. Wood, of Deepdene, 

is well qualified for form- 
ing such a catalogue, and we 
hope he will set the example.

Quinary Arrangements in Natural History, which is at once philosophical 
and highly interesting. Natural orders are related to each other by so 
many points, that Linnaeus compared them to countries in a map ; but the 
affinities of an object, Mr. Colebrooke observes, ramify in every direction, 
and cannot be well represented on a plain surface. The Dichotomous mode 
of classification has been so represented. " It proceeds upon a selection 
of single characters in succession, which, taken affirmatively and negatively, 
furnish at each step two distinctions ; one for objects possessing the cha- 
racter in question, the other for such as want it. For example, at the 
very first step, organic and inorganic substances ; and, thereafter, verte- 
brate and non- vertebrate animals. So, Cotyledonous and Acotyledonous 
vegetables ; and, again, Monocotyledonous and Dicotyledonous plants. If 
the series in which the characters are severally noticed be judiciously 
chosen, the Dichotomous arrangement, well pursued, supplies a very in- 
structive key to natural knowledge. Many professedly natural distributions 
have been so ordered. But a more instructive arrangement is that which 
exhibits an object in all its bearings; which places it amidst its cognates; 
and contiguous to them, again, those which approach next in degree of 
affinity, and thence branching every way to remoter relations." Objects 
or groups to be so arranged must occupy a space of three dimensions. 
Were the space so occupied indefinite, and round any given or imaginary 
point, the form of the group would be considered globular, from the same 
law of imagination by which the sky seems vaulted, and the universe neither 
square, nor long, nor angular. Hence, as five points form one of the simplest 
modes of expressing the centre and superficies (the two poles and the 
zenith and nadir of a globe), the Quinary arrangement is the simplest distri- 
bution of a large assemblage of objects. The centre group may be supposed 
to be the type, and the four circumferential ones so many clusters of related 
objects. If we imagine no perfect type, and, in consequence, the central 
group omitted, we shall then have the Quaternary arrangement, which, 
according to Ocken, a Swedish botanist, is the true natural distribution. 
Without entering farther into the subject, our readers will, we hope, have 
distinct ideas of the Dichotomous, Quinary, and Quaternary systems ; and 
they will see that the Quinary and Quaternary are but different modes of 
expression for what is essentially a circular, or, more correctly, a spherical 
system. These and other systems we shall enter into at greater length, 
when we conceive our young readers to be sufficiently advanced. In the 
mean time, it is easy to conceive that the surface of a globe will be repre- 
sented by three points more easily than by five, and by five less perfectly 
than by seven or twelve. So that all that seems beyond dispute in the 
matter is, that the most perfect abstract idea of an arrangement is that in 
which all the objects composing a group shall be clustered together like a 
sphere. It should never be forgotten that nature knows only species, and 
that all systems of arrangement or classification are merely attempts at 
generalising, for the sake of lessening the trouble of knowing the individuals.

Electro-Attraction of Leaves.— The influence of electricity on organ- 
ised nature, both animal and vegetable, appears to be progressively better 
understood. The state of the atmospheric electricity is well known to exert a 
very marked influence on man, in respect of health and disease ; and it is a 
considerable step in the explanation of the sources of this, which has been 
ascertained, if not discovered, by M. Astier. His experiments have led him to 
conclude that the leaves, the iiairs, the thorns, &c., of plants, tend to main- 
tain in them the requisite proportion of electricity ; and, by drawing off 
from the atmosphere what is superabundant, that they also act in some mea- 
sure as thunder-rods and paragreles. In one of his experiments, M. Astier 
insulated the thorns of growing plants ; and, upon being exposed to the 
atmosphere when the electrical equilibrium was disturbed, they distinctly 
affected the electrometer. {Bulletin des Sciences Naturelles.) 

Evaporation on Mountains. — It has been ascertained by the experiments 
of M. van Marum, that vapours are more largely exhaled from the summits 
of lofty mountains than from the plains below, in consequence, it is sup- 
posed, of the diminution of atmospheric pressure. {Descript. des Appareils 
in Bui. IJn.) 

Propagation of Oysters^ ^c. — M. S. G. Luroth has made some severe 
remarks on the paper on this subject, in a recent volume of the Philosophical 
Transactions, by Sir Everard Home, whom he accuses of superficiality, 
want of novelty, and, worst of all, gross inaccuracy and credulity. In the 
points upon which he differs from other naturalists. Sir Everard is farther 
accused by M. Luroth of not having examined the descriptions previously 
published, contenting himself with his own very incomplete explanation of 
the excellent figures of Bauer. MM. Bojanus and Blainville would have 
set him right as to what he erroneously terms the oviduct in the Anodon- 
ton, had he taken the trouble to consult their writings. {Bulletin des 
Sciences Nat.) 

Australasian Botany. — M. J. B. A. Guillemin is publishing lithographical 
figures of the rarer plants of Australasia, under the auspices of M. Benj. 
Delessert. The first two decades contain figures of 20 plants, described, 
but not figured, by Brown, in his Prodromus Florce Novce Holldndice. The 
plates are accompanied by Brown's generic and specific characters, and 
other explanatory letter-press. {Bid. Un.) 

GERMANY. 

Systematic Arrangement of Acarides. — M. Hey den has undertaken the 
very difficult task of arranging the family of acarides, or mites, a group of 
animals which are frequently most important to be understood by the rural 
cultivator as well as by the naturalist. M, Heyden divides them into 69

genera, the greater part of them new. It would be well if the author would 
give specific descriptions, accompanied by good figures, of each of these 
genera. {Oken^s his.) 

Posthumous Works of Lyonnet. — The anatomical treatise of M. Lyonnet, 
on the caterpillar of the Cossus lignip^rda, has, from the period of its pub- 
lication, 70 years ago, been considered as a production quite unrivalled for 
minute and accurate research. The second part of this work was announced 
during the life of the author ; but, at his death, the publication of it was 
stopped. Our scientific friends will, therefore, rejoice to learn, that not 
only this second part, corrected by Lyonnet himself, but also his researches 
on the anatomy and metamorphosis of different species of insects, is about 
to appear at Leyden, under the aus|)ices of Dr. de Hann, the Conservateur 
of the Royal Museum of Natural History. {Revue Bibliograph. des Pays-

Prize in Natural History. — The Academy of Sciences of Turin pro- 
pose to give a prize, consisting of a gold medal, worth GOO livres, for the best 
work, general or particular, upon the natural history of the states of the 
king of Sardinia. The works may be either in Italian, Latin, or French, in 
MS. or printed and published at Turin before the 28th February, 1829.

Ornithology of Tuscany. — Dr. Savi, Professor of Natural History at Pisa, 
is publishing an important work on the birds of Tuscany, entitled Ornitolo- 
gia Toscana. The work is ably com|)osed, and contains many original 
observations. The author, however, has fallen into the mistake of being 
too prone to interfere with established arrangements. He has, in this way, 
extended the genus Sylvia, already too numerous, and divided it into nine 
families, among which we find ilferula and T'urdus ! ( Bid. Un.) 

SWITZERLAND. 

Fishes. — The late celebrated Prof. Jurine was for many years employed 
upon a natural history of the fishes of the lake of Geneva, which has just 
been published from his MSS., with figures engraved under his direction ; 
not as a separate work, however, but in the third volume of the Memoirs of 
the Society of Physics and Natural History of Geneva. It is, like all the 
author's productions, distinguished for originality and accurate science ; and, 
from the similarity between the Swiss fishes and our own, it well merits the 
attention of our British ichthyologists. 

Another work on the same subject, but comprehending all the fishes of 
Switzerland, has just been published at Zurich, by M. G. L. Hartman, and 
is entitled Helvetische Ichthyologie. {Bui. Un.) 

SWEDEN. 

Notice of certain rare Plants in the North <f Sweden. — M. Lcstudius has 
described, in continuation of a former memoir, a number of rare plants 
found by him in Lappmark, the mountains of Pitea, &c. Among these we 
find ifanunculus alpdstris, i/ieracium fuliginosum, 5'axifraga maculata, S. 
glabrata, &c. {Kongl, Vetens Kaps-Acad. Handlingar in Annales des Sciences 
NaturcUes.) 

Birds of Passage. — M. Eckstrocm has published an interesting paper on 
Swedish birds of passage, with tables of their arrival and departure from 
Scedermonland, kept from 1811 to 1825. The birds which arrive in autumn, 
and depart in spring, are, -FringHIa linaria, Panis caudatus, /'yrrhula vulgaris, 
^rmpelis garrula, Lanius excubitor, and Embcriza nivalis. He mentions the 



Natural History in Foreign Countries, 283 

curious fact of some migratory birds, at one time common, becoming rare, 
or entirely disappearing ; and others, which had previously been scarce, 
arriving in great numbers. (Ibid.) 

M. Magnus von Wright has given very interesting tables of the arrival 
of migratory birds in Finland, distingiiishing between Abo and Haminaulax, 
50 miles farther north. It would be interesting to compare these tables with 
those which have been made out of British migratory birds. {Ibid.) 

RUSSIA. 

Formation of the Embryo in the Grasses. — M. Trinius of St. Petersburg, is 
engaged in a keen controversy with M. Raspail of Paris, on the embryo of 
the grasses ; in consequence, it would appear, of some remarks made by the 
latter m the Bulletin des ScienceSy on the dissertation of M. Trinius, Z)e 
Graminibus uni et sesquifloris. The disputants have shown much botanical 
erudition, but the subject does not admit of abridgment in a notice. Those 
who are interested in it, will find the chief contested points detailed in the 
Bulletin des Sciences Naturelles pour Fevrier. 

Scientific Journey. — Professor Hanstein has set out on a journey to 
Siberia, accompanied by Lieutenant Due of the navy, and at St. Peters- 
burgh they met Dr. Erman, from Berlin, who will go with them as naturalist 
and astronomer. They will proceed from St. Petersburgh to Moscow, 
Kasan, and Tobolsk, and northwards along the Obi to Boresow, in order to 
examine the hitherto imperfectly known northernmost branch of the Ural 
chain, and to observe the temperature of that tract. They will afterwards 
go from Tobolsk by way of Tara, Tomsk, Krasnoiarsk, and Nischnei- 
Udinsk, to Irkoutsk, where they hope to arrive in time to pass the winter. 
Hence they mean to travel north-east to Jakoutsk, from which the most 
fatiguing part of the journey will be to Schotsk, as there are 1014 wersts 
(676 miles) to go over, in a country entirely uninhabited, in which they 
must pass a thousand streams, bivouac in the night, and take provisions for 
the whole journey. It is calculated that the tour may occupy two years. 
The grand object of this important expedition is to observe the phenomena 
of magnetism, and to ascertain, if possible, the situation of the magnetic 
poles, &c. {^New Monthly Magazine, August, 1828.)

An enormom Whale. — M. Kessels, naturalist at Ghent, has just enriched 
the cabinet of natural history there with the skeleton of an enormous 
whale. This specimen is 95 ft. long by 18 ft. high. When dissected, 
20,000 kilogrammes of blubber and 65,000 kilogrammes of flesh were cut 
away. M. Kessels has succeeded in preserving the tail, with the skin, 
blubber, and flesh undisturbed ; it is 22 ft. round the edge. In the opinion 
of many naturalists, amongst whom is M. Cuvier, this fish could not have 
been less than 900 or 1000 years old. {Neiv Montldy Magazine^ No. xcii.

Floating Island. — From the earliest times, there are to be found in 
authors, notices of the singular geological phenomena of floating islands. 
Pliny tell us of the floating islands of the Lago de Bassanello, near Rome ; 
in Loch Lomond, in Scotland, there is or was a floating island ; and in the 
lake of Derwent Water, in Cumberland, such islands appeal* and disappear 
at indefinite periods. Mr. A. Pettingal, jun., has recently described a floating 
island, about a mile southwards of Newbury port, 140 poles in length, and 
120 in breadth. It is covered with trees j and in summer, when dry wea-

Port Royal Cassia. — At a meeting of the Jamaica Society for the En- 
couragement of Agriculture and other Arts, held in the early part of the 
present year, a paper by Dr. Bancroft was read, concerning a species of 
Classia growing wild on the sands near Port Royal, which has long been 
used by the inhabitants of that town instead of S^nna^ and which Professor 
Swartz had described, in 1 791, under the name of Cassia Sinna, but express- 
ing a doubt of its being the same with the Cassia Senna of botanists. The 
uncertainty, however, that has existed until lately, concerning the plants 
that yield the senna of commerce, had prevented the doubt of Swartz 
from being cleared up. Fresh and dried specimens of the plant were pro- 
duced, and various omissions and differences were pointed out between 
these and the description of Swartz ; and proofs adduced to show that the 
Port Royal Cassia is a very distinct species from Cassia obovata, commonly 
called Senna italica, to which it had been referred by some botanists. It 
was also stated to be essentially different from any of the species of Cassia 
described by systematic authors, particularly by Decandolle, in the second 
volume of his Prodromus, whose enumeration, comprehending 211 species, 
is the most recent, complete, and scientific ; whence it seemed probable 
that it was to be considered as a nondescript. A full description of its 
botanical characters was accordingly given, and it was proposed to designate 
it by the name of Cassia porturegalis (intimating its native place), and its 
specific characters were recorded. Proofs were given of its being equally 
active with common Senna ; its taste is, besides, less disagreeable, and it 
seems, moreover, to possess the advantage of causing much less griping ; as a 
proof of which, it was mentioned that mothers of families were in the habit 
of giving it to their children, even to infants, in the form of tea, with milk 
and sugar, and without any ginger or spice as a corrective. It had been sup- 
posed that it would not grow in any place but the sands near Port Royal ; a 
fine specimen, however, was produced, that had grown in Kingston, which 
rendered it probable that it might be cultivated in the low lands, at least, 
of this island; and the ready sale which a mild yet active Senna, such as 
this, was likely to meet with in the markets of Europe, afforded encourage- 
ment towards attempting to raise it by cultivation here. — Y.B, AprU,

Botanic Garden at the Havannah. — This is a new establishment, said to 
be finely laid out, and though not yet finished, to contain many curious 
plants and trees. On passing some low bushes in a wet situation, the 
attention of Mr. Bullock was attracted by the singular carved or embossed 
appearance of the leaves ; but on endeavouring to reach one, to examme 
it, he was greatly surprised at the ornaments disappearing in an instant, 
and discovering that the appearance was occasioned by a numerous family 
of beautiful little frogs, which had attached themselves to the foliage, and 
on his approach had leaped into the water. {Bui. Mex\, vol. i. p. 253.) 

TTie Ascent of Popocatapetl, hy Lieutenant William Gle7iniey R. ^. — 
The ascent commenced during the month of April 1827, from the village of 
Ameca, situated in the province of Puebla, ana near the N.W. foot of the 
volcano, at an elevation of 8216 ft. above ihe level of the sea, and distant 
14 leagues from Mexico. 

The author describes the sides of 'the mountain as thickly wooded with 
forests of pines, extending to the height of near 12,693 ft., beyond which 
altitude vegetation ceased entirely. The ground consisted of loose black 
sand of considerable depth, on which numerous fragments of basalt and 
pumice-stone were dispersed. At a greater elevation, several project- 
ing ridges, composed of loose fragments of basalt, arranged one above an- 
other, and overhanging precipices 600 or 700 ft. deep, presented formidable 
impediments to the author's progress ; and, in one direction only, a ravine

was observed to pass through these ridges, having its surface covered with 
loose black sand, down which fragments of rocks ejected from the crater 
continually descended. 

After twelve hours of incessant fatigue the author gained the highest 
point of the mountain on the western side of the crater, 17,884 ft. above 
the sea ; at which station the mercury in the barometer subsided to 15'63 
in., and the temperature indicated by the attached and detached thermome- 
ters,'was, respectively, 39° and 55° Fahr. at 5 o'clock P.M., when exposed to 
the direct rays of the sun. The plain of Mexico was enveloped in a thick 
haze, and the only distant objects visible at that time, were the volcanoes 
of Orizaba and Iztaccihuatl. The crater of Popocatapetl appeared to ex- 
tend one mile in diameter, and its edges, of unequal thickness, descended 
towards the east. The interior walls consisted of masses of rock arranged 
perpendicularly, and marked by numerous vertical channels, in many places 
filled with black sand. Four horizontal circles of rock, differently coloured, 
were also noticed within the crater; and from the edges of the latter, as 
well as from its perpendicular walls, several small columns of vapour arose 
smelling strongly of sulphur. The noise was incessant, resembling that 
heard at a short distance from the sea shore during a storm ; and at inter- 
vals of two or three minutes the sound increased, followed by an eruption 
of stones of various dimensions j the smaller were projected into the ravine 
before mentioned, the larger fell again within the crater. 

The sensations experienced by the author were analogous to those usu- 
ally felt by travellers at considerable elevations ; viz. weariness, difficult 
respiration, and headache, the latter inconvenience having been first per- 
ceived at a height of 16,895 ft. Tobacco smoke and spirituous liquors were 
also found to produce an unusually rapid effect upon the sensorium. {PrO'

These animals are never seen in the ^ B ^^^^^^^ ^ ^^^^^^^ ^ ^g 

groups like little villages all over the ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^5 
Pampas. The biscachos, when full-grown, are nearly as large as badgers, 
but their head resembles a rabbit's, except that they have large bushv 
whiskers. In the evening they sit outside their holes, and they all appear 
to be moralising. They are the most serious-looking animals I ever saw ; 
and even the young ones are grey-headed, have mustachios, and look 
thoughtful and grave. In the daytime, their holes are always guarded by 
two little owls, who are never an instant away from their posts. As one 
gallops by these owls they always stand looking at the stranger, and then 
at each other, moving their old-fashioned heads in a manner which is quite 
ridiculous, until one rushes bv them, when fear gets the better of their 
dignified looks, and they both run into the biscacho's hole. (Head's

An immense Medusa, a species of sea serpent, was thrown on shore near 
Bombay in 1819. It was about 40 ft. long, and must have weighed many 
tons. A violent gale of wind threw it high above the reach of ordinary 
tides ; in which situation it took nine months to rot ; during which process 
travellers were obliged to change the direction of the road for nearly a 
quarter of a mile, to avoid the offensive effluvia. It rotted so completely, 
that not a vestige of bone remained. (C. Telfair^ Esq. to R. Barclay ^ Esq., 
of Bury Hilly in Jam. Joum.y April, p. 406.) 

Hairy Man of Ava. — There is here a man covered from head to foot 
with hair, whose history is not less remarkable than that of the celebrated 
porcupine man, who excited so much curiosity in England and other parts 
of Europe nearly a century ago. The hair on the face of this singular being, 
the ears included, is shaggy, and about eight inches long : on the breast 
and shoulders it is from four to five. It is singular that'the teeth of this 
individual are defective in number, the molares, or grinders, being entirely 
wanting. This person is a native of the Shan country, or Lao, and from 
the banks of the upper portion of the Saluen, or Martaban River; he was 
presented to the king of Ava as a curiosity, by the prince of that country. 
At Ava he married a Burmese woman, by whom he has two daughters ; the 
eldest resembles her mother, the youngest is covered with hair, like her 
father, only that it is white, or fair, whereas his is now brown or black, hav- 
ing, however, been fair when a child, like that of the infant. With the 
exceptions mentioned, both the father and his child are perfectly well 
formed, and, indeed, for the Burman race, rather handsome. The whole 
family were sent by the king to the residence of the mission, where draw- 
ings and descriptions of them were taken. {Crawford's Mission to Ava.) 

Himalaya Mountains. — Captain Gerard, in exploring these mountains, 
with a view to measurement, had ascended to the height of 1 9,600 ft., 
being 400 ft. higher than Humboldt had ascended on the Andes. The latter 
part of Captain Gerard's ascent, for about two miles, was on an inclined 
plane of 42°, a nearer approach to the perpendicular than Humboldt con- 
ceived it possible to climb for any distance together. (Heber^s India.) 

A Volcano has burst forth at Bakon in Persia, producing a column of red 
fire, without smell, of extraordinary height, which burned for three hours, 
and then sunk to about 2 ft., covering a surface about 600 ft. by 400 ft. At 
the end of twenty-four hours it had nearly ceased to burn, and will proba- 
bly become extinguished without leaving any crater. {Athen<sum.)

Abyssinia. — The celebrated traveller, Edward Ruppel, is on the point 
of setting out for Abyssinia, with the intention of exploring those parts 
which have not hitherto been visited by any European. The senate of

of annual income for the ensuing seven or eight years, as well in acknow- 
ledgement of his former services, as to enable him, agreeably to his wish, to

His Majesty the King of Bavaria, announcing that the collection which His 
Majesty had ordered was, through the care of Professor Martius, now 
ready, and would be delivered to the Society in a short time by the Bava- 
rian ambassador in London, Baron de Cetto. The collection was said to 
consist of upwards of 600 specimens. Mr. Frost, the Professor of Botany, 
then delivered a lecture on the genus jLaurus, a splendid collection of 
which was exhibited to the members, there being no less than eighteen 
living species from His Majesty*s gardens at Kew, furnished by the kindness 
of W. T. Alton, Esq. Besides these, there were thirteen other species, 
contributed by Messrs. Loddiges of Hackney, Mr. Richard Forrest, Mr. 
David Cameron, Mr. Fairbairn, and Mr. Richardson. This genus is par- 
ticularly rich, as it is from it that many valuable medicines are procured, 
such as camphor (Laurus Cdmphora), cinnamon (Laurus Cinnamomura), 
sassafras (Z/aurus Sassafras), bastard cinnamon (Zyaurus Cassia), &c. 

A complete bowl of camphor was exhibited, as also several other pharma- 
ceutical preparations from Mr. Battley. 

The Chairman announced that a vacancy had occurred In the Professor- 
ship of Materia Medica ; candidates for which were requested to send in 
their testimonials as early as possible, as the vacancy would be filled up at 
the ensuing Meeting. 

The Chairman announced that the first fasciculus of the first volume of 
the Transactions of the Society, illustrated with two coloured engravings 
of the Melaleuca Cajuputi and Melaleuca Leucadendron, was now ready 
for delivery to the members. 

The Committee also announced that a paper, on the doubtful identity of 
Bonplandia trifoliata and Angostura Bark, by Dr. John Hancock, would be 
laid before the next Meeting, to be holden July 11. 1828. {Athencsiim.) 

July W. The Society held their last Meeting for the season. After a 
number of presents were announced, and several gentlemen balloted for 
and elected, a paper was read, entitled Remarks on the dovbtful identity of 
JSonpldndia trifoliata, and the Angostura or Carony Bark Tree, by Dr. John 
Hancock. The paper was accompanied by fine native specimens of the 
bark, leaves, flowers, capsules, and seeds of the plant. 

A Dog-faced Baboon, (Simla Hamadryas {hamadryades, nymphs who pre- 
side over trees, and are said to live and die with them, from hama, with, 
drys, the oak), {fig. 151.) died a week or two ago in the Tower, after 
having attracted a great deal 
of attention during its resi- 
dence in that establishment, 
by its extraordinary resem- 
blance to humanity, not only 
in form and appearance, but 
also in its manners and habits. 
The right arm, in particular, 
exhibited a singular likeness 
to the corresponding part of 
the human figure ; so much 
so, indeed, that had it not 
been for its hairy covering, 
and the somewhat unusual 
length of the fingers, the eye, 
at least, might almost have 
mistaken it for a portion of 
some brawny blacksmith, or 
hero of the ring. Our de- 
ceased friend, we understand, used, at all events, to brandish his pot 
of porter by its assistance, in a style that would -have done honour: 
to any of us; and would swill it off) apparently with quite a human relish.

His attentions to a dog that used to be a frequent visitor at his cage, were, 
we are told, in the very best style of dignified patronising ; nor did the little 
favourite seem to recognise any difference between the pat of his brother 
quadruped's paw, and that of the whiter-skinned and shorter-fingered ani- 
mal. This jolly tippler, however, " life's idle business o'er," sunk at last 
under a confirmed dropsy, the effect, we fear, of his plentiful potations, 
leaving only the memory of his fate as a warning to all surviving debauchees.

The Head of a Hippopotamus has recently been brought to England, 
with all the flesh about it, in a high state of preservation. This amphibious 
animal was harpooned while in combat with a crocodile, in a lake in the 
interior of Africa. The head measures near four feet long, and eight feet 
in circumference ; the jaws open two feet wide, and the cutting-teeth, of 
which it has four in each jaw, are above a foot long, and four inches in 
circumference. Its ears are not bigger than a terrier's, and are much about 
the same shape. This formidable and terrific creature, when full-grown, 
measures about 1 7 ft. long from the extremity of the snout to the inser- 
tion of the tail, above 16 ft. in circumference round the body, and stands 
above 7 ft. high. It runs with astonishing swiftness for its great bulk, 
at the bottom of lakes and rivers, but not with as much ease on land. 
When excited, it puts forth its full strength, which is prodigious. " I have 
seen," says a mariner, as we find it in Dampier, " one of these animals 
open its jaws, and seizing a boat between its teeth, at once bite and sink it 
to the bottom. I have seen it on another occasion place itself under one 
of our boats, and rising under it, overset it, with six men who were in it, 
but who, however, happily received no other injury." At one time it was 
not uncommon in the Nile, but now it is no where to be found in that 
river, except above the cataracts. The head is intended as a present to 
His Majesty. — M. C. March 24. 

The Trunk of a Walnut Tree, 1 2 ft. in diameter, hollowed out and furnished 
as a sitting-room, has lately been imported from America, and exhibited in 
London. A printed paper, delivered to spectators, states the tree to have, 
been " unparalleled in size and beauty," the trunk 80 ft. high, without a 
branch, and the entii'e height 150 ft. The bark was 12 in. thick, and the 
branches from 3 to 4 ft. in diameter. It grew at the junction of the Silver 
and Walnut creeks, on the south shore of Lake Erie, in the state of New 
York. — /rf. 

Evils produced by the Birdcatchers in the Vicinity of London. — Sir, It is 
well known that the gardens in and about London are much more injured 
by insects, than those in comparatively distant parts of the country. This, 
in my opinion, is very much owing to the smaller number of insectivorous 
birds in and about the metropolis; and the reason there are so few of these 
is not, as frequently alleged, owing to the smoke, the number of houses, 
and the want of trees and food, because it is well known that every kind of 
bird will live and thrive in cages in the heart of London, but to the num- 
ber of birdcatchers, and, in some respects, to the cats. The cats, perhaps, 
cannot so well be got rid of, on account of their utility within doors; but 
I am persuaded that if the legislature would pass an act to prevent bird- 
xiatchers from exercising their jyt within twenty miles of the metropolis, 
the number of birds would soon be speedily increased, and the number of 
insects in gardens diminished. Neither ought wild birds of any kind to be 
shot, or otherwise caught or destroyed, within this distance, under certain 
penalties ; and the result would be a great increase in their numbers, great 
tameness and familiarity with man, great facilities of studying their habits, 
and a powerful accession of enjoyment to the lovers of ornithology and 
natural song. Kensington Gardens, Regent's Park, Greenwich Park, and 
sdl the squares and the gardens of suburban cottages, would then resound 
with the notes of the mghtingalc, the blackbird, the thrush, and probably 
the canary. — .7. 2?, Futhanij May 5.

. Boletus (bolos, a mass ; globular form). — The curious deformed fungus 
which I send you {Jig. 152.) 
grew for ten years on the oak 
tree whence it was taken. 
Unlike others of the genus, it 
is not a solitary, but an ag- 
gregated or branched pro- 
duction, hence its irregular 
shape, which would well jus- 
tify its being called medus^p- 
forniis. The pores are not 

circular as in the common boletus, but oval; and this, it is thought, 
is a distinction, which separates it from its family, or, at least, is sufficient 
to mark it a subdivision thereof. Notwithstanding this genus seems 
to be one of the lowest of vegetable productions, and apparently one 
of the most useless to mankind, yet some of them have been applied to 
useful purposes ; as the B. igniarius, which is used as a styptic, and also for 
tinder ; and, in all probability, qualities may lie hidden in their uninviting 
forms, which future analysts have yet to discover. — J. A. Botanic Gar^

by the students of the University, seemed at that period to warrant the 
hope that the formation of such a society would be attended with success ; 
and, accordingly, nearly forty members were enrolled during the first year 
of its existence. The principal intention of the founders of the Plinian 
Society was to promote natural history ; but antiquarian researches, and 
the advancement of all the physical sciences, have also been included 
amongst its professed objects. The means which have been adopted for 
the prosecution of the views of the Society are, the reading of papers, 
debates, the formation of a museum and library, and excursions to the 
country, for the examination and collection of objects of natural history. 
Papers have been read on subjects connected with all the departments of 
natural science, more especially on the zoology, botany, geology, mineralogy,

meteorology, and antiquities of Scotland. The library is now extensive, 
and contains many of the modern standard works connected with the 
sciences which the Society cultivates. The museum has made great progress 
and now contains a considerable collection of quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, 
insects, shells, &c.; a numerous general collection of plants, and also a 
remarkably complete herbarium of Scotland ; a valuable collection of simple 
minerals, amounting to 500 specimens, a very perfect series of rocks, and 
more particularly a collection illustrative of the geological structure of 
Scotland ; and a collection of coins, antiquarian relics, &c. It will be 
unnecessary to remark on the flourishing state of this Society, when it is 
stated that it is at present composed of upwards of 180 members. [For the 
above communication we are indebted to Thomas Torrie, Esq., who has

We now insert the remainder of the form which we intend our corre- 
spondents to fill up. We should wish to receive, before the 1st of October, 
all the criticisms on this form, intended to be sent us, in order that we 
may be able to make our final corrections, in time to distribute the skeleton 
letters to our correspondents nt the difierent stations, by the 1st of Novem- 
ber. We are still in want of correspondents for several of the stations, 
and we should be glad to add to those of Europe as many as we can in 
America. 

We consider that the register of this skeleton calendar in this Magazine, 
even if we should never be able to get it filled up to our satisfaction, will 
tend to the advancement of meteorological science ; for, by enabling 
various persons in different countries of Europe and America, to direct 
their attention to the same plants and animals, when at any future period 
their observations are made public, through whatever channel, they will 
admit of a more accurate and useful comparison than has hitherto been 
made. Thus many men, in different places and in different lands, may be 
silently, and unknown to each other, cooperating, in well-directed efforts, to 
attain the same object.

Observations. — Should any of the particulars mentioned under heads 
Flora, Fauna, in the respective months, happen either before or after the 
times they are here expected to occur, such may be noticed in the observ- 
ations under each month. Under the head Meteorology, it is particu- 
larly necessary that not only the commencement and duration of the 
equinoctial gales be marked, but also any decided change of weather, as 
thunder-storms, floods, &c. ; in order that contemporary changes at distant 
stations may be more easily accounted for. 



Art. VI. Calendar of Nature for London, 

June. — Flora. Wheat came into flower on the 16th, the white lily 
on the 22d, and the evening primrose on the 28th. 

Fauna. Young wasps appeared on the 20th j the geometric-web-making 
spider ( Jranea geometrica) on the 25th. About the same time the little 
moths, the larva of which had been so destructive to the foliage of many 
plants, particularly apple trees and white-thorn hedges, came forth from 
their chrysalis state. They prove to be the Phalae^na pyralis of Linnaeus, 
and very much resemble the common small moth so destructive to woollen 
garments and house furniture. The eggs of these insects, it is probable, 
were deposited on the branches near the buds the preceding autumn, or 
early during the very mild spring. 

.Tuly. — Flora. It was near the end of the month before the sunflower, 
hollyhock, and dahlia presented their conspicuous flowers. On the 2 1st 
the large horse-mushroom ( Jgaricus campestris var.) was sold in the streets. 
Except for catsup, this species of mushroom should be cautiously eaten. 
In wet seasons, or if produced on wet ground, it is very deleterious, if used 
in any great quantity. 

Fauna. The nightingale silent on the 1st; the processional moth ap- 
pears on the 3d, laying its eggs, in connected cylinders, round the twigs of 
apple or blackthorn trees ; vast numbers of the /chneumon peregrinator 
fly, with their long, vibrating, clouded antennae, in gardens, in search of dor- 
mant insects, or places where larva are, on which to lay their eggs, about 
the 3d ; hoary beetle (.Scarabae'us solstitialis Lin.) seen on the 9th ; hair 
worm (Gordiu* aquatica Lin.\ plentiful on moist ground, on the 10th. 
About this time the skylark, black-cap, reed and sedge warblers, are the 
principal song-birds heard. Harvest-men (Phalangium Opilio Lin.) appear 
on the 17th, and the carrion beetle (Silpha 4-punctata) on the 28th. This 
last insect may be seen on evenings hoveling under hedges, or in thick 



296 Indicatorial Calendar, 

woods, in search of dead animals, on which it preys and breeds ; colour 
black, with two belts of yellow across each shell. A dead mole seems to 
be its favourite repast. 

August. — Flora. Many of what are called " the solstitial wreath of the 
goddess of flowers'* are still in beauty; to which there are added dahlias, 
hollyhocks, conyolvuli, and all the new splendid varieties of CEnothera, 
Kicotidna, &c., in the gardens. In the fields, and on wastes, foxgloves, 
toadflax, chiccory, &c., are the most striking flowers. 

Fauna. Our song-birds are almost all silent. The black-cap has not 
been heard during the last week. A song-thrush, and now and then a sky- 
lark, may occasionally be heard ; but the general harmony of the woods is 
over. Swifts appear to be directing their flight to the south-westward, the 
wet season urging their departure. Insects do not appear to be so plentiful 
as they are in dry summers ; the common lady-bird (Coccin^lla 7-punctata 
Lin.), is. even rare about London this year, but the C. 2-punctutJE are 
numerous ; neither are aphides so prevalent as they sometimes are. 

The weather y for the last two months, has only been a continuation of that 
which preceded. Unfortunately for the country, but few places have 
escaped heavy and unseasonable rains ; causing floods, and much damage to 
the crops. There must be a particular reason for this weather, which the 
" Perennial Calendar," kept at a suflicient number of points, will be one of 
the most certain means of developing. — J, M. Chelsea, August 15. 



Art. VII. Indicatorial Calendar. 

DuKiNG the next two months, naturalists are on the alert for insects ; and 
the stag, fox, hare, badger, otter, marten, andpolecat, are pursued by sports- 
men. 

Birds. — The pheasant, moorcock, ptarmigan, heathcock, mountain-cock, 
partridge, quail, woodcock,'and land rail, are all the immediate objects of the 
sportsman's attention ; besides all the water birds which come within range 
of his barrel. Even the heavy bustard would not escape, did not its own timi- 
dity keep it afar from the paths of man. Of birds which migrate to other 
countries, the time of their leaving is the only circumstance worth notice. 
The greater number depart in September ; the swallow generally about the 
loth of October ; and thie house and sand martens about eight days later, 
according to the warmth of weather. 

Insects. — The following, among others, maybe met with : Coccinella 
12-punctata; Papilio Machaon and Vanessa wrticae butterflies. Sphinx 
convolvuli (the convolvulus hawk moth) and Sphinx A'tropo* (the death's 
head moth). Also, theT6rtrix tripunctata, and the harvest bugs, Stom6xys 
calcitrans and irritans, may be both seen and felt. Some or all of these 
may also be met with in October; and, in addition,theN6ctuaexoleta(the 
large swbrd-grass moth), the Ge6metra connectaria (the connecting umber), 
and the T^hea gelat<^lla (the autumnal dagger moth). 

The Sea and Fresh-iuater Fish which will be in the London market 
during the next two months, are nearly such as were named for June and 
July, with the addition of cod and herrings. 

Astronomical Remarks. — Two of the superior planets are now particu- 
larly attractive on evenings, soon after sunset ; viz. Jupiter in the south, 
and Mars in the south-east, part of the heavens. The moon will be with 
them ; and the other planets, in the course of the two next months, on the 
days and times following : —

A Call and Answer from some kind of Bird. — ^Travelling through a marshy 
district of Galloway a few evenings ago, my attention was called to a strange 
sound in the air, resembling the bleating of a goat. The evening was 
serene, and remarkably fine for the climate and season of the year, with 
beautiful moonlight; but still I could see no object from which the sound 
could proceed. It seemed first to arise from the marsh, and, rising 
higher and higher in the air, was sometimes overhead, and on each side of 

me, and appeared to be a call and an- 
swer from some kind of bird. It was 
not, indeed, so sweet as I have heard 
the song of the nightingale in the 
south, but, associated as it was with 
the fineness of the evening, was far 
.from disagreeable. On enquiry, I am 
informed that such sounds are always 
[heard about this season ; and that 
they proceed from the male and fe- 
I male birds of what is provincially called 
;the " Heather-blite." Pray what is 
it ? — J. N'. Cally Gardens, April 4 .

$9S Queries and Answers. 

Preserving Specimens of Plants. — Sir, In your reply to the ReT. G, 
Munford's request (p. 196.) for directions on the subject of forming a 
herbarium, you very properly begin by speaking of the method of preserving 
the specimens, which, of course, is almost the first step in the business. 
Having, by experience, found great advantage from the easy method which 
I myself adopt for this purpose, and not knowing whether the same may be 
generally known or practised, I venture to recommend it to Mr. Munford 
and to others, through the medium of your Magazine. The great principle 
to be attended to is, to dri/ the speciynens thoroughly and quickly. Accord- 
ingly, it has more than once been remarked to me by others, that plants 
which have been dried in hot climates, usually retain the largest share of 
their original brilliancy and beauty ; and I have myself found that such spe- 
cimens as I have gathered in the course of a tour, and, for want of other 
conveniences, have merely placed between the leaves of a memorandum- 
book, or the like, and carried in the pocket, have, owing to the warmth of 
the pocket, been better preserved than others more leisurely dried in the 
ordinary way. It is owing to the same cause that I have been able to 
select from a rick of hay that had been well got, and had properly heated,spe- 
cimens that would not disgrace a respectable herbarium. Let the specimens, 
then, be gathered, if possible, when quite dry, and never, on any account, 
put in water, with a view to keep them fresh, after they are gathered, and pre- 
viously to their being pressed between paper; a practice which would tend to 
increase the quantity of moisture in the plants, and, consequently, add to the 
difficulty of drying them. Then take some leaves of coarse blotting-paper, 
the more bibulous the better, and heat them at the fire, till they become as 
hot as they can be made without scorching them. Place the specimens 
separately between two of these leaves, so heated ; lay them between boards 
or other flat surfaces, and press them with a heavy weight. This process of 
heating the paper, and shifting the specimens, should be often repeated, twice, 
or, at least, once a day, till the juices of the plant are evaporated. In this 
manner the specimens, if not very robust or succulent ones, will genei*ally 
be sufficiently dried in the course of a week, or even in less time. The 
advantages of this method are, not only that the specimens will be tho- 
roughly dried in a short time, and therefore will be less liable to become 
mouldy or to decay, but also that they will generally retain the colour, both 
of the flowers and leaves, much more perfectly than when preserved by 
means of a slower process, and without the aid of artificial heat. A few 
years ago, a Swiss botanist of the name of Thomas, visited this country, 
bringing over with him extensive collections of dried alpine plants for sale. 
That eminent naturalist A. H. Haworth, Esq., was so struck with the beauty 
of these specimens, many of which retained the vividness of their colours 
almost as perfectly as when they were in a living state, that he was induced 
to ask M. Thomas what means he adopted in their preservation. Without 
making any mystery of the art, M. Thomas readily communicated to him 
the above-mentioned process of heating the paper ; and it is to the kindness 
of my friend Mr. Haworth that I am indebted for the knowledge of it. —

Preserving Specimens of Natural History. — Information on this subject 
being requested by T. A. of Portsmouth, G. H. Ludlow, R. V. of Cork, and

argely to this work, and was enabled to explain the different methods, by 
attending at the laboratory in the Jardin du Roi at Paris. The appendix to 
Mr. Waterton's Wanderings, a book which every naturalist ought to read, 
contains some original and valuable information on preserving birds, and we 
intend to abridge it in a future Number. 



Queries and Afiswers. 299 

Skulls of Brutes, — Can you, or any of your correspondents, inform me 
whether or not the skulls of brutes are in two tables, in the manner of those 
of the human race? — C. Mai/, 1828. 

The human Voice. — I have been always wont to regard the human voice, 
with its inflections and the various other phenomena of speech, as one of 
the most distinctive and wonderful things which belong to human nature ; 
and I have always been proportionally curious to know what is most par- 
ticularly wanting in the throats and lungs of the higher classes of animals, 
especially those which approach nearest to ourselves, that hinders them 
from imitating us, and that makes even the most docile of them unteach- 
able in this way. Why beasts do not speak the language of man, is not the 
question I would propose, but why (as is evident) they cannot. Whether 
it is owing, to use a musical phrase, to their want of ear ; whether, to use 
a philosophical one, it results from their want of understanding ; or whether, 
as I am apt to think, it arises from the want of a proper conformation of 
the organs most necessary in speaking ? Now, if any of your correspond- 
ents could be induced to favour me with a little comparative anatomy or 
reasoning, which would go to the elucidation of this point, I am sure it 
could not fail of being interesting to many of your readers, but particularly 
to your correspondent. — Id. 

Starivort^ as a Remedy for sickly Bees. — Sir, Grahame, in his British 
Georgics, p. 126., describes a plant, under the name of " starwort," as a 
remedy for sickly bees. Our " husbandmen" do not seem to be acquainted 
with the herb, nor is my knowledge of botany extensive enough to enable 
me to determine what it is. I shall, therefore, feel obliged to any cor- 
respondent who can give me its botanical name ; and the obligation will be 
much increased if he can also inform me that experience has confirmed its 
healing virtues. That it is not the " starwort'' of botanists, the appended 
description will sufficiently show : — 

" In meadows grows a flower, by husbandmen 
Called starwort; easily it may be known. 
For, springing from a single root, it spreads 
A foliage affluent, golden-hued itself. 
While, from the leaves of darkest violet, 
An under-tint of lighter purple shines : 
Harsh to the taste, it wrings the shepherd's mouth :

The Glowworm. — Sir, In the review of Murray's Researches in Natural 
History, in the last Number of your Magazine, I find the following passage 
concerning the glowworm, iampyris noctiluca (from nox, night, lucv^, a 
light; and not from noctiluca, a candle, as in the review) : — '* Their light, 
which they have power to extinguish at pleasure, proceeds from brilliant 
spots on the three last rings of the body, under the tail ; the luminous mat- 
ter is a yellow substance, contained in vesicles, and when these vesicles are 
removed entire, they shine for some time afterwards, but if lacerated they 
are extinguished." This passage brought to my recollection a circumstance 
which is probably not worth relating, but which interested me ; it might 
be from my ignorance of the subject. I was, with a large party, returning 
at a late hour of the night, from Richmond theatre, to Ham, when we ob- 
served a number of glowworms in the path : their unusual number engaged 
our attention, and a young lady stooping to take up one in her hand, ob- 
served that she had hurt it, and passed on. Two of us stayed to look at 
the wounded worm, which had become exceedingly luminous ; we traced 
its passage on the earth, by a train of light yet more vivid than its unbroken 
lamp, and still extending in length. I do not, at this distance of time, re-

member whether we were one minute, or two, or three, but we continued 
watching it, until afraid of being quite distanced by the rest of the party. 
It was very unwillingly that we left it, while its light was yet burning and 
increasing; the worm had moved in a circular direction, and the ring 
of light (I think about 1 ft. in diameter), was very nearly completed ; we 
wished to have seen it quite completed, and what direction it would next 
take. The light had become somewhat fainter towards the beginning of 
the track, and its continuity was broken in two or three places. This light 
proceeded, I suppose, from the yellow substance discharged from the 
wounded vesicles, and the interruptions were caused by the partial drying 
up of that substance ; but what occasioned so extraordinary an expansion 
of light, together with an increased brilliancy ? This, and its circular di- 
rection excited my attention and interest. 1 have no knowledge of ento- 
mology, and am very likely speaking of a mere common-place ; in this case, 
you may please to make my communication more luminous than you find 
it : should you insert it in your Magazine, some of your readers may be 
disposed, through the same medium, to enlighten. Sir, yours, — A. A. 

Orobdnche minor. — Is Orobanche minor a parasitical plant? In the 
clover fields in this neighbourhood, where it abounds, it does not appear 
to be attached to any other plant ; but in my garden, this year, I had several 
plants, and the roots were so firmly attached to those of Prenanthes mu- 
riilis, that it was impossible to separate them, without destroying the fibres 
of their respective roots. — D. Stock. Bungay ^ July 28. 1828. 

The Worm of Corruption. — In a narrative in the Times newspaper of 
July 28., of the disinterment of the body of the patriot Hampden, in Hamp- 
den church, Buckinghamshire, in July, 1828, and where it had been buried 
in June, 1643, it is stated that " the skull was in some places perfectly bare, 
whilst in others the skin remained nearly entire, upon which we discovered 
a number of maggots and small red worms on the feed with great activity. 
This was the only spot where any symptoms of life were apparent, as if the 
brain contained a vital principle within it which engendered its own de- 
struction ; otherwise how can we account, after a lapse of nearly two cen- 
turies, for finding living creatures preying upon the seat of intellect, when 
they were nowhere else to be found, — in no other part of the body ?" Can 
you, or any of your correspondents, throw any light on this subject ? What 
are the names of the insects or worms ? Do the maggots ever become 
winged insects ? and if so, how do they escape ? Or do they die in the 
larva or in the chrysalis state ? How do their eggs get there ? and if there 
before the body was deposited, how does it happen that they remain so 
many years before being hatched, seeing the nidus must have been equally 
ifavourable for hatching at any one period during the last 1 50 years at least ?

The Red and White Lychnis dioica. — Sir James Smith much wished to 
find a distinction between the Red and White iychnis dioica. I have 
observed the pistils to be much larger in the latter, and I would ask if the 
stigmas have ever been found revolute. — W. H., R.N, Yeovil^ August 5.

Knowledge of Fossils. — I beg to be informed of the best plan of obtmn- 
ing a knowledge of fossils. To myself, and, probably, to many of your 
readers, a description of the genus and order to which they belong, and in 
what formation they are to be found, if accompanied by engravings similar 
to those that adorn your work, would be highly acceptable to others as well 
as to. Sir, yours, &c. — Vectis. Isle of Wight^ Aug. 2. 1828. 

Rearing young Pheasants. — I should be obliged if any of your corre- 
spondents could inform me of the best mode of rearing young pheasants, as 
I find, after having atten)pted to rear some for two seasons, that they die 
oft" very suddenly as they are throwing out their crop and tail feathers, 
without any appearance of being any way sick or aflected. I feed them very

plentifully on ants and their eggs, as well as on other insects, and they are 
kept on a grass-plot, and removed daily. — Id. 

Gordius aqudticiis. — I have now in my possession a Gordiu* aquaticus 
Linn., which was pumped up a few months ago, from a well, near Knutsford 
in Cheshire. It is about 7 in. in length, and of the thickness of a pin ; the 
body is smooth, and of equal dimensions throughout ; the colour is dark 
brown, with black at the extremities. It lived for three or four weeks sub- 
sequent to its being in my possession, during which time it was kept in a 
vessel of water ; but I was at a loss how to afford it any nourishment 
beyond what it might derive from the water ; and, after the time I mention 
had elapsed, it became weaker, performed none of those surprising twists 
and convolutions which had distinguished the earlier part of its captivity ; 
and I at last put it into a bottle containing spirits. There seemed no dif- 
ference, that I could discover (at least with any magnifying powers I used), 
between the head and tail of the animal. It manifested no particular 
inclination or disinclination for clay, when introduced into the vessel, 
though I find some authors assert that it makes a habitation of it at certain 
seasons. I should be glad to hear from some of your correspondents, who 
are acquainted with the habits and mode of living of the Gordiujr, some 
more particulars on the subject, through the medium of your valuable jour- 
nal. — H.

The least WoodjJecker not rare near Coventry. — At p. 83. of your Maga- 
zine an extract is given from the Tyne Mercury y stating that a fine specimen 
of the least woodpecker (Picus minor) was shot in the neighbourhood of 
Newcastle ; and it is added, that this is " perJiaps tlie only specimen known 
to be British.** The bird is by no means of very rare occurrence in this 
neighbourhood (Warwickshire). Twice, within this last fortnight only, 
have I gone out of the house to listen to it, having been attracted by its 
well-known and amusing noise. It is, indeed, a bird more readily heard 
than seen. Its diminutive size and shy habits are perhaps among the causes 
of its being supposed by some to be a rarer species than it really is. Its 
loud, rapid, vibratory noise, most extraordinarily loud to be produced by 
so small an animal, can hardly fail to arrest the attention of the most 
unobserving ear. Though I have watched the bird during the operation, 
and within the distance of a few yards, I am quite at a loss to account for 
the manner in which the noise is produced. It resembles that made by the 
boring of a large auger through the hardest wood ; and hence the country 
people sometimes call the bird the " pump-borer." — W, T. Bree. Allesley

The Vignette on the Covet'. — When I received your Magazine of Natural 
History, my eyes were first attracted by the picturesque outside of the book, 
and I found the selection of the individuals of the vignette, which I may call 
the " coat of arms " of naturalists, well adapted to the work. But I have a 
great objection to the composition of the subjects, which many of your 
readers, and you yourself, perhaps, may regard as trifling. That composi- 
tion, however, by a nearer contemplation of the objects, assumes a more 
serious appearance ; for the picture, I presume, is made on purpose to give 
at first sight a correct idea of the contents of the book. How offensive, 
therefore, to the eye of the connoiseur, to see that the composition of the 
drawing is quite incorrect, and how much must it diminish the real merit 
of the work, to see that the Conductor of the Magazine of Natural History 
makes such a blunder against nature, and seems not to combine knowledge 
of zoology with that of geographical botany !

Retrospective Criticism, 



My objection is, that the lion and the elephant, which, as every body 
knows, are natives of a hot climate, rest under the gloomy branches of an 
old fir, indigenous to the coldest north, and that the eagle, the owl, and 
the chamois, inhabitants of cold, woody, and rocky countries, are sheltered 
by lofty palms. This, in my opinion, is an unpardonable fault against na- 
ture. 

The picture would, therefore, appear much more correct if the indivi- 
duals had been drawn under their native trees, and it would, at all events, 
improve at least the outside of your truly valuable Magazine. {W. H. A 
Lover of Nature.) 




This is perfectly fwr criticism ; but that the geographical error m ques- 
tion does not proceed from ignorance will appear by referring to our origi- 
nal prospectus, criticised by Z. B., in No. I. p. 94., an impression of which 
we here introduce, {fig. 159.) How in the improved cut the eagle came to 
be transferred from under the fir or cedar, to under the palm, was owing to 
the employment of two artists, one for the animals, and another for the 
trees, &c., in making a new drawing, and this drawing was engraved before 
we had an opportunity of seeing it. A corrected and improved vignette 



Retrospective Criticism, ' 303 

has been in progress for some time, and, if not ready for this Number, it will 
certainly be so in time for the titlepage of the volume. We sincerely thank 
W. H. for his criticism; it would have been easy to have made the correc- 
tion and said nothing about it, but we have introduced his letter at length, 
because we wish to show our young readers, that, in looking at even so 
small a matter as an ornamental vignette, there is a great difference in the 
number and kind of ideas which arise in the mind of a man of general 
knowledge and taste, and those which present themselves to a mind, which 
to this general knowledge and taste has added the science specifically be- 
longing to the subjects inspected. — Cond. 

Superstition relating to Bees. — On further enquiry, I find that the super- 
stitious practice, which I formerly mentioned, of informing the bees of a 
death that takes place in a famil}', is very well known, and still prevails 
among the lower orders in this country. The disastrous consequence to be 
apprehended from noncompliance with this strange custom, I now un- 
derstand to be, not (as before stated) that the bees will desert the hive, 
but that they will dwindle and die. The manner of communicating the 
intelligence to the little community, with due form and ceremony, I am 
told is this : to take the key of the house, and knock with it three times 
against the hive, telling the inmates, at the same time, that their master or 
mistress, &c., (as the case may be) is dead ! — W.T. Bree. AUesley Rectory, 
July 9. 1828. 

Fsalm-singing to Bees. — When in Bedfordshire lately, we were informed 
of an old man who sang a psalm last year in front of some hives which were 
not doing well, but which he said would thrive in consequence of that cere- 
mony. Our informant could not state whether this was a local or indivi- 
dual superstition. — Cond. 

Translation and Derivation of Technical Terms. — Sir, I am surprised to 
see you found fault with by your correspondent A. (p. 200.), for giving the 
derivations of technical words, enclosed between parentheses, in the body 
of the page. It will be admitted, I suppose, by all, that it is both useful 
and agreeable to know the meaning of the words we employ. Many of the 
technical terms of science are not always immediately obvious, even to 
those who have a knowledge of Latin and Greek; and to such as do not 
possess that advantage, the words in question, unless they are explained, 
must generally be downright hard words without meaning, and, as such, 
prove impediments to the acquisition of knowledge. It may often happen, 
too, that when a word is fully known as to its bare etymology, still the 
drift and propriety of its application to the particular plant or animal to 
which it belongs may be far from apparent, till pointed out. In defence of 
your own practice, you very justly say that " the translations and deriv- 
ations are likely to have the best chance of being remembered, when given 
where they occur." Might you not go further, and say that in this way 
they have not only the best chance of being remembered^ but the best 
chance of being knoivn, or even read at all ? Whatever inconvenience may 
arise to the reader, from the introduction of these parentheses in the body 
of the page (and I do not deny that some slight interruption is hereby occa- 
sioned), still, the inconvenience complained of appears to me quite trifling, 
compared with that of being continually obliged to turn to a glossary at the 
end of the Number to find the meaning of a word ; and rather than sub- 
mit to such a disagreeable interruption, your readers, I suspect, will be con- 
tent, oftentimes at least, to remain in ignorance of the meaning of many 
a technical word they meet with. I should not have troubled you on this 
subject, were it not that you say, " If other readers are of the same opinion 
as your correspondent A., you shall relinquish the practice." Now, I do 
hope. Sir, that, for the reasons given above, you will not relinquish the 
practice, but continue the same plan with which you have commenced. At 
the same time I wish to observe that an index or glossary of translations

and derivations introduced, aS you propose, at the end of the volume, will 
be of the greatest utility and advantage, for the purpose of ready reference 
at any time it may be required. — B. Coventri/y July 1 2. 

Having received several letters on this subject, all highly approving of 
the plan which we have hitherto adopted, we intend persevering in that 
plan. — Cond. 

Ignis Fatuus. — If I may be allowed to remark on the review of Mur- 
ray's Researchesy &c. (p. 156.), I would observe that I can certify the exist- 
ence of the ignis fatuus, and also that it appears " as a glow of lambent 
flame." Two of these phenomena made their appearance on the evening of 
the 26th of October, 182 J, on board the Sandwich packet, on our passage 
from the West Indies to England, when about 200 miles north of the Ba- 
hamas, and remained, one at the spindle of each mast-head, for about two 
hours ; the atmosphere being in a very unsettled state, with rain and light- 
ning. The one at the main-mast-head was rather brighter than the other, 
and, before disappearing, occasionally passed up and down the upper part of 
the mast, but never entirely disengaging itself, notwithstanding the heavy 
motion of the vessel. 

On " the luminosity of the sea*^ I would just say, that its appearance pre- 
vious to a storm is a very old observation amongst sailors. It is, however, 
I think, without foundation, as it is to be seen, more or less, all the year 
round, in the Carribean sea, where there are no storms but in the hurricane 
months. In the hand it has a kind of mucous feel. — W. H., R. N.^ Yeovil. 
August 5. 

The Spider. — The remarks on the spider, in the review of Murray's 
Researches (p. 157.), were peculiarly interesting to me, as I have often held 
a leaf in my hand, to which a spider had fixed his line, and have seen the 
spider floating in the wind, at a great distance, and returning again with 
surprising velocity. It has often gone to so great a distance, that I have 
thought the line had broken, and yet he returned again upon this singu- 
larly strong and delicate web. One day last week I amused myself for more 
than an hour in observing the foceedings of a little spider, whose bag of 
eggs had been removed and restored. I do not feel quite sure as to the 
species, but, if I can ascertain that, I think it would make an interesting 
paragraph, to detail what I then observed. — A. A. 

The late Mr. Sowerby. — At p. 198., I have observed that some well- 
meaning friend, desirous of doing a service to the memory of my lamented 
father, in claiming for him his share of the honour due for the execution of 
that national work the English Botany, has rather overshot the mark ; Mr. 
Sowerby was not the author of any part of the text of English Botany 
(erroneously called English Flora). The work owed its origin to the cir- 
cumstance of Mr. Sowerby having made a number of sketches of plants, to 
be introduced in the foregrounds of landscapes, which he was in the habit 
of painting from nature. These sketches were shown to various botanical 
friends, at whose suggestion the work was begun, with the valuable assist- 
of Sir J. E. Smith ; and the only descriptions that were not written by that 
gentleman, were supplied by the late Dr. Shaw. In addition to the praise 
due to Mr. Sowerby, for the excellence of the drawing and engravings in 
that work, some portion is due to him for the spint of enterprise with 
which he carried it on ; for, although he had to depend upon nortrait-paint- 
ing for the capital re(iuired, he still industriously and steadily pursued his 
expensive project, until it began to remunerate him (which was not for 
several years), and he finally brought up a numerous family to enjoy its pro- 
fits, and lament the loss of one of the best of parents. I remain, Sir, &c. —

Art. I. On the Metamorphoses 'of the Reproductive Bodies of 
some A.'lgce, said to possess successively/ an Animal and a Vege- 
table Existence, By A. 

One of the most extraordinary opinions now supported by 
various naturalists, is that which maintains a twofold vitality 
in a certain class of bodies, or, in other words, both an ani- 
mal and a vegetable existence. Some very celebrated names 
have lent their testimony to confirm this opinion, and it is 
asserted that many of their conclusions are the results of actual 
experiment. It is true, they do not assert that any individual 
body is at once both an animal and a vegetable, but they do 
assert that it passes from an animal to a vegetable state with- 
out disorganisation. 

" There are phenomena in the kingdom of nature," ob- 
serves Professor Nees von Esenbeck (as quoted in the Annales 
des Sciences Nafmrlles), " which can hardly require too fre- 
quently repeated experiments, and which, when proved, demand 
the support of numerous recorded authorities. For, as the 
phenomena in question appear to contradict certain principles 
admitted into the reigning systems, we often prefer rather to 
deny the conclusions of candid and experienced observers, than 
to receive what has hitherto been regarded as untenable by 
generally received authority. 

" In this situation are placed all observations upon the 
transition, or metamorphosis, of vegetable life (which is charac- 
terised by immobility) into animal life (distinguished by mo- 
tion) ; the moment when a being, arrived at the period of its 
existence, continues itself, as it were, by a new creation, and 
the animated embryo developes itself into a motionless vege- 
table." 

Vol. I. — No. 4. y 



306 Metamorphoses of the 

Among the naturalists who have laboured in this new and 
singular field, Professor !Nees von Esenbeck must be placed 
foremost on the list, as he was the first to publish his observ- 
ations, in a distinct manner, in the year 1814. Since that 
period, Treviranus, Ditmar, Agardh, Bory de Saint- Vin- 
cent, Gruithuisen, Carus, Gaillon, Desmazieres, and others, 
have endeavoured to substantiate the truth of the pheno- 
menon. 

The tribe of Oscillatoriae, forming a part of Agardh's great 
group of Confervoideae, or jointed ^'Igae, are well known to 
have derived their name from the oscillating motion of the 
filaments. Nothing is more easy than to perceive this motion, 
and the Oscillatoriae, consequently, are held in a dubious 
point of view by all botanists. M. Vaucher, of Geneva, who 
published a Histoire des CoTifeyves d'eau douce, noticed such a 
difference between the two extremities of the filaments in some 
species, that he denominates one the head, and the other the 
tail. 

Professor Agardh, of Lund, who has directed his attention 
chiefly to the A^gas, published, a few years ago, an ingenious 
essay upon the metamorphoses of many species. To show how 
far he has carried his observations, it will be sufficient to men- 
tion that, in his I^cones Algdrnm ineditce, fasc. 1. 1. 10., he has 
represented the vegetable form of Oscillatoria flexuosa, and 
also the animalcules into which the filaments are at length 
converted. 

There can be no doubt, that the colouring matter of the 
famous red snow (named Protococcus nivalis by Agardh), 
brought from- the arctic regions by Captain Ross and Captain 
Parry, is a true vegetable, belonging to the order ^'Igae. It 
grows upon limestone rocks, * tufts of moss, dead leaves, and 
even on the bare soil. The singularity of the situation, how- 
ever, in which it was first discovered, that of pure snow, gave 
rise to speculations regarding its origin. Professor Nees von 
Esenbeck was inclined to think that the minute red globules, 
of which the plant consists, were the vegetable state of bodies 
which had gone through a prior animal existence, and perhaps 
of atmospheric origin. 

Baron Wrangel, who discovered the Protococcus nivalis 
growing upon limestone (without knowing at the time that it 
was the true red snow), studied it very carefully. He men- 
tions that the red crust was soon detached when placed under 
water, and a number of much smaller globules, of a yellow or 
pale colour, made their appearance, of which the larger red 
globules seemed to be composed. After a lapse of three days 
the globules became animated, like infusory animalcules ; they 



Reprodiidive Bodies of some Klgce, 307 

swam about, and were frequently pursued and devoured by 
other Infusoria. 

It is worthy of remark, that Agardh does not mention hav- 
ing observed any such motion in the globules ; neither does 
Mr. Bauer : and Dr. Greville, who has published a very full 
history and analysis of the plant in his Cryptogamic Flora, 
did not perceive it. The appearance of vitality, therefore, in 
this instance, was probably owing to some illusion. 

The most precise observations ever made upon this curious 
subject, are the recent ones by M. Franz Unger, of whose 
account it may be desirable to give a translation in his own 
words. In this country, the very idea of such metamorphoses 
is almost startling; and, at first, will probably be regarded as 
visionary, and rejected accordingly. I trust, however, the 
present article will have the effect of inducing a few indivi- 
duals, at least, to commence a series of observations for them- 
selves. 

" I found," says M. Franz Unger, " near Vienna, in a ditch 
containing some clear water derived from the recent melting 
of the snow, a Conferva, which, after cleansing from the clay 
which surrounded it, I deposited in a glass vase, and placed 
in a window, where I could observe without disturbing it. 
This was on the 5th of March, 1826. Two da3's afterwards, 
I noticed the production of a crowd of new ramuli, several 
lines in height, and rising from the general mass like a fine 
green miniature sward. On the 9th, these filaments produced 
fructification in the form of a darker green globule at their 
summits, by which I knew my plant to be the Conferva dila- 
tata var. |3 of Roth, or the Ectosperma clavata of Vaucher. 

" As I continued my observations, I happened to look at 
the surface of the water, and was not a little astonished to find 
it covered, especially towards the side of the vase, with minute 
globules, unequal both in colour and size. Many of them 
swam freely here and there, moving, at their option, in one way 
or another, retiring and approaching one another, gliding 
rountl globules that were motionless, stopping, and again 
setting themselves in motion exactly like animated beings. 

" Conjecturing the identity of the green globules that pos- 
sessed motion with those that had none, I immediately began 
to examine whence these infusory animalcules derived their 
origin, and what relation they bore to the green globules and 
the fructification of the Conferva. 

" The next day I perceived a great number of the globules 
aggregated around the bubbles of gas disengaged from the Con- 
ferva, and floating at the surface. They were some of them 
of a dark green colour, and either round or elongated ; others

more transparent, tumid, and with one or two appendages 
diverging from, or at right angles with each other ; these were 
evidently plants in a state of germination : other globules, again, 
were oval, very dark at one extremity, and almost transparent 
at the other; theSe swam about freely. 

" Within the space of one hour, I succeeded in tracing not 
only the diminution of vitality, and death of the Infusoria, but 
also the subsequent developement of the dead animals into 
germinating plants, in such a manner as to establish the truth 
of the fact. But, on the 12th of March, I had the pleasure of 
ascertaining distinctly the origin of these minute bodies. I 
undertook to observe, without interruption, one of the tubercles 
of fructification, which I have already mentioned as terminat- 
ing the filaments, in order to discover what became of the 
green matter enclosed within it. I had observed it for the 
space of half an hour, when the following changes ( fig, 160. 
abed) became perceptible : — 

*' The globule became gradually darker in its colour, and a 
little transparent at its extremity ; in the middle it was evi- 
dently somewhat contracted, and had some trace of sponta- 
neous motion. I could scarcely believe my eyes, when I per- 
ceived the contraction to become more decided, and a cavity 
to be formed at the base. The contraction at length divided 
the globule into two smaller globules, which moved sponta- 
neously towards the summit. As the developements proceeded, 
the cavity and the uppermost globule became enlarged, while 
the inferior globule became diminished. The latter at length 
disappeared, and the remaining large globule escaped by a 
terminal orifice, ascending till it reached the surface of the 
water. The whole of this process occupied about thirty se- 
conds ; but, from subsequent observations, it may be stated 
generally to take up one minute."

M. Franz Unger ascertained, also, that the period of animal 
existence enjoyed by these globules (or monades, as he calls 
them) is about one hour. The first sign of this portion of their 
life having ceased is, a change from the oval to the globular 
form, and an equal diffusion of the green colouring matter. 
In about six hours, the globule has become nmch more trans- 
parent, and puts forth an appendage, and on the third day a 
second one, by which the young plant becomes fixed to the 
side of the glass vase, or any other body in contact with it.

Essay 2. On the Living Principle and its Effects ; on Organisation 
and Muscular Motion ; and on Sensation, and the Intellectual 
Faculties and Instincts of Animals, By B. ca/tZzMi^^^/^^c^/T^y^^y^ 

In the preceding essay I selected, from the introduction 
to Cuvier's Regne Animal, his descriptions of those parts of 
the animal physiology that were necessary to explain the prin- 
ciples on which his four grand divisions of animals, the verte- 
hrated, the molluscous, the articulated, and the radiated, are 
founded. There are other parts of physiology, which, with 
what has been already given, may be regarded as form- 
ing the very rudiments of the natural history of organised 
sentient beings. These are, for the most part, concisely and 
luminously described by our author ; and I think it desirable 
to state them to the English reader, before we proceed to his 
farther description and subdivisions of vertebrated animals. 

Without some acquaintance with the leading facts in phy- 
siology, we can have no scientific knowledge of zoology, or 
of the principles on which a natural system of classification 
should be founded. As well might we expect to learn the 
mechanism of different timepieces, by a mere inspection of 
the dial-plates and the cases in which they are enclosed, as to 
gain a scientific knowledge of living beings, by only looking 
at their external forms. The principles of a new science, 
however clearly they may be stated, are never thoroughly 
understood until a practical application of them has been 
made. We then turn to them again, and perceive their full 
force and meaning. This is even the case with the axioms in 
geometry. I think it necessary to premise these remarks, 
lest any of our readers should deem this part of the subject 
less inviting than what is to succeed.

The descriptions of the different classes and orders of ani- 
mals in the following essays will be illustrated by references 
to cuts, and such explanations will be added as, I trust, will 
be generally intelligible. 

The definition which Cuvier gives of the living principle is 
rather a description of its effects than of its essence, which 
must ever remain an impenetrable mystery. If, says he, 
we would form a just idea of the essence of life, and observe 
it in those beings where its effects are the most simple, we 
shall perceive that it consists in the faculty which certain or- 
ganised bodies have of existing for a certain time, under a 
determinate form, by incessantly absorbing into their own 
composition a part of the surrounding substances, and by 
giving back to the elements a portion of their own proper 
substance. Life is, therefore, a more or less complicated agi- 
tation or vortex {toii7'billoii), constantly going on in a certain 
direction, and carrying with it molecules of the same kind, but 
into which other individual molecules are continually entering 
or passing out ; so that the form of the living body is more 
essential to it than the matter. When this vital motion finally 
ceases, the body dies, and the elements of which it was com- 
posed separate and are again subjected to common chemical 
affinities, and decomposition speedily takes place. Hence, it 
appears, that the living principle possesses the important power 
of suspending or changing the laws of chemical affinity ; for 
it was this power that prevented the putrefaction or decom- 
position of the living body, and united its elementary mole- 
cules. 

All living bodies die after a period, the extreme term of 
which is fixed for each species. Death appears to be a neces- 
sary effect of life, for the vital motion insensibly changes the 
bodies in which it acts, so as to render their permanent con- 
tinuance impossible. 

The living body experiences gradual but continual changes 
during its whole existence. At first it increases in size, accord- 
ing to certain proportions and limits fixed for each species, 
and for each of its parts. After the parts are full grown, they 
increase in density. It is this second change which appears 
to be the cause of natural death. 

The process which terminates in what Cuvier describes as 
natural death, consists not only in the increase of density, but 
of hardness, and goes on until the fibres and vessels are con- 
verted into bone : it is called ossification, and has been well 
described by Dr. Armstrong : — 

** Life glows meantime amid the grinding force 
Of viscous fluids and clastic tubes;

Its various functions vigorously are plied 

By strong machinery ; and in solid health 

The man confirmed long triumphs o'er disease. 

But the full ocean ebbs ; there is a point 

By nature fixed, whence life must downwards tend ; 

For still the beating tide consolidates 

The stubborn vessels, more reluctant still 

To the weak throbs of the ill supported heart. 

This languishing, these strengthening by degrees, 

To hard, unyielding, unelastic bone. 

Through tedious channels the congealing flood 

Crawls lazily, and hardly wanders on ; 

It loiters still, and now it stirs no more. 

This is the period few attain, the death 

Of nature. Thus (so Heaven ordained it) life 

Destroys itself; and could these laws have changed, 

Nestor might now the fates of Troy relate, 

And Homer live immortal as his song." 

Art of Preserving Health, book ii. 

To return to our author, all living bodies, he observes, 
require to have solid parts to preserve the form, and fluid 
parts to keep up the internal motion. Their texture [tissu) 
is therefore composed of network [reseanx) and of plates 
{mailles), or of fibres and solid laminae {lames solides\ vi^hich 
enclose liquids in their interstices. It is in the liquids that the 
vital motion is the most constant and extended. Foreign sub- 
stances penetrate the intimate structure of the body, by incor- 
porating with the liquids. It is the latter which nourish the 
solids, by interposing their molecules among them ; it is the 
liquids which also detach the superfluous molecules from the 
solids ; it is under a liquid or gaseous form that the matter, 
which requires to be exhaled, traverses the pores of the living 
body ; but it is the solids that contain the liquids, and which, * 
by their contractions, communicate to them a part of their 
motion. 

This mutual action of the solids and fluids, this passage of 
the molecules from one to the other, made a great similarity 
of chemical composition necessary for both ; and, accordingly, 
we find that the solids of organised bodies, both vegetable and 
animal, are, in a great part, composed of elements susceptible 
of taking easily a gaseous or liquid form. The motion of the 
liquids requiring a continually repeated action of the solids, it 
was necessary that the solids should possess flexibility and 
dilation, and this is a nearly general character of organised 
solids. 

This structure, which is common to all living beings, this 
porous texture {tissu areolaire), of which the fibres or laminae 
are more or less flexible, and enclose liquids in greater or less 
abundance, is what is called organisation. No unorganised

material bodies can partake of life. Life in general supposes 
organisation in general, and the proper life of each being sup- 
poses an organisation proper for that being. We never ob- 
serve life but in beings completely organised, and made to 
enjoy it ; and all the efforts of philosophers have not been able 
to show matter either organising itself, or becoming organised 
by an exterior cause. 

The birth of organised beings is, therefore, the greatest 
mystery of organic economy, and of all nature. We see them 
develope themselves, but we never see their formation. All 
those whose origin we can trace, have belonged at first to a 
body of the same form as themselves, but developed before 
them, or, in other words, to a parent. Before the being has 
individual life, when it partakes that of its parent, it is called 
a germ ; the separation of the germ is what is called generation. 
All organised beings produce their like; without this, death 
being, as before stated, a necessary consequence of life, the 
species would become extinct. Organised beings possess, in 
a variable degree peculiar to each species, the power of repro- 
ducing certain parts which may be lost; this is called the 
power of 7'eproduction. 

The developement of organised beings is more or less rapid 
and extended, accordingly as circumstances are more or less 
favourable to their growth. Temperature, and the abundance 
or kind of food, may affect either the whole body, or certain 
parts : hence the resemblance of the progeny to their parents 
can never be perfect. The differences of this kind form what 
are called varieties. 

We have no proof that all the differences which distinguish 
living beings can ever have been produced by circumstances, 
as Darwin and others have maintained. Experience appears 
to show, on the contrary, that, in the present state of the 
globe, the varieties are comprised in narrow limits ; and, as far 
as we can remount into antiquity, we see that these limits were 
the same as at present. We are, ^erefore, obliged to admit 
the existence of certain forms, which have been perpetuated 
since the creation {depuis Vorigiiie des choses), without ex- 
ceeding these limits ; and all the beings belonging to one of 
these forms constitute what is called a species : the varieties 
are accidental divisions of the species. According to Cuvier, 
generation being the only means of knowing the limits to 
which varieties may extend, a species should be defined the 
reunion of all the individuals descended from covimoii parents^ 
and of those isohich resemble them as much as they resemble each 
other. 



Cuvierian System of Zoology. 3 1 3 

Cuvier, however, admits that the application of this definition 
to certain individuals may be very difficult, where necessary 
experiments have not been made. In few countries have 
experiments on the different species of domestic animals been 
more extensively made than in England, and it has been ascer- 
tained that almost any accidental variety of form may be per- 
petuated, by selecting and breeding in succession, for four or 
five generations, from the individuals that possess it. Thus, 
several distinct races of horses, sheep, bulls, and pigs, have 
been formed within the last sixty years, which will remain 
permanent, if the breeds be preserved fi*om admixture with 
other varieties ; but these breeds do not constitute species. 

The functions of organic life, described in the preceding 
part of this essay, are common to all organised living bodies, 
whether animal or vegetable: they consist, says Cuvier, of 
absorption, assimilation, exhalation, growth, and generation. 
Birth and death are the universal limits of the existence of 
organised bodies. The essential condition of their . structure 
is a porous or fibrous texture, containing within it {dans ses 
mailles) liquids or gases in motion. The essential parts of 
their chemical composition consist of substances which are 
almost all convertible into liquids or gas, and of combinations 
which can easily change into each other. Fixed forms, which 
are perpetuated by generation, distinguish their species, and 
determine the complication of the secondary functions proper 
to each, and assign to them the part they are destined to per- 
form in the assemblao^e of universal beings. These forms 
neither produce nor change themselves ; life supposes their 
existence : it cannot be kindled but in organic bodies com- 
pletely prepared for its reception ; and the most profound 
meditations, as well as the most delicate observations, terminate 
in the mystery of the preexistence of germs. 

It has been before stated, that the principal chemical ele- 
ments of which organised bodies are composed are oxygen^ 
hydrogen^ and carbon^ and that animal bodies contain an addi- 
tional element, azote. In animal bodies there are three forms 
of organic texture (tissu), the cellular {la cellulosite), the 
muscular fibre, and the cerebral or medullary texture. 

The cellular texture is composed of an infinite number of 
minute laminae, placed without regularity, and forming small 
cells, which are open to each other. It is a kind of sponge, 
which has the same form as the whole body, and all the other 
parts fill it or traverse it. Its property is to contract indefi- 
nitely, when the causes which kept it extended cease to act. 
The cellular texture compressed, forms those more or less 
extended laminae called membranes ; the membranes, when 



314 Ciwierian System of Zoology, 

folded round, form those tubes called vessels, which are more 
or less ramified ; the filaments called fibres may be resolved 
into the cellular texture ; the bones may be regarded as the 
cellular texture {la cellulosite) hardened by the accumulation 
of earthy substances. The general matter of which the cellular 
texture is composed is called gelatine ; it has the property of 
dissolving in boiling water, and, by cooling, it forms jelly. 

The cerebral or medullary matter has not yet been reduced 
to its organic molecules * ; it appears to the eye as a kind of 
soft pulp, in which we can only distinguish excessively minute 
globules. It does not seem susceptible of motion, but it is in 
this cerebral matter that resides the mysterious and admirable 
power of transmitting the impressions from the external senses 
to the mind, and of conveying to the muscles the orders of the 
will. The brain is principally composed of it; the spinal 
marrow, and the nerves which are distributed over the body, 
are, essentially, but bundles {faisceaux) or ramifications of the 
cerebral matter. 

The fleshy, or muscular fibre is a particular filament, the 
distinctive character of which, in a living state, is to contract 
when touched or struck by another body, or when it expe- 
riences, by the intervention of the nerves, the action of the 
will. 

The muscles, which are the immediate organs of voluntary 
motion, are only bundles of fleshy fibres ; all the membranes 
and vessels which exert a compressive force, are furnished 
with these fibres ; they are always intimately connected with 
nervous filaments. The substance of the fleshy fibre isjihrinej 
which is indissoluble in boiling water, and its nature appears 
to be, to take of itself the fibrous form. 

The nourishing fluid, or the blood, as it exists in the circu- 
lating vessels, may not only be resolved into the general ele- 
ments of the animal body, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and 
azote, but it already contains fibrine and gelatine, nearly pre- 
pared to contract and take the form of membranes or fibres ; 
at least, it only requires a little rest, to manifest these proper- 
ties. Another combination, called albumen, is easily discovered 
in the blood; its characteristic property is, to coagulate in 

* Since the publication of Cuvier's work several important discoveries 
have been made in the structure of the brain and nerves, by Spurzheim, 
Bell, Edwards, and others, from which it would appear that the structure 
of the medullary matter and nerves is fibrous, and, acconiing to Dr. Ed- 
wards, the fibres are composed of minute globules, like the cellular and 
muscular tissues. It appears, also, that the nerves which convey impres- 
sions to the mind, are distinct from those which convey the orders ol the 
will to the muscles. 



Cuvierian System of Zoology. 315 

boiling water. Albumen contains nearly all the elements 
which can enter into the composition of each animal, as lime 
and phosphorus, which harden the bones of vertebrated ani- 
mals, the iron which colours the blood, the fat and animal oil 
which are disposed in the cellular texture to soften it, &c. All 
the hquids and solids of the animal body are composed of 
chemical elements contained in the blood ; and it is only by 
abstracting some of these elements, or by varying the propor- 
tions, that they differ from each other ; in a few instances, an 
addition is made of some other element. These operations, 
by which the blood supports the solid parts of the body, are 
called nutrition ; the production of the liquids is generally 
called secretion. The blood which nourishes the body, is 
continually changing its properties ; but it is restored by diges- 
tion, which furnishes new matter ; and by respiration, which 
discharges the superfluous carbon and hydrogen ; while trans- 
piration, and various excretions, carry away other superabun- 
dant principles. 

The perpetual transformations of chemical composition 
constitute a condition of vital action, not less essential than the 
circulation and the internal motions of the parts ; indeed, the 
latter only serve to effect these transformations. 

The muscular fibre is the organ of animal motions, both of 
those which follow the action of the will, and those which are 
independent of volition, as the peristaltic motion of the intes- 
tines, and the pulsation of the heart and arteries. The will 
causes the muscular fibre to contract, by the intermediate 
action of the nerves ; and, as all the muscular fibres which 
produce involuntary motions are also accompanied by nerves, 
it is therefore probable that it is the nerves which produce 
muscular contraction in the latter. 

In order to account for the action of the nerves upon the 
muscular fibres, Cuvier, with other physiologists, admits the 
existence of a nervous fluid, which is not, however, like the 
other fluids of the body, confined in tubes, vessels, or pores, 
but is imponderable, like heat and electricity, though he sup- 
poses it to be secreted by the medullary matter. According to 
our author, the medullary matter of the brain and nerves is a 
conductor of the nervous fluid ; all the other organic elements 
are non-conductors, and arrest its progress, in the same man- 
ner as glass is a non-conductor of electricity. 

Every contraction, and, in general, every change of dimen- 
sion in nature, is effected (s'opere) by a change of chemical 
composition : sometimes, this is nothing more than the afflux 
or retreat of an imponderable fluid, such as caloric ; by this 
the most violent motions known on the earth are produced, as 



316 Cuvtej'ian Sj/stem of Zoology. 

combustions, detonations, &c. Hence, Cuvier infers that it 
is by an imponderable fluid that the nerve acts on the muscu- 
lar fibre, since it can be demonstrated, that it does not act 
mechanically. All the external causes that excite sensations, 
or occasion a contraction of the muscular fibre, are chemical 
agents, capable of effecting chemical decompositions, as light, 
caloric, salts, odorous vapours, percussion, compression, &c. : 
it is therefore probable, he says, that these causes act on the 
nervous fluid chemically, and change its composition ; for their 
action is weakened (s'emousse) by continuance, as if the ner- 
vous fluid required to be restored to its primitive state {compo- 
sition)^ in order to be acted upon again. The internal agents 
which irritate the muscular fibre, and occasion it to contract, 
probably produce the same effect upon it by the intervention 
of the nerves, as is caused by the will. The nervous fluid is 
changed {fait ere) by muscular irritation, as well as by sens- 
ation and voluntary motion, and has the same need to have its 
composition restored. The most important involuntary mo- 
tions are the peristaltic, or wormlike motion of the intestines, 
which is excited by the irritation of the aliments, and the 
pulsation of the heart and arteries, which is excited by the ir- 
ritation of the blood. . 

The external organs of the senses are a kind of sieves 
{crihles) that only admit those agents to the nerves, which 
ought to affect them in each place. Thus the tongue has 
strong papillae, which imbibe saline solutions; the ear has a 
gelatinous pulp, which is agitated by sonorous vibrations ; and 
the eye has transparent lenses, that are only permeable by 
light. I forbear to follow our author farther in his details 
of the action of the nervous fluid ; for the existence of such a 
Jliiid may be regarded as hypothetical : the nervous fluid may, 
however, be admitted as a term, to express the cause of ner- 
vous action, though we remain profoundly ignorant of the 
essence of this cause ; the same may be said of the essence of 
the electric fluid, of caloric, and of light ; and it may not be 
improper to remark, that there are some striking analogies 
between the nervous action, and electric or galvanic energy, 
which might induce us to believe that they are modifications 
of the same principle. Whatever explanation chemical or 
electric agency may afford, respecting the motions of the 
nerves or muscles, they entirely fail, when applied to sensation 
itself. Cuvier justly observes that the impression of external 
objects on the mind or individual consciousness {le fuoi), the 
production of a sensation or image, is an iuipenetrablc mystery 
to the human understimding; and materialism is so far from 
offering any solution, that pliiloso]>hy cannot furnish us with 



Cuvierian Si/stem of%oology. 317 

any direct proof of the actual existence of matter. We are, 
however, compelled, by an invariable law of the understanding, 
to refer the objects which excite our sensations to something 
out of the mind, existing in time or space, to which we give 
the name of matter, and the naturalist is bound to examine 
what appear to be the material con(litio7is of sensation. 

In order that external objects may be perceived, it is neces- 
sary that there should be an uninterrupted nervous communi- 
cation between the organs of sense, and the central masses of 
the medullary system ; for it is only the modifications of these 
masses that are perceived by the mind. 

There may be real sensations, without any impression on 
the external organs of sense ; these internal sensations originate 
either in the nerves, or the central medullary mass or brain ; 
such are dreams, visions, and certain accidental sensations. 
By central masses is to be understood, a part of the nervous 
system, which is more circumscribed in the more perfect ani- 
mals ; in man it is exclusively confined to a certain portion of 
the brain, but in reptiles it consists of the brain, and all the 
medullary matter of each part, taken separately, so that the 
absence of the whole brain does not destroy sensation; in the 
lower classes of animals, the medullary mass is far more ex- 
tended through the parts. 

The intellectual faculties possessed in a certain degree by 
the superior animals are, perception, memory, the association 
of ideas, imagination, volition, and reasoning. Our author 
enumerates also the power of abstraction, but it may be doubted 
whether abstraction can be effected without the aid of si^ns or 
lanffuaffe. 

One privileged being, man, has the faculty of associating 
general ideas with particular images, more or less arbitrarj^, 
which are easily fixed in the memory, and which serve him to 
recal the general ideas that they represent. These associated 
images are what are called signs ; collectively they form a 
language. When language is composed of signs relative to 
the sense of hearing, it is called speech. When the signs 
relate to objects of sight, they are called hieroglyphics. Writ- 
ing is a succession of images relative to the sense of sight, by 
which we represent the elementary sounds ; and, in combining 
them, we represent all the images relative to the sense of hear- 
ing, of which speech is composed. Writing is, therefore, only 
the mediate representation of ideas. 

This faculty of representing general ideas, by signs or 
images that we associate with them, assists to keep them dis- 
tinctly in the memory, and to recal an immense series of them 
without confusion ; and furnishes to the reason and the imagin-' 



318 Cuvieriaii System of Zoology. 

ation innumerable materials, and to individuals the means of 
communication, which make all the species participate in the 
experience of each individual ; so that knowledge may be in- 
creased indefinitely through the lapse of future ages. This is 
the distinctive character of the human understanding. 

The most perfect animals are infinitely below man in their 
intellectual faculties; it is, nevertheless, certain that their 
understanding leads them to perform actions of the same kind. 
They move in consequence of the sensations they receive; 
they are susceptible of durable affections ; they acquire a cer- 
tain knowledge of things by experience, according to which 
they conduct themselves, independently of actual pain and 
pleasure, by the sole foresight of consequences. In a domestic 
state, they feel their subordination, and know that the being 
who punishes them is free to do so or not ; they assume a 
supplicating air when they feel themselves culpable, or perceive 
that their master is angry. They improve or deteriorate in 
the society of man ; they are susceptible of emulation and jea- 
lousy ; they have among themselves a natural language, which 
is, indeed, only the expression of their present sensations, but 
man teaches them a much more complicated language, by 
which he makes them know his will, and compels them to 
execute it. 

We perceive, indeed, in the superior animals, a certain 
degree of reasoning, with all its effects, good or bad, which 
appears to be nearly the same as that of infants before they 
have learned to speak. In proportion as we descend to 
animals more removed from man, the intellectual faculties 
become weaker ; and, in the last classes, they finish, by being 
reduced to signs of sensibility, which are sometimes equivocal, 
that is, to certain feeble motions to escape pain. The degrees 
between the two extremes are infinite. But there exists, in a 
great number of animals, a faculty different from intelligence, 
called instinct. This makes them perform certain actions, 
necessary to the preservation of the species, but often alto- 
gether foreign to the apparent wants of the individual ; and 
often, also, extremely complicated. We cannot attribute these 
actions to intelligence, without supposing a degree of foresight 
and understanding infinitely superior to what we can admit in 
the species that perform them. The actions performed by 
instinct are not the effects of imitation, for the individuals that 
execute them have often never seen them done by others ; they 
bear no proportion to the common intelligence of the species, 
but become more singular, more skilful, more disinterested, in 
proportion as the animals belong to the less elevated classes, 
and are, in other respects, most stupid. They are so much the 



Cuvierian System of Zoology, - 319 

property of the species, that all the individuals perform them 
in the same manner, without any improvement. 

Thus working bees have, since the beginning of the world, 
constructed the most ingenious edifices, agreeable to princi- 
ples of the highest geometry, and destined to lodge and nourish 
a posterity which is not even their own. Sohtary bees and 
wasps form also very complicated nests for their eggs. From 
the egg there springs out a worm, which has never seen its 
mother, which does not know the structure of the prison in 
which it is enclosed, but when once it is changed into a wasp or 
bee, it constructs a similar nest, equally perfect, for its own 
egg. 

" We cannot," says Cuvier, " form a clear idea of instinct, 
but by admitting that the animals endowed with it have, in the 
sensorium, continued innate sensations and images, which deter- 
mine them to act, like sensations received through the external 
organs of sense. Instinct is a kind of dream, or vision, that 
perpetually haunts them, and prompts them to action, and in 
every thing that respects their instinctive motions, we may re- 
gard animals as a kind of somnambulists. Instinct has been 
granted to animals as a supplement to intelligence, to concur, 
together with their strength and fecundity, in the preservation 
of each species, in their due proportions. There are no visible 
marks of instinct in the animal conformation ; but intelligence, 
as far as we can observe, is in a constant proportion to the 
relative size of the brain, and particularly to that of its two 
hemispheres." 

The following remarks of Dr. Hartley, on the intellectual 
faculties of brutes, are extremely judicious, and so much to the 
purpose of the present essa}^, that I shall subjoin them : — 
" The whole nature of each brute which has been brought 
up among others of the same species, is a compound of instinct, 
its own observation and experience, and imitation of those of 
its own species. Instinct seems to have exerted its whole in- 
fluence when the creature is arrived at maturity, and has 
brought up its young, so that nothing new can be expected 
from it (instinct) afterwards. But the intellectual acquisitions 
of brutes, from observation and experience, continue ; whence 
old brutes are far more cunning, and can act better {pro re nata) 
as circumstances arise, than young ones. It ought also to be 
remembered that brutes, from their want of words, and from 
our ignorance of those symbols which they use in giving inti- 
mations to each other or to man, cannot make manifest to us 
the extent of the reason they possess." ( Observations on Man, 
vol. i. p. 414..) B.

Art. III. On the Aerial Spider. By John Murray, Esq. F.S.Al

Sir, 
I FEEL gratified by the favourable review of my Experimen- 
tal Researches in Natural Historic (published by Georo-e B. 
Whittaker, Ave Maria Lane), in your Second Number. As 
far as I know, I have not ventured beyond the pale of sound 
and sober reasoning, in the true spirit of inductive science. 

I have not presumed any thing in the shape of an opinion 
on the origin of light. It issues from a cloud which conceals 
its source. I have not attempted to penetrate its depth and 
labyrinth. I may, however, be permitted to add that Canton's 
phosphorus is merely composed of calcined shells, which a high 
temperature illuminates. There is a considerable brilliance 
excited, when the electric discharge is passed through this 
substance, and I have found the following a very pretty expe- 
riment : — Having strewn Canton's phosphorus (as it is called) 
over the surface of mercury contained in a shallow basin, I 
immerse into the fluid metal one of the wires of an extensive 
galvanic battery, and bring the other polar wire in contact 
with its surface ; at this moment the calcined particles become 
beautifully luminous, and continue to glow for some time after 
the positive and negative wires have been withdrawn. The 
nature of the subject treated of in my little volume, necessarily 
precluded a more full view of the nature and laws of light, and 
its multifarious sources, and what I have introduced can be 
only considered a very partial and superficial glance, as prefa- 
tory to the topic treated of, namely " the light and luminous 
matter of the glowworm." 

The object of this communication must, however, be chiefly 
confined to the ascent and flight of the aerial spider. 

Mr. Black wall's observations {Lin. Trails., vol. xv. part ii. 
p. 449. etseq.) on this curious question are cited, in opposition 
to my numerous and varied experiments ; but I cannot admit 
that they possess much consequence or force. It does not 
appear that this author had seen an account of my experi- 
mental researches on the ascent of the little aeronaut ; other- 
wise, he might have hesitated in committing himself to the 
Linnean Society, in the view he has endeavoured to sustain, 
but which, however, I believe is not new. 

M. Gay Lussac having found that soap bubbles would 
not ascend in a room, though their ascent is rapid in the open 
air, unhesitatingly ascribes their ascent to warm currents ema- 
nating from the surface of the ground ; rooted in this opinion, 



On the Aerial Spider. 321 

Mr. Blackwall concludes that the flight of the spider originates 
in a similar cause. 

Contrary to the assertion, that " spiders have no power of 
propelling their webs without assistance from the wind," I 
fearlessly maintain that they can do so in an atmosphere in 
which the very leaf of the aspen remains motionless; and 
although their char volant obeys the direction of the breeze, this 
simple fact proves nothing in favour of the opinion advanced 
by Mr. Blackwall. The aeronautic spider can propel its 
threads both horizontally and vertically, and at all relative 
angles, in motionless air, and in an atmosphere agitated by 
winds ; nay more, the aerial traveller can even dart its thread, 
to use a nautical phrase, in the " wind's eye." My opinion 
and observations are based on many hundreds of experiments ; 
on favourable occasions I am constantly extending their 
amount; and as often do I find my deductions supported, 
namely, that the entire phenomena are electrical. My infer- 
ences, therefore, have not been hastily drawn. 

When a thread is propelled in the vertical plane, it remains 
perpendicular to the horizontal plane, always upright,' and 
when others are projected at angles more or less inclined, their 
direction is invariably preserved ; the threads never intermingle, 
and when a pencil of threads is propelled, it ever presents the 
appearance of a divergent brush. These are electrical pheno- 
mena, and cannot be explained except on electrical principles. 

The specific gravity of the insect, with its web, are very 
superior to that of the atmosphere, and without some exotic 
power imparted to them, their rise in the atmosphere would be 
impracticable ; and though a film inflated with heated, and of 
course, rarefied air, would certainly ascend, it is more difficult 
to undersand how a solitary thread, so fine, could be thus 
acted upon by any current of air, whether heated or not, so as 
to determine its buoyancy and ascent. And so far from the 
unattached cobwebs, which are occasionally seen to float in 
the atmosphere, having been " raised from the surface of the 
ground, by the action of air highly rarefied by a cloudless sun," 
such threads will be seen to fall in the warmest weather, and in 
all the unclouded radiance of the sunbeam. But this phenome- 
non presages rain, and is its precursor. The electrical character 
of the atmosphere has changed from positive to negative. 

These interesting aeronauts sometimes rise with the rapidity 
of an arrow in the zenith of the observer ; at other times, they 
are seen to float parallel with the plane of the horizon ; and 
again, at variously inclined angles. Sometimes the ascent is 
extremely slow. An ascending current of warm air, it is con- 
ceivable, might effect a vertical movement; but how it could push 

Vol. I. — No. 4. z 



S22i On iJie Aerial Spider, 

the insect along in the horizontal plane, is an enigma of more 
didicult solution. 

I do not understand what Mr. Blackwall means, in what he 
says about the electricity of the atmosphere. I take it for 
granted, that it is seldom or never in a neutral state, with re- 
spect to electricity, being either positively or negatively electri- 
cal ; in which view I am warranted, not merely by my own 
experiments, but of those conversant with atmospherical elec- 
tricity. In clear fine weather, the air is invariably positive ; 
and it is precisely in such weather that the aeronautic spider 
makes its ascent most easily and rapidly, whether it be sum- 
mer or winter ; I have often seen this in winter, during an in- 
tense frost, a circumstance which renders the action of warm 
currents of air, as accessory to its flight, something more than 
questionable. Our aeronaut may be met with in its descent 
over the Mer de Glace, as well as over the Lake of Geneva; and 
it will take flight as readily from a point over the Frozen Sea, 
as from the heated surface soil of the Valley of Chamouny. I 
am not yet convinced that there are calorific emanations from 
the Glacier de Bois. 

When the air is weakly positive, the ascent of the spider will 
be difficult, and its altitude extremely limited, and the threads 
propelled will be but little elevated above the horizontal plane. 
When negative electricity prevails, as in cloudy weather, or 
on the approach of rain, with a falling barometer, and the in- 
dex of De Saussure's hygrometer rapidly advancing towards 
humidite^ the spider is unable to ascend. Towards evening 
the positive electricity of the air becomes feeble, and during 
night changes to negative ; and at these periods the aeronauts 
descend from their skyey elevation to the earth. I have al- 
ready clearly proved, experimentally, that the thread is imbued 
with negative electricity : and such a thread, darted through 
the air with force and velocity, must of necessity become elec- 
trified, as a consequence of the friction it must suffer from the 
resisting medium it permeates. Such a thread, with its attach- 
ment, must ascend, until it is neutralised by its equivaletit of 
positive electricity. These insects descend in vast numbers 
during the night to imbibe the dew, which condenses on the 
webs they w^eave among the grass ; the attachment of globules 
of dew to the tips of the blades of grass, seems an electrical 
phenomenon, and as the thread must be considered a non- 
conductor of caloric, the fact of its being bedewed seems most 
easily referable to electricity. 

I caught one of these aeronautic spiders a few days ago, the 
folding glass doors of the library room leading into the gar- 
den were open, and the insect being conveniently arranged, it 



Oti the Aerial Spider 323 

darted fortti, from within the room, a lengthened thread diago- 
nally upwards, and thus effected its ascent ; a fact at complete 
antipodes with Mr. Blackwall's opinion. 

The number of the aeronautic spiders occasionally suspended 
in the atmosphere, I believe to be almost incredible, could we 
ascertain their amount. I was walking with a friend on the 
9th, and noticed that there were four of these insects on his 
hat, at the moment there were three on my own ; and from the 
rapidity with which they covered its surface with their threads, 
I cannot doubt that they are chiefly concerned in the produc- 
tion of that tissue which intercepts the dew, and which, illu- 
minated by the morning sun, " glitters with gold,' and with 
rubies and sapphires." Indeed, I have noticed that, when the 
frequent descent of the aeronautic spider was determined, a 
newly rolled turnip field was, in a few hours, overspread by a 
carpet of their threads. It may be remarked that our little 
aeronaut is very greedy of moisture, though abstemious in 
other respects. Its food is perhaps peculiar, and only found 
in the superior regions of the sky. Like the rest of its tribe, 
it is doubtless carnivorous, and may subserve some highly 
important purpose in the economy of Providence ; such, for 
instance, as the destruction of that truly formidable, though 
almost microscopically minute insect, the Furia infernalis, 
whose wound is stated to be mortal. Its existence has been 
indeed questioned, but by no means disproved ; that, and some 
others, injurious to man, or to the inferior creation, may be its 
destined prey, and thus our little aeronaut, unheeded by the 
common eye, may subserve an important good. 

As connected with this question, I may mention that the 
electrical strata of the atmosphere, on Sunday the 6th inst., 
was singularly illustrated in the curious configurations of the 
dust on the pavement, being exhibited in a plumose form, 
resembling the figures described on a plate of rosin when 
touched by an electrified substance, and powdered rosin or 
sulphur, &c., is projected against them : an experiment we 
owe to Professor Lightenberg ; while, I believe, the late Dr. 
Millar, of Edinburgh, was the first to notice these very inte- 
resting arborescent forms of dust, and refer the phenomenon 
to electricity. I noticed, also, on that day, that these confi-i 
gurations had their feathery image and impress in the sky, 
several of the clouds presenting that plumose form. 

I now beg to quote an extract from a communication on 
the subject of the gossamer spider, made to me by my friend, 
J. E. Bowman, Esq. F.L.S. ; and I shall at present content 
myself with it, not wishing to anticipate what may elsewhere 
appear on this subject. " We arrested several of these little

aeronauts in their flight, and placed them on the brass gno- 
mon of the sundial, and had the gratification to see them 
prepare for, and recommence, their aerial voyage. Having 
crawled about for a short time, to reconnoitre, they turned 
their abdomens from the current of air, and elevated them 
almost perpendicularly, supporting themselves solely on the 
claws of their fore legs, at the same instant shooting out four 
or five, often six or eight, extremely fine webs, several yards 
long, which waved in the breeze, diverging from each other 
like a pencil of rays, and strongly reflecting the sunbeams. 
After the insects had remained stationary in this apparently 
unnatural position for about half a minute, they sprang off* from 
the stage with considerable agility, and launched themselves 
into the air. In a few seconds after they were seen sailing 
majestically along, without any apparent effort, their legs 
contracted together, and lying perfectly quiet on their backs, 
suspended from their silken parachutes, and presenting to 
the lover of nature a far more 
interesting spectacle than the 
balloon of the philosopher. 
One of these natural aeronauts 
I followed, which, sailing in 
the sunbeams, had two dis- 
tinct and widely diverging 
fasciculi of webs, as in the 
annexed sketch (y^. 161.); 
and their position in the air 
was such, that a line uniting them would have been at right 
angles with the direction of the breeze." 

In conclusion, permit me to mention, in reference to the 
glowworm, that I was quite aware of the opinion that had been 
entertained respecting the light of the glowworms, and reite- 
rated by my reviewer ; and the reason why I did not mention it 
was, that I held it to be unsatisfactory ; my reasons are, that 
the insect, in its imperfect form of the larva, is gifted with 
light, as well as in its perfect and ultimate stage of metamor- 
phosis. The winged male, as in the iyampyris italica, carries 
its torch as well as the apterous female. Superadd to these, 
that the inference would not apply to the case of the crawling 
jScolopendra electrica on the one hand, or the winged Ful- 
gura lanternaria on the other,

Monster of the Sheep Ge?im, 325 

Art. IV. Account of a monstrous Production of the Sheep Genus. 
By John Chichester, Esq. M.D. 

Sir, 

In the course of the spring of 1827, I was requested by 
Mr. Averill, a surgeon of distinction, settled in this place, and 
well known to the profession by his treatise on operative sur- 
ger}^, to assist him in the examination of a monstrous produc- 
tion of the sheep genus (O'vis Li7i.). We were aware that, 
by the means of injection, we should be most likely to discover 
such facts as might be brought to bear upon the science of 
organisation; but, besides some other unfavourable circum- 
stances, putrefaction had too far advanced to admit of its being 
minutely executed ; in which way only, perhaps, can the inves- 
tigation of the law which governs those anomalies be success- 
fully conducted. 

The great difference in the opinions which prevail at pre- 
sent respecting monsters, comes, in all probability, from an 
insufficiency of facts, or, rather, from an imperfect detail of 
them ; since the greater part of the many cases to be found in 
books, scarcely furnishes one probable induction, so loosely and 
indistinctly are they stated. Their philosophical history is 
still in its cradle. 

The strange and irregular production of nature which at 
present engages our attention, had only one head, which was 
of the natural size, and complete in all its parts. It cannot be 
regarded as being acephalous, in respect to one of the two 
bodies, for the head was equally in common to both. 

There was one atlas only, of regular form, but somewhat 
larger than natural. This circumstance, together with one 
complete head, without the least rudimentary trace of a second, 
is sufficient to exclude all idea of absorption having played any 
part in this monstrous production ; while, on the other hand, 
it favours very strongly the opinion of Blumenbach, Meckel, 
and Geoffroy St. Hilaire, who lay it down as an axiom, that 
all monstrosities (called by the latter les anojualies connees)ave 
the result of interrupted developement. 

The second vertebra was single at the upper part, with only 
two articular surfaces, and of a size corresponding with the 
bone above it ; below it was double, and, consequently, had a 
breadth somewhat out of proportion to its superior part. 
Hence went off two distinct vertebral columns, both con- 
taining the usual number of vertebrae in each division, and 
each of them seemed perfect, to the very caudal extremities. 
We found the whole of the other bones complete in number, 
as well as form, throughout both skeletons. . , 

z 3 



326 Monster of the Sheep Geniis, 

The ribs of the right side of one animal were connected with 
those of the left side of the other, by a regularly formed ster- 
num ; while those of the opposite side, i. e. the left of one 
animal, and the right of the other, formed nearly a horizontal 
plane, and were connected by a second sternum, turned the 
reverse way of the other. The right scapula of the left animal, 
and the left scapula of the right animal, lay superiorly, while 
the corresporfding scapulae were situated immediately beneath, 
supporting the fore part of the common trunk. It does not 
seem that any thing further remains to be said respecting the 
bony parts ; which, by the joint aid of Messrs. Averill and 
Charles Fowler, have been formed into a natural skeleton of 
great beauty, and deposited in the museum attached to the 
Casualty Hospital of this town. 

In respect to the soft parts, there was only one oesophagus, 
which was natural, and passed down, between the two vertebral 
columns, to the stomach, through a diaphragm which sepa- 
rated one thoracic and one abdominal cavity in common to the 
two animals. 

The stomach was single, and of the same regular, though 
complex, structure, that it is found to be of in all ruminating 
animals. The four divisions were distinct, and, in every re- 
spect, quite^natural. 

From the pyloric extremity of the stomach, passed off a set 
of small intestines, which were in common to the two bodies ; 
the last of them terminated somewhat on the right side of the 
centre of an arch, which had the distinguishing characters of a 
colon ; this passed down on each side to something resembling 
a sigmoid flexure, and then, from the base of each sacrum, 
descended, through each pelvis, a rectum, terminating in its 
own external opening. No trace of a caecum could be found. 

There was a liver, rather larger than natural, lying under 
the right ribs of the left body; and beneath the right ribs of 
the right body, near the inferior sternum, was discovered 
another, about half the size of the former. Each had a distinct 
set of vessels, but we could only detect one gall-bladder. The 
circumstance of there being two livers in this case, with only 
one heart, as will be seen hereafter, very much increases the 
anomaly ; for it is laid down by a systematic writer, that " avec 
le coeur manque constamment le foie." We could only find 
one pancreas and one spleen. 

The kidneys were double, and so were the whole pelvic 

viscera. The animals were both males, and the genital organs 

appeared to be natural. It has been asserted by Pohle, Pal- 

^fyn, and others, that the greater number of monsters are of 

the female sex ; but, as far as my observation has been extended. 



Monstef'of the S/ieep Genus. 327 

the fact has turned out differently, the much greater number 
having been males. In both cases, I am inclined to suppose it 
merely a matter of chance ; and that, upon a large scale of 
investigation, the numbers would be found nearly equal. That, 
however, which occurred to the above-mentioned authors was 
easily seized upon to support their own hypothesis, — that, in 
the female, the plastic, or moulding, force is less powerful 
than in the male. It is, I believe, also generally admitted, 
that, in acephalous monsters, the viscera of the abdomen and 
pelvis are found more or less rudimentary only, particularly 
the urinary and genital organs ; but, in the case before us, the 
genital organs, as well as all the other pelvic viscera, were 
completely formed. 

There was only one trachea, which descended into a tho- 
racic cavity in common to the two animals. This cavity con- 
tained only one set of lungs, one division of them lying against 
the ribs of the right side of the one animal ; the other division, 
against the left ribs of the other. There existed no mediastinum. 

Only one heart could be found, which was of the natural size 
and structure : but from each ventricle sprung an aorta ; of 
these two vessels, one turned to the right, the other to the 
left. The one which turned to the left, went down in the na- 
tural direction ; while that which turned to the right, crossed 
the right vertebral column, and passed down on the outer side 
of it. A transverse vessel, of somewhat smaller caliber, passed 
from the beginning of the turn of the arch on one side, to the 
same part on the other side, thus forming a communication 
between the two aortas. The circumstance of there being 
only one heart, and that of the natural size only, while the two 
animals appear, with the exceptions that have been stated, to 
have experienced no interruption in their intra-uterine growth, 
seems to make it doubtful whether, according to M. Serres, 
the sanguiferous system is to be considered as regulating and 
forming all the others. It is held also, by many other physio- 
logists besides M, Serres, that the strength and volume of all 
the organs are in dii'ect proportion to the quantity of blood 
bestowed upon them. 

Such are the striking circumstances that presented themselves 
to my observation. I am not aware that any description of 
a similar monstrosity is to be found in books, or that any such 
is contemplated by GeofFroy St. Hilaire, or any other syste- 
matic writer. I remain. Sir, &c.

328 Maimers of the NuthatcJu 

Art. V. On the Manners of the Nuthatch, By H. S. With a 
Note by W. Swainson, F.R.S. &c. 

I HAD never seen the little bird called the Nuthatch (5itta 
europae^a) {Jig, 162.), when, one day, as I was expecting the 
transit of some wood-pigeons under i62 

a beech tree, with a gun in my hand, 
I observed a little ash-coloured 
bird squat himself on one of the 
large lateral trunks over my head, 
and, after some observation, begin( 
to tap loudly, or rather solidly upon^ 
the wood, and then proceed round and round the branch, it being 
clearly the same thing to him whether his nadir or zenith were 
uppermost. I shot, and the bird fell : there was a lofty hedge 
between us, and when I had got over he had removed him- 
self^ It was some time before I secured him, and I mention 
this, because the manner in which he eluded me was charac- 
teristic of his cunning. He concealed himself in holes at the 
bottom of a ditch, so long as he heard the noise of motion, 
and, when all was still, he would scud out and attempt to 
escape. A wing was broken, and I at length got hold of him. 
He proved small, but very fierce, and his bite would have 
made a child cry out. The elbow joint of the wing being 
thoroughly shattered, and finding that he had no other wound, 
I cut off the dangling limb, and put him into a large cage 
with a common lark. The wound did not in the least dimi- 
nish his activity, nor yet his pugnacity, for he instantly began 
to investigate all possible means of escape ; he tried the bars ; 
then tapped the woodwork of the cage, and produced a knock- 
ing sound, which made the room reecho ; but, finding his 
efforts vain, he then turned upon the lark, ran under him with 
his gaping beak to bite, and effectually alarmed his far more 
gentle and elegant antagonist. Compelled to separate them, 
the nuthatch, for this bird I discovered him to be by turning 
over the leaves of an Ornithologia^ was put into a smaller cage 
of plain oak wood and wire. Here he remained all night; and, 
the next morning, his knocking or tapping with his beak was 
the first sound I heard, though sleeping in an apartment 
divided from the other by a landing-})lace. He had food 
given to him, minced chicken and bread crumbs, and water. 
He eat and drank with a most perfect impudence, and the 
moment he had satisfied himself turned again to his work of 
battering the frame of his cage, the sound from which, both 
in loudness and prolongation of noise, is only to be compared 
to the ellurts of a fashionable footman upon a fashionable 



Marnier s of the Nuthatch, 329 

door in a fashionable square. He had a particular fancy for 
the extremities of the corner pillars of the cage; on these 
he spent his most elaborate taps, and at this moment, though 
he only occupied the cage a day, the wood is pierced and 
worn like a piece of old wormeaten timber. He probably 
had an idea, that if these main beams could once be pene- 
trated, the rest of the superstructure would fall and free him. 
Against the doorway he had also a particular spite, and 
once succeeded in opening it; and when, to interpose a far- 
ther obstacle, it was tied in a double knot, with string, the 
perpetual application of his beak quickly unloosed it. In 
ordinary cages a circular hole is left in the wire for the bird 
to insert his head, to drink from a glass : to this hole the 
nuthatch constantly repaired, not for the purpose of drinking, 
but to try to push out inore than his head, but in vain ; for 
he is a thick bird, and rather heavily built ; but the instant he 
found the hole too small he would withdraw his head, and 
begin to dig and hammer at the circle, and where it is rooted 
in the wood, with his pickaxe of a beak, evidently with a 
design to enlarge the orifice. His labour was incessant, and 
he eat as largely as he worked ; and I fear it was the united 
effects of both that killed him. His hammering was peculiarly 
laborious, for he did not peck as other birds do, but, grasp- 
ing his hold with his immense feet, he turned upon them as 
upon a pivot, and struck with the whole weight of his bod}^, 
thus assuming the appearance, with his entire form, of the 
head of a hammer, or, as I have sometimes seen birds on me- 
chanical clocks made to strike the hour by swinging on a 
wheel. We were in hopes that when the sun went down he 
would cease from his labours, and rest : but, no ; at the interval 
of every ten minutes, up to nine or ten o'clock in the night, 
he resumed his knocking; and strongly reminded us of the 
coffinmaker's nightly and dreary occupation. It was said by 
one of us, " he is nailing his own coffin ;" and so it proved. 
An awful fluttering in the cage, now covered with a handker- 
chief, announced that something was wrong : we found him at 
the bottom of his prison, with his feathers ruffled, and nearly 
all turned back. He was taken out, and for some time he 
lingered amidst convulsions, and occasional brightenings up ; 
at length he drew his last gasp ; and will it be believed that 
tears were shed on his demise ? The fact is, that the appa- 
rent intelligence of his character, the speculation in his eye, 
the assiduity of his labour, and his most extraordinary fear- 
lessness and familiarity, though coupled with fierceness, gave 
us a consideration for him that may appear ridiculous to those 



330 Maimers of the Nuthatch, 

who have never so nearly observed the ways of an animal as 
to feel interested in its fate. With us it was different. 

Since our poor nuthatch died, I have observed that 
White, in his charming work on the Natural Histoiy of 
Selborne, states that the knocking of the nuthatch may be 
heard at the distance of a furlong ; and that he has frequently 
placed nuts in the joints of a gate for this bird, which were 
quickly penetrated by his beak, and the kernel extracted. 
The beak is uncommonly large and strong for so small a bird. 
I have requested my friend Mr. Swainson to add a short scien- 
tific note to this memoir ; such matters not coming within my 
range. H. S. 

Note hy Mr, Swainson, — After this animated sketch from 
nature (would that we had more of them ! ) scientific details will 
appear dry ; yet a few may not be misplaced. The great 
force with which, as my friend describes, this little bird 
laboured with its bill, led me to examine it minutely, and to 
compare it with several of the extra-European species ; but 
ih none of these is the bill of an equal size and proportionate 
strength. It may further be remarked, that, among the ASittae 
generally, the end of the bill is more depressed than com- 
pressed, while the tip is generally rounded : but in the Euro- 
pean nuthatch, this part, when viewed laterally {Jig, 163. a\ ex- 
hibits a good deal of that abrupt truncation so well adapted 
for breaking hard substances, which is seen in the woodpecker, 
the point of whose bill exactly resembles that of a wedge. The 
only foreign species I have seen, in which ^ 153 
any thing like this structure can be traced, 
is the Sitta carolinensis. The group evi- 
dently stands intermediate between the true 
Certhiadae and the Picidae of modern orni- 
thologists. To the latter it is assimilated 
by its perfectly straight and somewhat wedge-shaped bill, 
and by a corresponding economy of habit in procuring 
nourishment, already so well described. On the other hand, 
the feet of the >Sittae, although scansorial, are not of that 
peculiar construction which constitutes the typical perfection 
of climbing birds ; the toes, as in all the Certhiadas, being 
placed three forwards and one backwards. With this union 
of characters I am disposed to consider the *SittaB as a dis- 
tinct type or sub-family of Certhiadae, and that by which 
nature passes to the true woodpeckers, through the intervening 
forms of Oxyrhynchus and lunx. The tongue is not capable 
of extension ; it is bifid, with the divisions slightly ciliated 





Manners and Economy of the Pied Flycatcher, 331 

Art. VI. Manners and Economy of the Pied Flycatcher, By 
John Blackwall, Esq. 

Sir, 

In directing the attention of the ornithological readers of 
the Magazine of Natural History to a favourite haunt of the 
Pied Flycatcher (Muscicapa luctuosa TemmincJc) {fig, 164.), 
I am not without hope that ^^^^ i64 

some individual, who has lei- 
sure for the undertaking, may 
be stimulated to investigate 
the manners and economy of 
this interesting species, with a 
greater degree of minuteness 
than has hitherto been done. 
The elucidation of several 
doubtful points in its history could 
industry, and promote the interests of science. 

On the 3d of June last, I procured a male Pied Flycatcher 
in the woods near the ferry-house, on the western shore of 
Windermere, where I saw two males and a female. The fe- 
male and one of the males had paired, and were occupied in 
constructing a nest in a hole in a decayed pollard ash, on the 
margin of the lake. But the vicinity of Ullswater appears to 
be the most favoured resort of this species ; as in walking, on 
the 1st of June, from the Water-head to Gowbarrow Old 
Park, on the western side of the lake, a distance not exceed- 
ing three miles, I saw, without quitting the carriage road, five 
males at five separate stations, which were distinctly marked 
by large pollard ashes, partially decayed. To these spots the 
birds were evidently much attached, reluctantly retiring from 
them to a short distance when greatly disturbed, and imme- 
diately returning again when the cause of their alarm was 
removed. This circumstance led me to suppose that they had 
nests ; and as I did not observe a single female, it is probable 
that they were engaged in incubating their eggs, or in brood- 
ing their young. The males were all in full song, and their 
notes, which are sometimes, though rarely, delivered on the 
wing, are pleasing and varied. 

Ornithologists do not seem to be acquainted with the extent 
of the vocal powers possessed by this species. According to 
Dr. Latham {General History of Birds, vol. vi.), Mr. Bolton, 
the author of Ha^-mbnia Rurdlis, has remarked that the song 
of the male, which is heard in the breeding season, resembles 
that of the Spotted Flycatcher, but that it is more sprightly 
and energetic. The comparison is an unfortunate one, and 



^82 Instinct of Insects. 

may have induced a belief that the Pied Flycatcher has no 
song whatever, as the spotted species is one of our most silent 
birds. I am happy, therefore, in being able to claim for the 
Pied Flycatcher a place among British singing birds. 

Both Montagu and Latham have regarded the Pied Fly- 
catcher as indigenous to England ; but, in Lancashire, I have 
never seen this species earlier in the year than April, nor 
later than September. Its habits indicate a bird which preys 
principally on insects in their winged or perfect state, and, as 
such, there can be little doubt that it is migratory. A suffi- 
cient reason, however, why the fact has not been more clearly 
ascertained, will be found in its great rarity and partial distri- 
bution. 

I have long known that the Pied Flycatcher breeds annu- 
ally in the beautiful woods near Ullswater, but I was not 
aware, before the present summer, that it is to be found in 
such abundance in that delightful locality.

Art. VII. * On the Instinct of Insects, By J. H. Da vies, Esq. 

Sir, 
' It has been asserted that the circuitous flight of the butter- 
fly tribe arises from one sex pursuing through the air the 
track of the other ; and that, if an unimpregnated female of 
the Phalae^na g'uercus (egger moth) be carried in a gauze cage 
into the haunts of that species, numbers of the males will 
be attracted, so as to be easily captured. I have never had 
an opportunity of verifying this fact ; but, from a circumstance 
which occurred to me during the past year, I have no doubt 
of its correctness. 

I was engaged in rearing lepidopterous insects from the 
larvae, and had a great variety of the pupae of different species ; 
one evening I found a female Sphinx ocellata just emerged, 
which, in lifting from the floor, ran up my arm, and round 
the collar of my coat : two hours afterwards, on returning to 
my study from shutting some glass frames in the garden, a 
very fine male of the same species was fluttering on my 
shoulder, where the female had previously crawled. But a 
still more curious fact, which must appear almost incredible, 
remains to be stated. Two females of the Sphinx />6puli were 
developed ; the next day I found three males in the room. As 
no one had entered it in the interval, nor was there apparently 



Jussieuean, or Natural^ System of Plants'. 333. 

any mocle by which they could gain access, I was somewhat 
puzzled to account for their appearance. The same evening, 
however, their mode of entree was made apparent, by two 
more males of the same species coming dawn the chimney^ one 
of which fell into a vase standing in the fireplace where I 
captured it before it could extricate itself. Afterwards, on 
occasion of th^ evolution from the pupa state of females of 
the Phalae^na bucephala and P. salicis, ^the windows of rny 
study were completely besieged by males of the same species, 
which, on throwing open the windows, eagerly rushed in. 
The instinct which in these cases must have guided the little 
animals is truly wonderful.

Order XIII. FLACOURT/JW^J^. 
A VERY small order formerly comprised in Tiliaceae. It is 
remarkable on account of the structure of its fruit, to the 
inner lining of which the seeds are attached upon a branched 
placenta. Nothing is known of the properties of the fla- 
courtias. The berries of Flacourt2« Ramontchi are eaten in 
Madagascar. The order consists entirely of small tropical 
trees or bushes.

Order XIV. CAPPARFDEiE. 
These are nearly related to Cruciferae, of the properties of 
which they partake. Many are very pretty plants, especially 
Cleome r5sea, and the various species of CrataeV^r. The 
common caper is an elegant bush, remarkable for its large 
white flowers and long purple stamens. The species are 
found occasionally in various parts of the world. The dif- 
ferent kinds of Capparis are reputed to be stimulating, anti- 
scorbutic, and aperient. The bark of the root of the common 
caper passes for a diuretic medicine. Several species of 
Cle5me have an acrid taste, which has been compared by 
travellers to that of mustard. The root of Cleome dode- 
candra is employed as a vermifuge in the United States ; and 
the leaves produce an inflammation of the skin, whence they 
are used in Cochin-china as a sinapism. {Dec)

Order XV. HOLARIE'^. 

This is one of the most favourite orders with gardeners ; 
Consisting, as it chiefly does, of the Violetgenus, from which most 
of the others are recent dismemberments. The greater part 
consists of hardy herbaceous plants, some of which are remark- 
able for their perfume, others for their brilliant colours, and all 
for their neatness. They are natives of the temperate or cold 
zones of both hemispheres, often growing at great elevations 
above the sea. Among them is a tribe called Alsodineae, 
consisting of suffrutescent tropical plants ; but none of them 
have been introduced to the gardens of this country. The 
attention of collectors should be directed to procuring the 
shrubby Fiolaceae of Brazil, some of which possess great 
interest. The medical properties of the order are found 
principally in their roots, which appear to possess, in all 
cases, emetic properties, in a greater or less degree. One of 
the ipecacuanhas is the root of a Brazilian violet. M. Decan- 
dolle has the following observations upon the affinities of the 
^olarieae : — They are very nearly akin, he observes, to the 
Polygaleae and Droseraceae, and especially to the Passifloreae. 
From the first they are distinguished by their unilocular fruit, 
leaves furnished with stipules and two-celled anthers ; from 
Droseraceae by their solitary style, lengthened embryo and 
stipulate leaves, the vernation of which is involutive, not cir- 
cinate. From Passifloreae they differ in their fruit being 
capsular, not berried ; in their albumen being compact and 
shining, not pitted ; in their stamens being hypogynous, not 
perigynous ; in their anthers being attached along their whole 
length, not fixed by their middle ; finally, in their stigmas 
being one and not three. The genus Calyptrion approaches 
Passifloreae in its twining stem, and Hymenanthera borders 
upon Polygaleae on account of its monospermous pericarpium 
with solitary pendulous seeds.

Order XVI. POLYGAXE^. 

Most of the plants of this order are interesting, and de- 
serving the attention of the gardener, some for their neatness, 
some for their beauty, and some for their use in medicine. 
They are natives of most countries, and are either low herba- 
ceous plants, occasionally less than an inch in height (small 
specimens of Polygala purpurea), or shrubs varying froni a 
dwarf, rigid, spiny habit, to a tall, graceful, drooping appear- 
ance. Polygaleae are remarkable for the union of their 
stamens into a single body, their one-celled anthers opening 



thissieuean, or Natural^ System of Plants, 335 

with a pore, and their irregular flowers, one of which is often 
keel-shaped, and beautifully crested or bearded. The leaves 
have generally a bitter astringent taste, which is much more 
abundant in the roots, combined with an acrid and somewhat 
resinous flavour : these properties are particularly sensible in 
P. Senega, which is reputed a sudorific, diuretic, sialagogue, 
cathartic, or mild emetic, according to the manner in which it 
is administered. The yelhoi of South America, the root of a 
species of Monnina, has the same properties as P. Senega, and 
is particularly used as a remedy for dysentery. The well 
known rattany, or ratanhia, root of Chile, is the produce of 
a plant of this order, and possesses powerful tonic and astrin- 
gent qualities. According to the analysis of a French che- 
mist, it contains gallic acid, but neither tannin nor resin.

Order XVII. DROSERA^CE.E. 
The order of sun-dews is a small group of plants, natives 
of marshes or inundated grounds in all the temperate parts of 
the world. The species are very remarkable for the abun- 
dance of glandular hairs with which all the parts of the foliage 
are covered. Only two species are in any degree frutescent. 
The young leaves are always rolled up in the circinate man- 
ner, so remarkable in ferns. Their medicinal properties ap- 
pear to be trifling : the leaves have the power of curdling milk.

Order XVIII. BIXI'NEM, 

The plants of this order are few in number, and not re- 
markable either for beauty or use. The Bixa Orellana is 
chiefly known for producing the seed called in the shops ar- 
notta {rocon, Fr.) and used for colouring cheese ; the pro- 
perties of the arnotta are slightly purgative and stomachic. 
They are all bushes or small trees, and mostly tropical. 
Azaras, Chilian shrubs, with fragrant flowers, are not yet 
known in the gardens of Europe.

Order XIX. CiSTrNEiE. 
The common rock-roses of our gardens give an accurate 
idea of this order, which contains little else. They are all 
very ornamental, and particularly well calculated for covering 
rockwork. The species of Cistus and Helianthemum have 
been multiplied by Dunal in an extravagant manner, as has 
been well demonstrated by Mr. Bentham. They are natives 
of most parts of the world in dry elevated places. The gum

tonic and stomachic properties.

Order XX. CARYOPHY'LLEiE. 

Tliese consist of herbs or low undershrubs, inhabiting the 
mountains and pastures of all parts of the world. In Europe 
and Siberia they are particularly abundant, and least so in 
Africa and South America. Many are common weeds, as 
most of the cerastiums, spergulas, and others. Several of the 
silenes are very ornamental, and among the arenarias are to 
be found some dwarf species of considerable elegance. But it 
is in Dianthus that the pride of the order consists : this genus 
is almost unrivalled for the brilliancy of its colours, the neat- 
ness of its foliage, and the perfume of its flowers. From the 
finest of its species the title of the order has been derived. 
The virtues of Caryophylleae are slight. Saponaria officinalis, 
and one or two others, have been praised for possessing anti- 
syphilitic properties ; the root of Silene virginiana is reputed 
anthelminthic ; and the Arenaria^eploides, being fermented, is 
used by the Icelanders for food.

Separated by M. Decandolle from Caryophyllea?, from 
which it is well distinguished by its fruit having several cells, 
or, in the language of the botanist just named, being formed 
by the cohesion of several carpella. Most of the species 
are pretty plants, bearing yellow, blue, or white flowers. They 
are of immense importance in the world, on account of the 
tenacity of their fibres when mtide into flax. The seeds of 
common flax are between mucilaginous and oily ; the leaves 
of Xinum catharticum and L. ^elaginoides, the latter a native 
of Peru, are purgative.

Order XXII. FRANKENU^C^^. 

Distinguished from Caryopbyllese by the fruit not 'having a 
central separate placenta, but bearing the seeds on the inner 
margin of the valves. Tlie species are natives of arid situ- 
ations in Europe, Africa, and South America. They have 
not much beauty, and no known medical properties. Besides 
the genus here recorded, there are two others mentioned by 
M. Decandolle.

Order XXIII. il/ALVA^CEiE. 
Before this order was dismembered of Bombaceoe and 
Byttner/r2c^^, it contained most of the grandest flowers in 
nature. Even now, the splendour of the various species of 
Malva, y^lthae'a (to which the hollyhock belongs), and //ibis- 
cus, renders it one of the most remarkable groups of plants. 
With the exception of the numerous genus Slda, nearly all 
ikfalvacese are objects worthy of the gardener's care, particu- 
larly those which are hardy. In stove or greenhouse, the 
softness of their branches and leaves renders them peculiarly 
liable to the attacks of the red spider, mealy bug, and scale, 
from which few collections are free ; a circumstance which 
makes them less generally esteemed than the surpassing beauty 
of many of them merits. The greater part of the order is 
clothed with stellate pubescence, and a reniform one- celled 
anther is a character common to the whole. These two pecu- 
liarities, together with the alternate stipulate leaves, distin- 
guish ikfalvaceae from all the rest of Dichlamydese. All the 
species abound in a nutritive mucilage ; a quality which ten- 
ders the young heads of the ochro (/i/ibiscus esculentus), an 
object of great value within the tropics, as an ingredient in 
soups : in Brazil, the Abutilon esculentum serves the same 
purposes. The emollient properties of ^^Ithse'a officinalis, or 
guimauve of the French, are well known to physicians, as a 
remedy for catarrhs and pulmonary complaints : a decoction 
of the leaves of Sphseralcea cisplatina is used for similar ob- 
jects in Brazil. A species of Pavonzflj is employed in the 
latter country as a diuretic, in the form of a decoction. The 
straight shoots of 5ida micrantha are employed as rocket- 
sticks at Rio Janeiro : the chewed leaves of Sida. carpinifolia 
allay the inflammation occasioned by the stings of wasps. 
The tough fibres of many Malvaceae are manufactured into 
cordage : their petals are astringent ; whence those of i/ibis- 
cus i?6sa sinensis are used in China to blacken the eyelashes, 
and the leather of shoes. The fibrous threads in which the 
seeds of Gossypium are enveloped furnish the valuable cot-

threads, when examined by the microscope, will be seen to be

together with greater facility than those of Bombax and several 
Apocyneae, which are destitute of teeth, and which cannot be 
spun into thread without an admixture of cotton.

Order XXIV. BOMBA^CE.E. 
Distinguished from the last by the imbricate aestivation of 
the calyx, and the arrangement of the stamens in five sets, or, 
in Linnean language, brotherhoods. The species are mostly 
fine trees with large showy flowers, and natives of the tropics. 
Some of them are among the largest trees in the world: 
Adanson/flr, the baobab of Senegal, has been seen with a dia- 
meter of twenty-five feet ; and specimens of Bombax Ceiba 
and Eriodendron anfractu5sum, a hundred feet in height, 
are not uncommon. The wood of all the species is light and 
soft, as in ikfalvaceae, from which this order probably does not 
differ in its medicinal properties.

Order XXV. BYTTNER/^^C£:^. 
Much the same kind of plants as those of the last two 
orders, from which they were not formerly distinguished, 
and from which they scarcely differ, except in their bilocular 
anthers. Many of the sterculias are fine umbrageous trees, 
the seeds of which are large and eatable ; especially those of 
the famous kola, which, being chewed, possess the property 
of rendering bad water pleasant to the palate. The seeds of 
the chicha, another and very noble species of the genus, are 
highly esteemed in Brazil for the dessert. Astrapae'a, and 
several other genera related to it, are among the most beauti- 
ful in the world. The flowers of a species of Pentapetes, 
called by the Indians machucunha, give out a mucilaginous 
refrigerant juice, which is employed in gonorrhoea. Gua- 
ziima wlmifolia has its fruit filled with a pleasant mucilage, 
which is sweet and very agreeable ; an extract of the bark of 
the same plant is used in Martinique to clarify sugar; its old 
bark is employed, in the form of a strong decoction, as a sudo- 
rific. Walther/a Douradmha contains a great deal of mu- 
cilage, and is employed by the Brazilians as an antisyphilitic.

Art. IX. NotulcB Botanicce. By G. A. Walker Arnott, Esq. 

{Continued from p. 242.) 

O'RCHis. — Lamarck and Decandolle describe the lip of 
O. laxiflora to be three-lobed, and state that the middle lobe 
is shorter than the lateral ones, and, at the same time, emar- 
ginate ; Willdenow and Villars (under the name of O. ensi- 
folia), and Sprengel, say that it is obcordate, but not lobed. 
With two such different accounts, one can scarcely believe 
that the same plant is intended. Be that as it may, Lamarck 
and DecandoUe's description alone applies to what is found 
in the south of France. When compared with the description 
of O. palustris, it will be found to approach very close ; solely, 
indeed, differing by the middle lobe of the lip being as short 
as the lateral ones. In botli the sepals are acute, thus distin- 
guishing these plants from O. mascula ; and, in both, the sepals 
bent backward, not connivent, separate them from O. morio. 
In O. palustris the labellum, or lip, as to its circumscription, 
is round; in O. laxiflora, triangular, and attached by the 
apex of the triangle. Though some of the above-mentioned 
authors take no notice of the lobes of the lip, I have one 
specimen, from Fos, in Provence, in which they are very 
deeply marked. Merat's O. laxiflora, from the neighbourhood 
of Paris, if his description were made from actual observation, 
accords with that of Villars. 

O^phrys, — Smith, I observe, in the English Flora (vol. iv. 
p. 273.)j has lately added O^phrys arachnites {Jig, 165. a) to 
our British plants. When growing, it is easily distinguished 
from 0. aranifera (5), with which alone, in Britain, it is possible 

A A 2

Nohdi^ BotHnica,

to confound it, by the flesh-coloured sepals, these being green 
in O. aranifera. When dry, it is 
chiefly distinguished by the cris- 
tate appendage at the extremity 
of the lip ; the lip in O. arani- 
fera being simply emarginate. 
There is, however, an interme- 
diate species, which has caused 
great confusion to foreign bota- 
nists ; it is the O. arachnites Lk. 
which Willdenow has impro- 
perly referred to O. aranifera. 
Link expressly speaks of the 
coloured sepals, and says, also, 
that the lip is emarginate, with 
an appendage placed in the notch, — " labii laciniae laterales 
obsoletae, media rotundata emarginata, append ice carnosa in 
emarginatura fusca." Now this species may be a variety of the 
true O. arachnites, but certainly not of O. aranifera. In Link's 
species, however, the appendage is very small and triangular, the 
apex of the triangle pointing forwards ; while, in O. arachnites, 
the appendage is cuneate and large, curled upwards, attached by 
its apex, and the extremity is lobed or cristate. This last I have 
received from the neighbourhood of Paris and from Geneva; 
and have myself gathered it, though very sparingly, at the Pic 
St. Loup, near Montpelier, in company with Mr. Bentham ; 
though, I presume by accident, the locality is omitted in his 
Catalogue des Plantes des Pyrenees et du Bas Langiiedoc, In that 
excellent work I find O. aranifera Sm, stated to be common ; 
I, however, never observed it in Languedoc, and am inclined 
to think that O. arachnites hink is the plant intended. That, 
indeed, is extremely common throughout the south of France, 
and particularly abundant at the Pont du Gard. Of this 
several varieties occur: in some the appendage at the ex- 
tremity of the lip is so small as to be scarcely perceptible. In 
one specimen I have, from M. Requien, of Avignon, found at 
Fos, in Provence, the surface of the lip, as far as I can judge 
by a dried specimen, is of a uniform reddish colour, and not 
marked with yellow lines, and is covered all over with short 
hairs. 

I presume Dr. Smith's O. fucifera {English Flora, iv. p. 32.) 
has green sepals, and is not even a variety of O. aranifera; 
but I have not seen specimens ; and, indeed, of O. aranifera 
itself I judge entirely by descriptions and figures, particularly 
that in English Botany, having neither gathered it myself, nor 
yet received the true plant from correspondents.

Art. I. Ornithologia, or the Birds ; a Poenif in Two Parts : ivith 
an Introduction to their Natural History, and copious Notes, 
By James Jennings, Author of Observations on the Dialects of 
the West of England, London. 12mo, pp. 468. Four Engrav- 
ings on Wood. 

Birds having less brains, and consequently (if we believe 
in theory) more stupidity, than quadrupeds, may, in some 
points of view, appear of inferior interest ; but, as they form 
a very important link in the chain of living existence, much 
credit is due to those authors who, like Mr. Jennings, try to 
diffuse a taste for the study of ornithology. By exhibiting the 
science in varied points of view, it may be made delightful to 
almost every class of persons, and particularly to young 
people. In youth there is an enthusiastic and insatiable desire 
for the study of every branch of natural history. Not a 
flower blows in the meadows, nor an insect flutters by, with- 
out attracting the attention of the young ; and, while we might 
suppose a boy to be foolishly engaged in idle pastime, gather- 
ing daisies and butter-cups, or pursuing butterflies and bees, 
he is, in reality, employed in a more useful study than in 
conning over his (to him unintelligible) class-books: he is 
acquiring ideas of the works of nature, which no class-book 
can give, which no master can instil, and which, in his maturer 
years, he can turn into admirable subjects for philosophical 
reflection, as our author has done his boyish feats of birds- 
nesting, (p. 10.) It is, indeed, much to be regretted that tHie 
study of THINGS is so much thrown into the back-ground, by 
the exclusive attention now bestowed upon words. These 
ought to go hand in hand, for nothing can be more prepos- 
terous than compelling a boy to store up a number of words 
in his memory, which he does not and cannot understand; 
while, on the other hand, he cannot be supposed to retain a 
distinct or lasting recollection of things and facts, without, 
names and words, the only sort of pegs upon which they can 
be permanently hung. Upon this principle, it is surprising at

how early an age children can be instructed in the most in-

Sibylline Z^eaves, 209. 

' As an object of elegant pursuit for country gentlemen, the 
study of ornithology is not inferior to any other department 
of nature. To the sportsman, to the gentleman farmer, and 
to horticulturists, the knowledge of the habits and the food of 
birds is indispensable, inasmuch as ignorance of the subject 
may often give rise to most serious injury and loss. For 
example, in New England the cultivated grounds were some 
years ago much frequented with a species of crow, and the 
farmers, supposing that their crops were thus injured, resolved 
to extirpate the whole race, and offered a price for their heads. 
The proscription was very successfully carried into effect ; but 
the farmers, instead of being gainers, were severe sufferers. 
The crows, it should appear, like the rooks of our own country, 
did not frequent the fields so much for the sake of the grain, 
as to feed upon grubs, which, after the universal massacre of 
the crows, increased so numerously as nearly to destroy the 
entire crops, and threaten a famine. When the error was 
discovered, the crows were as anxiously protected as they had 
been formerly persecuted. Similar instances, in the case of 
rooks, have occurred in Britain. This view of the subject has 
not escaped Mr. Jennings, who makes the house sparrow say, 

** How comes it that the good we do 
Is kept most carefully from view ?

Mr. Jennings has divided his v^^ork into two parts, the first 
comprehending British and European birds, the second foreign 
birds ; the whole being preceded by an introductory sketch 
of the present state of ornithology, and accompanied by what 
the author calls copious, but which we should designate volu- 
minous, notes, and which we should have arranged either in the 
introduction or in an appendix, as, in their present form, they 
both interrupt the current of the verse, and throw important 
facts and subjects into corners, instead of bringing them regu- 
larly and prominently forward. This, however, is an objection 
of small moment ; for many readers are best pleased with a 
little irregularity, and will readily pick up chance seeds of 
knowledge scattered by the way-side, when they would shrink 
from the labour of reaping a whole field, laid out according to 
rule. It is, perhaps, more also in unison with the author's 
design, " to combine the prose portion of the work with familiar 
poetry, so as to render the science altogether more attractive, 
and to exhibit a useful epitome of it." Taking this view of the 
subject, we shall now take a glance at the manner in which Mr. 
Jennings has executed his plan of combining amusement with 
instruction. Respecting nests^ we find the following in the 
author's introduction, which is inscribed to Mrs. Richard 
Kay:- 

" You, LADY ! when that smiling boy. 
Of promise bright, his parents' joy.

To all that's good and great — refin'd.

* " Bewick states that ' a single pair of sparrows, during the time they 
are feeding tfteir young, will destroy about four thousand caterpillars 
weekly.' They feed their young also with many winged insects; in London, 
it is presumed, chiefly with flies." 

" The utility of the goldfinch is peculiarly striking, it feeding in winter, 
when at large, principally on thistle seed : hence it is called the thistle- 
finch." 

We should object to the latter inference of utility, that the only thistle 
seed which the goldfinch can procure in winter must be unproductive, all 
the fertile seed being scattered by the winds during the autumn, — Rev.

This is accompanied by a note, occupying the greater por- 
tion of seven pages, in which brief descriptions are given of 
the nests of several birds ; for example : — 

" The wren's nest," he says, " is globular, and very often 
made of green moss, both within and without. It has a small 
hole on the side of it, just large enough to admit the bird. It 
is generally affixed to some tree, and behind it, at a few feet 
from the ground, so as not to be immediately in sight. The 
wren seems very partial to trees iaving ivy growing about 
them, most probably as, by its leaves, the nest is more effec- 
tually concealed. It does not seem to prefer any particular 
tree : the nest will be found very often attached to the elm or 
the ash ; sometimes against an ivied wall, sometimes in the 
thatch of a house, and sometimes in a hayrick. In such cases, 
'the materials of the nest will often also be varied." In a sub- 
sequent note he says, " Its nest is generally adapted to the 
place against or under which it is made. Thus, although its 
usual structure is gree?i moss, yet, if it build against the side of 
a hayrick, it is composed of hay ; if against a tree covered 
with white moss, it is made of that material. This is not, 
however, an invariable habit, for I have known a wren's nest 
constructed of green moss at the edge of the thatch of a house, 
the colour of which was very different from the nest itself. 
Something, doubtless, depends upon the ease or difficulty with 
which materials can be obtained. Montagu says that the 
lining is invariably feathers. This is not, I think, correct. I 
believe, when made with green moss, its lining is generally of 
the same material." (p. 243.) 

We can add our testimony to that of Mr. Jennings, for the 
incorrect statement of Montagu, which has been copied, we 
perceive, by Atkinson, in his Compciidiiim of the Ornithology 
of Great Briiahi, who says it is "invariably lined with fea- 
thers ; " but, among some hundreds of wrens' nests which we 
have seen, we never saw one lined with feathers, nor any thing 
besides moss, usually some of the softer //ypna. Tke adaptation 
of the external part to the place where it is fixed, is also quite 
at variance with our observation. The wren, indeed, is very 
careful in selecting a snug concealment; but among ivy leaves, 
or under the hanging brow of a river bank, where the nest most 
frequently is, how is this adaptation to be accomplished ? It 
would be wrong, however, to assert that no wren ever built a 



Jennings^s Ornitholbgia, 34j5 

nest like that described by the ingenious and usually accurate 
Montagu. Wilson, in the American Ornithology (vol. i. p. 3.), 
justly remarks that, " though birds of the same species have a 
common form of building, yet do they not all build exactly in 
the same manner ; for as much difference will be found in the 
style, neatness, and finishing of their nests, as in their voices. 
Some appear far superior workmen, and, possibly, age may 
improve them." 

In his account of the nest of the gold-crested wren (Sylvia 
-Regulus), Mr. Jennings is also more correct than the author of 
the Compendium^ who says it " is of a round form, with an 
opening in the side." (p. 97.) Mr. Jennings says, " Nest 
similar to that of the chaffinch, but lined with feathers ; some- 
times placed against a tree covered with ivy, but most com- 
monly beneath the thick branch of a fir." He adds that 
Pennant saj^s it is found principally on oak trees. We, how- 
ever, have paid considerable attention to the habits of this 
beautiful little bird, and can say that we never observed it 
frequenting oaks nor woods, as the author of the Compendium 
states. It chiefly frequents fir and pine plantations, where it 
builds ; and, if it takes short excursions thence, it is only to the 
nearest hedge-row, along which it flits, almost invisible, and 
only to be distinguished by its fairy note, somewhat like the 
ring of a small silver bell. The nest, we think, is more like 
that of the goldfinch than that of the chaffinch, to which Mr. 
Jennings compares it. 

That our author is no servile copier of others, but has 
examuied nature for himself, will appear from these extracts, as 
well as the following : — " The nest of the thrush is, exteriorly, 
composed of green or other moss, and a few straws ; interiorly, 
it is plastered all over with some paste, apparently composed 
of rotten wood, with something to cement it ; it is generally of 
a light buff colour. When dry, it is quite hard, so that the 
eggs, if moved, rattle in the nest. The statement in many of 
our books of natural history, that it is lined with clay, is, as 
far as my experience goes, founded in mistake." (p. 1 9.) 

We agree with Mr. Jennings, that the plaster employed by 
the thrush is not clay; but, though it may appear to him 
similar to rotten wood, he will find that it is chiefly composed 
of the dung of cows. Whether there is not a small intermix- 
ture of clay, however, we cannot undertake to affirm. The 
magpie, a bird not very distantly allied to the ikferulidae, 
certainly uses clay, and in no sparing quantity, to plaster over 
the inside of its thorny tent ; and the house swallow (^irundo 
rustica) forms the chief superstructure of its nest with clay. 



546 Jeimings's OniitJiolbgia. 

In the introductory part, Mr. Jennings has very pro|:)erly 
corrected some of the mistakes of the Hon. Daines Barring- 
ton, in his well-known paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 
on the Singing of Birds ; a paper which is far from accurate, 
either in its facts or its reasonings. Take the following as an 
instance : — 

" Mr. Barrington thinks that the reason vfhy females do not 
sing is, because, if they did, when sitting on their eggs, they 
would be discovered. This is by no means a conclusive rea- 
son ; for I once discovered a thrush's nest, by hearing the 
parent bird sing while sitting on the eggs. Besides, as the 
cock and hen of many species frequently sit on the eggs in 
turn, the female's not singing could be no security to the nest, 
while the cock was sitting and singing there." (p. 65.) 

We confess we are disposed to doubt the fact of either cock 
or hen singing while sitting on their eggs, notwithstanding the 
solitary instance given by Mr. Jennings, on his own observ- 
ation. It would be difficult, indeed, to prove the negative, 
but it is clearly contrary to the uniform instinctive care exhi- 
bited by all birds in concealing their nests. In the case of 
canaries, and other birds which breed in cages, we have never 
observed an instance of any bird singing in the act of incuba- 
tion. Mr. Barrington, however, is altogether wrong in as- 
serting that hen birds never sing. He ought to have been 
certain of the fact before speculating upon it. We have re- 
peatedly heard hen birds sing; and Mr. Sweet, the well- 
known author of The British Warblers, makes the qualified 
statement, that " females seldom sing ; I had a female redstart 
which sang a little ; and female bull-finches sing as frequently 
as the males." Again, Mr. Sweet says, " I have had several 
female birds which never attempted to sing ; but now I have 
two that sing frequently ; one is a female black-cap ; she sings 
a note peculiar to herself, and not the least like the male, or 
any other bird with which I am acquainted. I kept her several 
years before she began to sing. I have also a female willow 
wren, that sings nearly as much as the cock ; this bird was 
bred up from the nest, and did not sing at all the first year. 
Her note is quite different from that of the male, but re- 
sembles it sufficiently to indicate that it belongs to the same 
species." 

Mr. Jennings appears to have a leaning towards a very 
unfounded notion, at which we rather wonder, since he appears 
to be acquainted with the American Ornithology of Wilson. 
" The mocking-bird," he says, " forms a striking exception 
to what is generally esteemed the character of the birds of the 
new world, where the rich, lively, and brilliant hues of the 



Jennings^s Ornithologia, 347 

feathered race are very often accompanied with harsh, mono- 
tonous, and disagreeable notes." (p. S?*.) On the contrary, 
it would appear from Wilson's admirable descriptions, that 
the American song-birds are infinitely more numerous than 
those of Europe, and many of them superior to our most cele- 
brated songsters. From the first four volumes, alone, w^e 
made out a table of no fewer than twenty-two American song- 
birds, which we may probably insert in a future page. In 
speaking of the wood thrush (Turdus melodus), Wilson re- 
marks that it " serenades the woods, with notes as clear as 
those of the nightingale. Previous naturalists deny it to have 
any song but a single scream, confounding it with the Turdus 
minimus of Catesby, and aifording the disciples of BuiFon an 
argument for his absurd theory of its being the Turdus miisi- 
cus of Europe, degenerated by food and climate, and by Hving 
in a savage country, where the cries of all birds are harsh and 
unpleasant ! " {American Ornithology, vol. iii. p. 34.) 

Our author adverts, very briefly, to the great rapidity re- 
markable in the flight of some species of birds. The most 
extraordinary fact which has come to our knowledge on the 
subject, is given on the high authority of our intelligent corre- 
spondent, Mr. Audubon, respecting the passenger pigeon of 
America (Columba migratoria). He has shot that bird, he 
says, during his hunting excursions through the forests ; and, 
on dissection, found its stomach full of fresh rice, which, to 
have resisted the digestive process, must have been swallowed 
not many hours preceding its death, but could not have been 
obtained within 800 miles of the place where it was killed. 

Our notices have been hitherto chiefly taken from the prose 
portion of the work, but it would be injustice to the author 
not to give a fair specimen of his poetry, of which the merit is 
almost as various as the measures. We select 

" The Goldfinch's Song.

Before concluding, we must enter a decided protest against 
the introduction of the harsh-sounding terms which Mr. Jen- 
nings has Anglicised from the Greek and Latin of Mr. Vigors. 
We put it to the good taste of our author, whether he does 
not lose much more than he gains, by calling the cuckoo a 
Cuculid, the nightingale a Sylviad, the vulture a Vulturid, the 
parrot a Psittacid, the swallow a Hirundinid, &c. To call a 
pigeon or a partridge a Rasor, a woodpecker a Scansor, a 
thrush a Dentirost, or a kingfisher a Fissirost, is to our ears 
most grating and repulsive. The following lines, referring to 
the nightingale and the cuckoo, require no comment : — 

" What though there no Luscinian Salvia's sweet throat. 
Nor of Cuculid, Scansor * cano7'ouSj the note ; 
Yet the warblers abound.*' Page 305. 

The chief merit of the book, we conceive, lies in the variety 
of facts which the author has selected, both from his reading 
and from his own portfolio. It cannot fail to be a useful pre- 
sent to the young naturalist. R. I.

Pars IV. Londini, Wood, 428. Strand, 1828. 

We have hitherto omitted to announce the publication of 
the fourth and concluding part of Haworth's Lepidoptera 
Britdfinica, of which the first part was given to the public so 
long ago as 1803. The work, we happen to know, would 
have been completed long before now, had it not been for the 
unfortunate failure of the printer to whom the copy was con- 
signed, and who afterwards, owing to some unaccountable 
misunderstanding, refused either to print the remaining sheets, 
or to give back the manuscript to the author. However, " it 
is better late than never :" the concluding part at length made 
its appearance in the spring of the present year, to the no 
small satisfaction of many an entomologist, who previously 
possessed only an imperfect portion of a very useful work. 
The author has declined to introduce into this last part the 
more modern alterations and discoveries in entomological 
science, and has printed it in all respects uniformly with the 
preceding parts, just as it was originally written many years 

* With all deference to Mr. Vigors, on whose authority, we presume, 
Mr. Jennings calls the cuckoo a scansory or climber, we hesitate not to affirm 
that cuckoos do not climbs though their feet have two toes before and two 
behind, like the parrots and creepers. — Rev. 



Ha'wori/i^s Lepidoptera Brifdnmca. 349 

ago. In doing this, he has judged, we think, wisely; for, 
otherwise, the work would not have been all of a piece, and 
would, perhaps, have brought to our recollection the opening 
lines of Horace's Art qfPoetn/, — 

" Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam 
Jungere si velit," &c. 

We rejoice, however, to learn, by the postscript, that Mr. 
Haworth contemplates a new edition and entire revision of 
the whole. The science of entomology has undergone great 
alterations as to its nomenclature, divisions of genera, &c., 
since the earlier parts were printed. It has become much 
more popular, and more extensively studied. The original 
work, too, though not free from errors and omissions (as the 
author candidly acknowledges), is yet invaluable to the British 
lepidopterist, and has become exceedingly scarce. The im- 
pression was a small one, and the earlier parts have long been 
out of print. The new discoveries also made in this depart- 
ment of natural history, since the year 1 803, are numerous, 
and highly interesting. In short, a revised edition of the 
work, or a new work on a similar plan, is required by the 
present more advanced state of the science. No one (we 
speak advisedly in saying this) is better qualified for such 
an undertaking than Mr. Haworth, who, in addition to long 
practical experience, possesses an extensive and profound 
knowledge of entomology, a most accurate and discriminating 
eye, and a dexterous facility in describing that most beautiful 
order of insects of which he treats. We sincerely hope he 
will put his intended plan in execution, and without delay. 
There can be little doubt but that such a work as he contem- 
plates would meet with more encoumgement from the public 
of the present day, than fell to the lot of Lepidoptera Britan- 
nica in 1803. It is almost unnecessary to add that, as vast 
alterations in the nomenclature have taken place since that 
period, there should be in the new work a constant reference 
to the old. The glossary, also, of entomological terms, 
together with a set of explanatory figures, which, though 
never executed, formed a part of the original design, should 
by no means be omitted. 

The present part contains a description of ten genera of 
minute moths, viz. Erminea, Capillaria, Dasycerus, Chelkria, 
Gracillaria, Porrectaria, Ypsolophus, Recurvaria, Incurvaria, 
and Tinea; the whole comprehending about 247 species. It 
is unnecessary to say more on this concluding part, as no 
doubt it will be in the hands of every entomologist who pos- 
sesses or can procure the preceding volumes.

F.H.S., Author of Pomarium Britannicum. London. Col. pi. 
1/. 10*. ; plain 1/. I*. 

Sir, 

I COULD wish that you had desired my opinion of any other 
work, rather than of that you have sent me. For several rea- 
sons I could wish this : first, because I admire that maxim, 
which recommends us, where we cannot say any thing favour- 
able, not to say any thing at all ; next, because it is awkward 
to point out the defects of others, while we are probably exhi- 
biting our own at the same moment ; and, lastly, because I 
am so naturally disposed to think well of, and to feel kindly 
towards, any person whose mind is accustomed to' dwell among 
flowers and trees, that it is doing a personal unkindness to 
myself to speak as, in this instance, sincerity compels me to 
speak. 

From the title of the work. Floral Emblems, I expected 
to see a neat little pocket volume, light as the subject of which 
it treated ; or a thin quarto, with finely coloured plates, brought 
out altogether in a costly, and album-like style, and adapted 
to take its place among the elegant knick-knacks of a lady of 
fashion. I expected to have found in it the figures of such 
plants as have, either in this or any other country, been ge- 
nerally or poetically associated with certain ideas ; together 
with some account of each, explaining where or with whom such 
associations originated ; interspersed with appropriate quota- 
tions, and, occasionally, with interesting anecdotes. I fancied 
how agreeably many young ladies, who have more leisure 
than they know how to enjoy, would amuse themselves in 
tying up sentimental bouquets, and painting pretty devices ; 
but when I saw the book, and when I read it (with very much 
more attention than I should have done, had you not desired 
my opinion of it), I was led to doubt whether there was any 
one class of persons with whom it was likely to become a fa- 
vourite. Those ladies for whom it would seem the best 
adapted, and who might be supposed to welcome the sort of 
employment into which it might lure them, would, I suspect, 
find it troublesome to refer so frequently to its pages, to ascer- 
tain the signification of the various flowers ; for many of them 
are so arbitrary and vague, that there is nothing to assist the me- 
mory in retaining them. They might receive the rose as the em- 
blem of beauty; the lily, of innocence; the violet, of modesty or 
humility; the holly, of Christmas merriment; or the mistletoe, 
of a stolen kiss : these would be familiar to them. The author 
might reasonably expect them to receive, as importations from 



Phillips's Floral Emhlems. 351 

foreign lands, the rose, in progressive stages, as expressive of 
a growing love ; the white water-lily, of unsullied purity ; or 
the pomegranate, as the emblem of fertility; these, and many 
such, they might have received graciously, and Mr. Phillips 
might even have exercised his fancy in imagining new associa- 
tions, so long as they were neither merely arbitrary, nor, in 
themselves, contradictory to the beauty and beneficence of 
nature. So long as the emblems he offered had a meaning 
and a grace, they might have been favourably received ; but 
the majority of them appear to possess neither of these re- 
quisites. Disdain is to be expressed by the Yellow Carnation : 
Mr. Phillips does not tell us why ; but goes on to speak of the 
vanity of the Greeks, and the arbitrary power exercised by 
their sultans, and ends with a quotation from Shakspeare, 
which is equally irrelevant. Clematis is symbolical of Artifice; 
for, " when artifice is innocently resorted to, for the purpose 
of giving pleasure, it may be compared to the agreeable 
fragrancy of the sweet Clematis." The comparison might 
be made with any fragrant flower; and it is not, perhaps, 
very often that artifice is " innocently resorted to." TheSiin- 
^ flower is indicative of False Uiches ; because " gold of itself, 
however abundant, cannot render a person rich, who is poor 
in spirit." Indeed ! is wealth synonymous with magnanimity, 
in Mr. Phillips's vocabulary ? It would be well if the want of 
gold were equally powerless to make those poor, whose spirits 
were not so. The Blackthorn represents Difficulty : " It is 
difficult to penetrate a thick fence of blackthorn ; some per- 
sons make a difficulty of Wcilking over a heath, others, who 
mistake impossibilities for difficulties, can only be convinced 
by conviction^ which frequently comes too late." With the 
Saffron is associated the phrase, Do not abuse, " Too liberal 
a use of this cordial and stimulating flower is said to destroy 
the reason, or cause the death, of those who indulge in it." It 
may be my own dulness, but I do not see what reference the 
following quotation has, either to the plant, or to the author's 
mention of it ; — 

" Some praise at morning, what they blame at night, 
But always think the last opinion right." 

Neither do I find any sufficient reason for making the delicate 
Privet the emblem of Defence (the Holly would be a stouter 
one) ; the Marjoram^ of Bluster ,• the Osier^ of Frankness ; the 
Cereus (one of the most beautiful of flowers), oi Horror, Here 
I come to another objection, and a grave one : why does Mr. 
Phillips seek to associate flowers, which naturally present agree- 
able images to the mind as well as to the eye, with such ideas as. 



S52 Phillips's Floral Emblems. 

these, — Vidgar viinds, Envy, Disgust, Voraciousiicss, War, 
Suspicion, Hatred, &c. ; and why does he represent th^ 
latter by the Sweet Basil, by a plant associated with the most 
tender love, as he may find in the works of Boccacio, and in 
two poets of our own times, neither of whom should have been 
forgotten, and, least of all, he whose body was too early laid to 
rest, to aiFord his great genius time for full expansion ? 

Why does Mr. Phillips represent Celibacy by a lady with 
eight husbands (Epilobiura angustifolium), and one of the par- 
ticular favourites of Flora, who is not supposed to advocate 
that virtue ? Why make the Lady' s-smocJc the emblem of 
Paternal Error, because Shakspeare says that Lear wore the 
Cuckoo FloxsxT in his flowery crown ; when, in the same page, 
he quotes lines from Shakspeare, designating the Butter-cup 
by that name, and expressly distinguishing it from the Lady's- 
smock ? Why, speaking of the B£d Valerian, does he quote 
a line applicable to a very different species ? " Grey loose- 
strife here, and pale valerian spring." And why give the com- 
man Laurel as the emblem of Glory, instead of the true Laurel, 
the Bay (Zaurus nobilis) ? But it is vain to multiply ques- 
tions (of which there are many more to ask), until these have 
been answered. 

The language in which Mr. Phillips expresses his ideas, is 
as obscure and incorrect as the ideas themselves ; one glaring 
instance of the latter, is the frequent misuse of the word 
and, " The language of flowers is said to be as old as the 
world, and the antiquity of floral emblems as great as that of 
love itself; and by whom it is supposed to have been in- 
vented," &c. 

" That the use of heraldic emblems greatly increased 
throughout Europe, during the crusades, is generally known ; 
and where, as a flattering badge, every private soldier wore a 
cross of red stuff, sewed to his surcoat." 

" This month (January) and the next were added to the 
year by Numa Pompilius, and had the name from Janiis, a 
Roman god, painted with two faces (signifying providence or 
wisdom), judging by things past of things to come." 

Speaking of the Cyclamen, Mr. Phillips says : " We pre- 
sent this emblem, with a hope that the poets will not longer 
remain too diffident to let this pretty plant escape the harmony 
of their song," &c. 

I wish I could find something to speak well of in this vo- 
lume, but 1 am obliged to own that even the plates are bad. 
As a work of art, I am not qualified to speak ; I refer only to 
the inaccuracy. The holly, in particular, is so little like a 
holly, that I said to a friend, as 1 looked at it, " This should

have been a holly, but I see it is not'' Upon reference, I was 
somewhat surprised to find that it was intended for one. The 
device representing Pensiveness arising from Solitude^ has the 
situation of the plants exactly the reverse of what they ought 
to be. It now represents, according to Mr. Phillips's emblems, 
Solitude arising from Pensiveness, 

Unless they were intended always to be represented by 
paintings, the party-coloured leaves must be rather difficult to 
obtain, as described ; and it might happen that a lady might 
not have a bird's nest at hand, when she was desirous of send- 
ing to her lover a floral invitation to visit her in the months of

Art. IV. An Introduction to Geology ; comprising the Elements 
of the Science in its present advanced State, and all the recent 
Discoveries : with an Outline of the Geology of England and 
Wales. By Robert Bakewell. The Third Edition, entirely 
recomposed, with new Plates, pp. 540, 8vo. Longman & Co. 

Geology, or the science of the earth, has only been practi- 
cally and scientifically cultivated for about half a century. 
What was formerly called geology, consisted of speculations 
respecting the formation of the world, which partook more of 
the character of poetry than of sound philosophy. Geology, 
as a science, can only proceed like the other sciences, by a 
patient investigation of facts, and by an extended comparison 
of analogous phenomena in various situations. Werner and 
some of the earlier practical geologists, who first examined 
attentively the structure of the earth's surface in the particular 
countries where they resided, fell into the very common error 
of forming premature generalisations, and took for granted 
that the same series of strata, and the same rocks, which they 
observed around them, were spread universally over the 
globe, in the same invariable order of succession. On this 
principle the system of Werner was founded, and its sup- 
porters maintained that it was perfect in all its parts, and was 
not less entitled to an unhesitating assent, than the Newtonian

system of the universe. With the Wernerian system were 
mixed up various crude speculations, respecting the formation 
of rocks, which were in direct opposition to all the known 
properties of matter. Thus it was stated that the rocks and 
strata which form the surface of the globe, though composed 
of insoluble matter, were once all dissolved in the ancient 
ocean, and that this ocean after it had deposited a small part 
of its contents, was capable of supporting animal life. For 
some years after the commencement of the present cen- 
tury, the doctrine of Werner was (with a few exceptions) 
generally maintained in this country, and those who dared to 
dissent from it were considered as dangerous heretics. The 
Wernerian system derived much of its strength from the 
circumstance, that most geological writers went for their 
illustrations to Germany or countries more remote, and the 
reader had no opportunity of verifying or disproving their 
accuracy. The distinguishing character of Mr. Bakewell's 
Introduction to Geology, when it first appeared in 1813, was, 
that the illustrations of the principles of the science were 
chiefly taken from situations in our own island, which were 
accessible to the readers ; he also openly attacked many of 
the glaring errors of the Wernerian system. The second 
edition contained a more ample account of English geology, 
and was favourably received both in this country and on the 
Continent; it was translated into German, and published at 
Friburg, the seat of Werner's labours and celebrity. The 
distinguishing character of the present enlarged edition of the 
Introduction to Geology, consists in the particular illustrations 
of geology, by comparisons of the rock formations in England 
with those in France, Switzerland, and Savoy, which the 
author has examined. It contains also a concise but clear 
account of the numerous discoveries of the bones of new 
genera and species of quadrupeds, found in the secondary and 
tertiary strata, which have recently given much additional 
interest to the study of geology. 

The first chapter, which is introductory, treats chiefly on 
what may be regarded as belonging to Physical Geography : 
the form and density of the earth ; the proportion of the land 
and water; and the great changes which the surface of the 
globe appears to have undergone, as indicated by the fossil 
remains of marine animals, imbedded in solid rocks at the 
height of many thousand feet above the present level of the 
sea. What the author particularly presses on the attention 
of the student is, the order in which the fossil remains are 
distributed, as proving that each stratum in which they are 
contained was once the uppermost solid part of the globe, 



BakevoelVs Introduction to Geology. S55 

and that the strata have been deposited in succession, at dis- 
tant epoch?. There is a note on the total quantity of salt 
contained in the sea, which we think curious and original. 
" T/ie inquiry has often been made, whence did the sea 
derive its saline contents? It has been supposed, by some 
naturalists, that the salt in the sea has been gradually aug- 
mented by saline particles brought into it by rivers, but this 
cause is totally inadequate to explain the immense quantity of 
salt existing in the whole mass of the ocean. If the average 
depth of the sea be ten miles, and it contains 2J per cent of 
salt, were the water entirely evaporated, the thickness of the 
saline residue would exceed 1000 feet." (p. 9.) Our author 
proceeds to observe that, could this salt by any cause be re- 
moved and spread upon all the present continents, it would 
cover them with a stratum of solid rock salt, which would be 
more than half a mile in thickness. 

The second chapter, On Petrifactions or Fossil Organic 
Remains, is new. The penetration of animal or vegetable 
substances with mineral matter, it appears from an experiment 
of the late Dr. Jenner (stated p. 31.), may be effected in 
a much shorter time than has been generally supposed; 
it is, therefore, from the nature of these organic remains, 
rather than from their state of preservation, that their 
high antiquity can be inferred. Mr. Bakewell adopts the 
Cuvierian classification of animals, and has given a succinct 
account of the geological distribution of fossil remains belong- 
ing to the four grand divisions which Cuvier has established 
in the animal kingdom. What the author conceives most 
particularly desirable is, to mark the first appearance of 
those orders of animals whose organisation proves that they 
existed under different conditions from the preceding orders. 
The animals, for instance, that possessed organs for moving 
on their bellies like the snail, and had heads and eyes, were 
the inhabitants of shallow waters or of rocks near the surface ; 
and the first appearance of vertebrated animals with feet, 
indicates the existence of dry land or marshes in the vicinity, 
at the period of their existence. 

Mr. Bakewell thinks that too much importance has been 
attached by modern geologists to the minutiae of conchology. 
" We know so little," he observes, " respecting the forms or 
habits of the animals classed by the conchologist from their 
shells, that we are far from certain, whether many shells 
which are regarded as belonging to different species or even 
genera, are not mere varieties of form, occasioned by differ- 
ence of age or situation. In animals which have no internal 
skeleton to determine their form, the construction of the ex^

ternal shell may probably admit of considerable variation, 
under a change of circumstances. In attempting to ascertain 
the identity of distant strata, we ought to bear in mind that 
there is another circumstance, independently of climate, that 
may have occasioned the same stratum to have been the 
abode or sepulchre of very different ordei-s of animals. The 
depth of the ocean may have varied very much even in con- 
tiguous situations; and, in distant countries, the difference of 
depth may have been very great, and one part might support 
genera of pelagian animals (or those which live in deep seas), 
while a more shallow part might be tenanted by different 
genera or even orders of animals, whose organisation fitted 
them for moving nearer the surface of the water.'* Some 
naturalists seem delighted with forming new species from 
every slight variation in the form of the shell, and boldly 
pronounce, from such uncertain data, that fossil shells are 
different from existing species : this Mr. Bakewell thinks " to 
be not more wise, than it would be to class individual men as 
belonging to different species, on account of the different forms 
of their noses." 

The remarkable fact, that no vestiges of human remains 
have been discovered with those of the more ancient inhabit- 
ants of the globe, is at present fully confirmed ; nor have any 
fossil bones of monkeys been hitherto found. Our author, 
however, observes, that the vast diluvial beds of gravel and 
clay, and the upper strata in Asia, have not yet been scienti- 
fically explored, and both sacred and profane writers agree in 
regarding the temperate regions of that continent as the cradle 
of the human race. 

Chapter 3., On the Mineral Substances that compose the 
Crust of the Globe, is nearly the same as in the former edition. 
Chapter 4"., On the Principles of Stratification, is new and im- 
portant. Every one who travels through a country for the first 
time, thinks himself competent to discover at one glance the 
direction and arrangement of the strata ; but Mr. Bakewell ob- 
serves, that it is often extremely difficult to trace the stratifica- 
tion correctly, and that many geologists who have enjoyed a 
high reputation, appear to have had very imperfect notions of 
stratification. M. D*Aubuison, in his Traite de Geogfiosiey 
published in 1819, has given examples of stratification which 
never did, nor ever could, occur in nature. 

The curved stratification of the calcareous mountains of 
the Alps and Jura, and the optical illusions to which they 
give rise, are particularly described by Mr. Bakewell, and ex- 
plained by diagrams. 



Bak€*welVs Introduction to Geology ~ 357 

Chapters 5 and 6., On the Rocks generally denominated Pri- 
mary. This class Mr. Bakewell limits to granite, gneiss, and 
mica slate, and the rocks which are commonly associated with 
or imbedded in them. The three former rocks he regards as 
merely modes of the same substances, being essentially com- 
posed of the same earths, but different circumstances attend- 
ing their formation have disposed them to assume a granitic 
structure in one part, and in another to separate into laminae, 
or to take a slaty form. The indications of the present exist- 
ence of subterranean fire beneath the granite of the Alps 
and of Auvergne in France, and, according to Humboldt, in 
the Andes, would, our author observes, render it probable 
that these rocks are of igneous origin ; and the near connec- 
tion there appears to exist between granite and other rocks 
allied to volcanic rocks, tends to confirm this opinion. The 
granite of the Alps, Mr. Bakewell states, rises in nearly vertical 
beds, which have been elevated, together with the secondary 
strata, after the formation of the latter; whereas, in some 
parts of England, the granite and the slate associated with it, 
though rising in elevated beds like those of the Alps, are 
covered by horizontal secondary strata, which must have heen 
deposited after the elevation of the primary beds. Hence Mr. 
Bakewell infers that the granite of England is more ancient 
than that of the Alps. Two original sections are given ; one ex- 
plaining the structure of the Alps, and the other the structure 
of the granitic rocks and the secondary strata at Charnwood 
Forest, in Leicestershire, which will enable the reader to 
judge of the accuracy of the inference respecting their dif- 
ferent ages. 

Chapter 7., OnTransition Rocks, or the lowest rocks in which 
organic remains are found. Mr. Bakewell observes that foreign 
geologists have not unfrequently classed the upper secondary 
strata with transition rocks, owing to the highly indurated 
and crystalline state in which the secondary strata occur, 
particularly in the Alps. Hence erroneous accounts have 
been given of the bones of vertebrated animals in transition 
rocks; whereas the rocks in which they are found are not 
more ancient than the English lias and oolite. Some inte- 
resting observations on the conformable transition rocks will 
be found at the end of this chapter. 

Chapter 8., On the Regular Coal Formation ; chapter 9., On 
Unconformable Rocks of Porphyry, Trap, and Basalt; and 
chapter 10., A Retrospective View of Geological Facts, contain 
many important illustrations of English geology; and, in the 
chapter on the coal strata, there are some observations on the 
search for coal in situations beyond the limits of the present 

BB 3 



358 BakewelPs Introduction to Geology. 

known coal districts, which well deserve the attention of landed 
proprietors. The parts that relate to the original formation 
of coal in fresh-water lakes or marshes, will claim the atten- 
tion of the speculative geologist. Chapters 1 1. to 13. describe 
the Upper Secondary Strata, from the magnesian limestone to 
chalk. The different formations comprised in this class were, 
till very recently, little studied either in this country or on the 
Continent. The transition rocks contain almost exclusively 
the remains of marine animals. The coal strata, resting upon 
the transition strata, contain almost exclusively the remains of 
vegetables, and occasionally strata with fresh-water shells. 
•' A great change appears to have taken place in the condition 
of our planet after the deposition of the coal strata ; for the 
upper secondary strata contain principally the remains of ma- 
rine animals, and it is in these strata that the bones of verte- 
brated animals are first distinctly observed. Among these we 
find the bones of the mighty monsters of an ancient creation, 
whose extraordinary forms are still more astonishing than 
theii immense magnitude. Some of these animals of the 
saurian or lizard tribe attained the length of forty feet or 
more, and appear, from the structure of the teeth and the or- 
gans of motion, to have united to the voracity of the croco- 
dile, the power of darting through the water on their prey 
with inconceivable rapidity. Others had necks so long, that 
when extended out of the water they must have resembled 
immense hydras." 

Much obscurity formerly prevailed respecting the classifica- 
tion of the secondary strata on the Continent. This Mr. Bake- 
well has attempted to unravel. He explains the points of resem- 
blance and dissimilarity which exist between the magnesian 
limestone, the red marl, and lias of England, and the zetch- 
stein, the gres bigarre, the calcaire a greyphites, and the mus- 
chelkalk of the Continent. Mr. Bakewell states that the lower 
part of the lias is wanting in the English strata, and that the 
gres rouge ancien, the gres des vosges, and the gres bigarre of 
the French, are only the lower, middle, and upper parts of the 
red marl and sandstone, which are more fully developed in 
France than in England. The difference between the French 
and English formations of red marl and lias is not greater 
than what exists in distant parts of the same formation in 
England. Our author has also traced th« identity of the 
English lias and oolites, with the calcarean formation of the 
Jura and the Alps. 

A series of fresh-water strata, between the oolite and the 
chalk, occurs in the southern counties of England ; but tliesc 
are probably local formations ; they are remarkable for con-

taining the remains of an herbivorous animal of the lizard 
family, seventy feet in length. Our limits will not permit us 
to dwell on chapter 13., which describes the Chalk Formation. 
Chapter 14., On the Tertiary Formations, above the chalk 
strata, is new. The existence and extent of the tertiary strata, 
in Europe, were, till recently, imperfecdy known. It is in 
these strata that we first meet with the bones of large mam- 
miferous quadrupeds, which belong to genera or species no 
longer existing on the globe. In these strata we also find 
the alternation of the remains of marine animals with beds 
that contain exclusively the remains of land and fresh-water 
animals, which indicate that a great portion of Europe has 
alternately been covered by the sea, and by fresh-water lakes. 
In England the tertiary formations are imperfectly deve- 
loped; the extent which they cover, in this country, is 
marked on the geological map that accompanies the present 
volume ; under the map there is a small section of the vale of 
Thames, which shows the arrangement of the tertiary beds, 
over the chalk, in the vicinity of London. 

Chapters 15, 16., On Volcanoes and Volcanic Rocks; and on 
the agency of subterranean fire in" the formation of rocks and 
strata. In these chapters we have a succinct account of volcanic 
phenomena, and a comparison between ancient and recent 
volcanoes. In a former state of our planet (Mr. Bakewell 
observes) the internal fire must have been more intense than 
since the records of authentic history ; this is shown by the 
remains of ancient craters, which far exceed the magnitude 
of any that are active at the present time ; and the craters 
being formed by the eruption of volcanic matter, their size 
bears evidence of the magnitude of their former operations. 
The enormous craters, many leagues in extent, had, doubt- 
less, an important office to perform in nature ; and it cannot, 
our author observes, be unreasonable to infer that the earth 
is the great laboratory, where the materials were prepared 
that form its surface, and were thrown out either as melted 
lava, or in aqueous solution, or in a gaseous state, &c. 
Siliceous earth is found in hot springs ; and hence, he says, we 
may infer that many siliceous rocks and veins were depo- 
sited by subterranean waters at a high temperature. This 
opinion, which was advanced by Mr. Bakewell in his second 
edition in 1815, has recently been adopted by that eminent 
geologist, M. A. Brongniart. The following chapters. On 
Metallic Beds and Veins, and On Diluvial and Alluvial Depo- 
sitions ; and chapter 1 9., On the Formation of Valleys, and on 
Deluges and Denudations, are replete with interesting matter,

which our limits will not allow us to notice. Chapter 20., On 
the Geology of England and Wales, contains a more distinct 
account of the secondary and tertiary formations, than was 
given in the second edition. Our author is inclined to 
believe that a range of primary mountains once extended, 
from east to west, across this country, of which the Charn- 
wood Forest hills, the low sienitic hills in Warwickshire, 
and the Malvern hills in Gloucestershire and Herefordshire, 
are the remaining nuclei; and that these hills were once 
united, and opposed a barrier to the farther extension of the 
upper secondary strata; for beyond these hills the lias, 
oolite, and chalk, no where appear on the western side of Eng- 
land. 

The present edition of this work contains one half more 
letter-press than the second edition ; but are published at the 
same price, being printed in a smaller type. 

A useful index and explanation of terms are added. From 
the clear manner in which the principles of the science were 
stated in the Introduction to Geology^ and the variety of ori- 
ginal information which it contained respecting the geology 
of England, it contributed much to the diffusion of a taste for 
geological enquiries in this country. The present edition con- 
tains all the principal discoveries that have since been made, 
and is replete with much valuable additional matter, derived 
from the author's extensive researches in Great Britain, and 
various parts of the continent of Europe. T.

The Scientific Journals. 

J3rande*s Quarterly Journal^ for Juncy contains some interesting papers, 
but especialK' one, entitled Illustrations of Nature, or the Arrangement 
of Physical Existence, indicated in Outline, by G. T. B. The writer main- 
tains that the three kingdoms of nature are " arbitrary and incorrect 
divisions." This is so contrary to the common sense of mankind in all 
ages and countries, that the writer cannot hope for many converts to his 
opinion. But all great and general views, all comprehensive theories, are 
good, as tending to cultivate the higher powers of the mind. A good deal 
has been said of late in favour of the quinary, septenary, and circular sys- 
tems. G. T. B. suspects the "trine distribution" to be universally pre- 
valent ; and, for having had his attention directed to this principle, he 
acknowledges his obligation to Trilogeneay the philosophic work of Mr. 
George Field. After three or four pages of discussion, the following tt^ular 
view is given : —

There is a paper on the proceedings of the Royal Institution, which 
shows the prosperous state of that body. A great number of lectures, on 
very interesting subjects, have been delivered and numerously attended, 
much interesting discussion has taken place, and a great variety of curious, 
historical, or useful objects exhibited at the weekly evening meetings. From 
the collections in natural history, we learn (extract from Ann.Lmn. de Paris) 
that plants with pointed leaves and spines attract electricity; that electrified 
seeds pass more rapidly through the first periods of vegetation, than such as 
are not electrified ; and that electrified roses flower more rapidly and abun- 
dantly. 

The Philosophical Magazine y for July, possesses its usual interest; that for 
August contains a paper from the Philosophical Transactions for 1828, 
part i., by Sir Humphrey Davy, in which volcanic fires are accounted for 
by the exposure of the metals of earths and alkalies to air and water, and 
also the formation of lavas and basalts, and many other crystalline rocks, 
explained from the slow cooling of the products of such combustion. 

GiWs Technological Repository, for July, contains an animated article on 
the delight and instruction which flow from the study of natural history, 
" whenever it is ,pursued, not merely in a scientific, but in a truly philoso- 
phical spirit," taken from BlachwoocVs Magazine. " In speaking of the 
effect of such studies on the temper of the mind, in tranquillising it, we 
cannot help noticing the natural calmness, independent of those other 
affections which attend such studies, arising out of the very nature of the 
objects themselves, about which the naturalist is occupied, and out of the 
manner in which he is occupied about them." In the August Number is 
the continuation of Mr. Carpenter's experiments with the microscope 
on insects and their eggs, and a paper on the Ichneumon Fly, by Mr. 
Carpenter. " There are several species of ichneumon which make thin- 
nings among the caterpillars of the cabbage butterfly. The process of 
one species is this : while the caterpillar is feeding, the ichneumon fly 
hovers over it, and, with its piercer, perforates the fatty part of the 
caterpillar's back in many places, and in each deposits an egg, by means 
of the two parts of the sheath uniting together, and thus forming a 
tube down which the egg is conveyed into the perforation made by the 
piercer of the fly. The caterpillar, unconscious of what vvill ensue, keeps 
feeding on, until it changes into a chrysalis; while in that torpid state, the 
eggs of the ichneumon are hatched, and the interior of the body of the 
caterpillar serves as food for the caterpillars of the ichneumon fly. When 
these have fed their accustomed time, and are about to change into the 
pupa state, they, by an instinct given them, attack the vital part of the 
caterpillar (a most wonderful economy in nature, that this process should 
be delayed until they have no more occasion for food). They then spin 
themselves minute cases within the body of the caterpillar ; and instead 
of a butterfly coming forth (which, if a female, would have probably laid 
bix hundred eggs, thus producing as many caterpillars, whose food would

be the cabbage), a race of these little ichneumon flies issues forth, ready ta 
perform the task assigned them, of keeping within due limits those fell de- 
stroyers of our vegetables." (p. 84.) 

The spider also is attacked by the ichneumon, »nd a small fly, whose 
larva is very destructive to the grains of wheat, is also said to be kept within 
due limits by the same insect. The caterpillars of the magpie moths, which 
feed on currant leaves, those of the moth which feeds on bent grass and 
ribwort, and probably various other caterpillars, are liable to become their 
nidi. One species lives on the aphides which infest the rose tree, and Mr. 
Carpenter saw a large species of ichneumon come forth from the chrysalis 
case of a fly of the genus Musca. It appears that different species of ich- 
neumons sometimes deposit their eggs in the bodies of the same caterpillar, 
and that many of the cynips, or gnats, which breed within the dog-rose and 
oak apples, are destroyed by ichneumons depositing their eggs within the 
cells of the cynips, and Mr. Marsham, as we are informed by Mr. SamoueHe, 
in his very valuable work, The Entoviologist^ s Useful Comjjendium^ observed 
in Kensington Gardens, in June 1827, the /chneumon manifest^tor on the 
top of a post, depositing its eggs in the holes of the wild bee (^^is maxil- 
losa), and, no doubt, in the larva or young bees which were in these holes. 

Brewster's Journal^ for July, contains a great variety of interesting 
information on subjects of natural history. The first article, by J. Grant, 
Esq., on the Ourang-outang of Borneo, is very curious and interesting. Its 
face is said to be strangely human ; " nor is it in his physiognomy alone 
that this animal bears so much resemblance to the human being." In a 
considerable number of points it differs from the other species of apes, 
and in all of these points it differs by approaching to the human species. 
The creature may be tickled, and laughs, and walks upright. He is, how- 
ever, only 2 ft. 2 in. high, and weighs but 22 lbs. avoirdupois. A number 
of other curious particulars we have extracted for our Collectanea. 

Jaiiiesori^s Philosophical Journal^ for June, contains, as usual, a number of 
valuable papers; among others, the conclusion of the Geology of Nithsdale, 
by our correspondent, J. S. Menteath, Esq. jun., formerly noticed (p. 171.) 
as important in an agricultural point of view. He remarks that the 
Scotch fir (Pinus sylv^stris) does not harden its wood well, when growing 
on the grey wacke ; but that the contrary happens with the larch (Pinus 
Z/arix), its wood being sound and good, and perfect at the heart. " The 
larch grows naturally only on the primitive mountains, as the granite, gneiss, 
and the like rocks of that class of the Alps, in Switzerland. And it is most 
curious to observe, that, on the whole range of the Jura mountains, sepa- 
rating that country from France, and being a limestone formation, rising to 
an elevation of several thousand feet, not a single self-sown larch can be 
discovered." Advancing, however, from this range into Switzerland, where 
the primitive formation abounds, we find the larch indigenous, and attaining 
to a great size. " It would thus appear that the greywacke, approaching 
very near in qualities to the primitive mountain soil, is the best qualified to 
grow larch." The author is of opinion that, " when mineralogy, a science so 
interesting to the philosopher, comes to be more generally understood and 
applied to the discovery of useful mineral substances, we may expect that 
this tract will furnish products not yet brought to light, which may con- 
tribute to promote agricultural and manufacturing industry ; and the valley 
of the Nith, though not the most extensive, may become one of the most 
important that is anywhere to be met with in Scotland."

This is one of the most prosperous provincial societies in the kingdom ;

men whose active pursuits allow them little leisure for reading, it must

"to 



be the cause of much good, by directing their attention to those subjects 
by which they can best render service to science. The effects in this 
way are obvious, from the great number of donations annually made to 
the museum by naval officers. " In these commercial and maritime towns, 
the number of individuals possessed of literary leisure is necessarily limited. 
Hence the greater importance of facilitating their improvement ; of com- 
municating knowledge in an attractive form, whereby the mind is imper- 
ceptibly led to the acquisition of knowledge ; of divesting science of many 
of those technicalities which frequently prove insuperable difficulties to 
the student. The members of this Society are generally impressed with 
its usefulness ; and, if this Report should happen to circulate beyond our 
own immediate sphere, it is trusted that it may have some effect in exciting 
the uninterested, and arousing the lukewarm, in the cause of science. This 
Society does not advocate the interest of any sect ; it proceeds on the broad 
principle of doing good, not to particular individuals, but to the public at 
large ; not to any party, but to the inhabitants of these towns in general." 
The Report of the Committee from which these extracts are taken, is 
followed by the Secretary's Report, in which the analysis is given of the 
different lectures delivered throughout the year. The interest of these 
lectures, and the good which they are likely to effect, will appear from the 
following enumeration of the subjects of them : — Natural Philosophy, by 
Mr. John Fincham, Vice-President ; Geology of the Island of Portsea, by 
Lieut. Davies, Curator of the Museum ; Stenography, by Mr. Hinton, of 
Chichester; Mechanical Properties of the Atmosphere, by the Rev. J. Ful- 
lagar. President of the Mechanics* Institution of Chichester; Habits and 
Physiology of some of the Fermes Testacea, by Mr. C. Wilcox ; Forensic 
or State Medicine, by Mr. J. W. Williams ; Oxygen and hydrogen gases, by 
Mr, Richard Dowle ; Mineralogy, by Mr. William Fricker ; Philosophy of 
Evidence, by Mr. N. Griffin ; Physiology of the Stomach, and the Process 
of Digestion, by Mr. Garrington ; Authenticity of the Poems of Ossian, by 
the Rev. Edmund Kell, A.M., of Newport; Progress of Literature in Eng- 
land, since the invasion of Julius Caesar, by Mr. George Caught; Ichthy6- 
lites, or Fossil Remains of Fishes, by Lieut. J. H Davies, Curator of the 
Museum ; Languages, by Mr. Hinton, of Chichester; Anatomy and Physio- 
logy, by Mr. Julian Slight, Secretary ; Hydrostatics, by the Rev. J. Neave; 
Contagion, by Mr. J. W. Williams ; Magnetism, by Mr. Bennett, of Ports- 
mouth Dock-yard ; Probable permanency of Modern Civilisation, by Mr.

This is, in all respects, an original book ; the remarks are, for the greater 
part, confined to subjects of natural history ; and, mixed up as they are with 
the author's personal adventures, are not less entertaining than instructive. 
The future pages of our Collectanea will be richly indebted to Mr. Water- 
ton. What is particularly gratifying in reading the work, is the liberality 
and benevolent feeling which it displays, not only towards man in every 
country and clime, and of every religion and government, but towards 
every living thing capable of feeling pain or enjoying pleasure. The book 
deserves to be put into the hands of all boys resident in the country, to 
teach them the exercise of humanity, in their earlier years, towards insects 
and birds, and, in their more mature days, in the sports of the field and in 
the chase. We cannot sufficiently recommend it.

Before the appearance of this little tract, we were not aware that so 
much of this ancient amusement of our princes still remained in the king- 
dom. In the Olden time a falconer was an indispensable personage in 
the establishment of a nobleman ; but the invention of gunpowder, and 
improved machines of destruction, have almost banished the falconer, 
together with his occupation. The little work before us will, however, in 
some degree, retrieve the sinking fame of this once fashionable amusement, 
as it shows that training birds of prey for sport or use is perfectly practi- 
cable, and that, as instruments of the chase, they are as effectual, and, at 
the same time, just as rational, as the slaughtering gun, and certainly less 
dangerous. 

Sir John informs us that professional falconers have been for many 
years natives of the village of Falconsward, near Bois le Due, in Holland. 
A race of them was there born and bred, whence supplies have been 
drawn for the service of all Europe : but, as there has been no sufficient 
inducement for the young men to follow the employment of their fore- 
fathers, numbei*5 are dead or worn out ; and there only remains John Pells, 
now in the service of iiAkn Dawson Downes, Esq., of Old Gunton Hill, 
Suffolk. 

The author has very accurately detailed the best method of taking, 
rearing, and training the hunting hawks, with all the terms of falconry, 
including feeding, tiring, &c. ; and also given concise descriptions of their 
game, and directions for using them in the pursuit of it. 

The hawks enumerated by Sir John, which have been trained for the 
field, are the slight falcon (Falco gentilis) and the goshawk (Falco palum- 
barius}, which are the species generally used in falconry. The former is 
called a lon»-winged hawk, or one of the lure ; the latter a short-winged 
hawk, or one of the^jr^ 

The Icelander is the largest hawk that is known, and highly esteemed 
by falconers, especially for its great powers and tractable disposition. The 
gjT falcon is less than the Icelander, but much larger than the slight fidcon. 
These powerful birds are flown at herons and hares, and are the only 
hawks that are fully a match for the fork-tailed kite. The merlin and 
hobby are both small hawks, and fit only for sm.ill birds, as the blackbird, 
&.C. The sparrow-hawk (Falco A''isus) may be also trained to hunt : his 
flight is rapid for a short distance, kills partridges well in the early season, 
and is the best of all for landrails. 

Partridge, magpie, heron, and rook hawking are described, and in a way 
which must be interesting to every sportsman. 

Sir John asserts, that " the slight falcon takes up his abode every year, 
from October and November until the spring, upon Westminster Abbey, 
and other churches in the metropolis. This is well known to the Loudon 
pigeon-fanciers, from the great havoc they make in their flights.'* 

The fork-tailed kites were much flown, some years ago, by the Earl of 
Orford, in the neighbourhood of Aiconbury Hill.

Art. L The General Subject. 

Test of a good Naturalist. — It was the opinion of Linnaeus, that the 
superiority of a naturalist depends upon his knowledge of the greatest num- 
ber of species ; and, considering the character of his works, as filled with 
brief, dry, technical descriptions of genera and species, arranged in artificial, 
unnatural groups, somewhat after the fashion of an index, the opinion is 
not much to be wondered at, though few naturalists, we think, of the pre- 
sent day would covet the distinction, apart from other qualifications of a 
higher order. A good gossiping naturalist might, no doubt, be made, by 
storing the memory with Linnasan names and distinctions; but, by making 
these the chief study, all comprehensive and philosophical views of nature 
would be frittered down mto an endless and useless crowd of unarranged 
ideas, like the disunited and scattered links of what ought to form a 
beautiful and magnificent chain. It is indeed one of the most prominent 
marks of a vulgar and uneducated mind, to associate ideas slenderly con- 
nected, and to be deficient in the power of grouping important facts, and of 
bringing them into a luminous focus, as must be always the case with a jno-e 
knower of species. I cannot better illustrate the character of such gossiping 
naturalists, than by quoting Dame Quickly's speech to Sir John Falstafij in 
Henry IF., which is full of circumstances quite irrelevant and unconnected. 

" Hostess. Thou didst swear to me upon a parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in 
my Dolphin chamber, at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon the Wed- 
nesday in Whitsun-week, when the prince broke thy head for likening his 
father to a singing-man of Windsor; then didst thou swear to me, then, as I 
was washing thy wound, to marry me, and make me my lady thy wife. 
Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher's wife, come in 
then, and call me gossip Quickly, — coming in to borrow a mess of vinegar; 
telling us she had a good dish of prawns ; whereby thou didst desire to eat 
some; whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound? And didst 
not thou, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more so fami- 
liarity with such poor people ?" 

My test of a good naturalist, on the contrary, would be taken from the 
power of combining a number of important facts into connected groups, so 
as to establish useful general conclusions. A short example of what I mean 
will be found in the extract from Wilson, respecting feline animals (p. 571.). 
— J. Rennie. 

Technicalities of Science. — The inutility of science, written in a merely 
technical form, is well exemplified in the instance of Cicero. He was ad- 
vised by his friends not to write his works on Greek Philosophy in Latin ; 
because those who cared for it would prefer his work in Greek, and those 
who did not would read neither Greek nor Latin. The splendid success of 
his De Officiisy his De Finibus, his De Natura Deorum, &c., showed that 
his friends were wrong. He persevered in the popular style, and led the 
fashion. — Id.

370 The General StibjecL 

Devotion to Nature, — The Headland of Tarbet, which seemed " so 
threatening overnight, now most desirably cuts us off from every connec- 
tion with the low land. Nature, always lovely in detail, was now sublime 
in her tout ensevible. Every thing about us proclaimed a power which 
penetrated to the very centre of our being. Nature was here every thing, 
man nothing, except as he was filled with the grandeur and wonders of 
nature. The curtain of the world seemed withdrawn ; and, without any 
formality of worship, our hearts paid a grateful homage to the Great 
Architect who had prepared such a magnificent spectacle." {Letters from 
the Highlands^ hy W., in Scotsmariy April 16.) 

Class'ification. — First thoughts on most subjects are often right, because 
they are the impulse of natural feeling ; succeeding thoughts are exercises 
of reason, and are sometimes right and sometimes wrong. For a while man 
is best pleased with his own systems, because he understands them best ; 
afterwards he begins to discover something of the system of nature, and 
ultimately he returns to his first feelings, and endeavours to cultivate them. 
Thus, in the study of botany and zoology, the early authors arranged plants 
and animals according to their more obvious appearances and resemblances; 
afterwards they had recourse to particular parts of individuals, as the flowers, 
leaves, &c., of plants, and the teeth, feet, &c., of animals. After a great 
number of such artificial systems have been tried, modern botanists and 
zoologists have adopted what is called the natural system, or classification 
according to the aggregate of resemblances, which is nothing more than a 
return to the manner of looking at objects, and classing them, adopted 
instinctively by every human being. — C. N. 

The Study of Natural History. — There are few studies better calculated 
to expand the mind, and gratify our natural thirst of knowledge. The gra- 
dation and inter-approximation of animal forms, amid whose countless vari- 
ations a relation to a given standard can be traced, to one common and 
original type; the intimate relation between organised beings and the 
local circumstances by which they are surrounded ; the structure of pecu- 
liar organs which necessitate a modification of all the others, and fix irre- 
versibly the habits and mode of existence of the animal; the varieties 
produced by accidental causes, and the grand and permanent distinctions, 
whose preservation has been guarded by jealous nature with impassable 
barriers ; the proportionate developement of the intellectual principle 
following the varieties of organisation ; and, in fine, the astonishing re- 
sults of that mysterious cause, which our ignorance has termed instinct : 
all these are surely subjects of the highest interest, and constitute the essen- 
tial province and peculiar charm of zoology. The writers who unfold them 
are deserving of the gratitude and admiration of mankind, as much as those 
who employ themselves in disguising and degrading the science, by a caco- 
phonous nomenclature, and a parade of barbarous Latinity which fools think 
learning, are entitled to reprobation and contempt. There are many such 
in France, and some among ourselves, great men in their little circles ; they 
do well to make the most of this ; for they may rest assured, that however 
highly they may rank in their own estimation, or in that of their coteries, 
the world neither knows nor cares any thing about them. {Athenceum, 
April 8. p. 341.) 

Spontaneous Organisation of Matter. — We have before (p. 6S.) stated 
the opinion of M. Bory on this subject. M. Dutrochet has endeavoured to 
show that the green matter floating about in stagnant waters, as well as the 
microscopical animalcula found in water in the summer season, is nothing 
more than gelatinous matter, altogether inanimate, but influenced by electri- 
cal currents. With respect to the green matter, J. Rennie, in the Vcrulam, 
says, " we are certain of the fact, that the green matter which forms on 
stagnant water is precisely the same with that which forms on walls of 
stone, brick, or cement ; and that it is not related to Byssi and Conf^rvae 



Zoology, 371 

any more than to animalcula, but is simply the germination of the more 
common mosses (Tortulae, i^jpna, Poljtricha, &c.), which, for want of 
proper soil to support their vegetation, never get beyond what is in them 
analogous to the seed-leaf in cotyledonous plants."

Musical Ear. — " I knew, at Paris, the widow of an Irish patriot, who 
could not hear the * Exile of Erin ' sung, without being overpowered to such 
a degree, that it would have been truly alarming, had not a flood of tears 
come to her relief. What is wonderful, so far from having a fine musical 
ear, she had not even a commonplace relish for music. The same effect 
was produced on her by the * Minstrel Boy ' of Moore. P., a young friend 
of the writer, who has no taste for music, is similarly overpowered, even in 
a crowded theatre, when * Home, sweet Home ' is sung." {London Maga- 
zine.) 

Characteristics of Feline ^mma/5. — Animals of the cat kind are, in a state 
of nature, almost continually in action both by night and by day. They either 
walk, creep, or advance rapidly by prodigious bounds ; but they seldom rM«, 
owing, it is believed, to the extreme flexibility of their limbs and vertebral 
column, which cannot preserve the rigidity necessary to that species of 
movement. Their sense of sight, especially during twilight, is acute ; their 
hearing very perfect, and their perception of smell less so than in the 
dog tribe. Their most obtuse sense is that of taste ; the lingual nerve in 
the lion, according to Des Moulins, being no larger than that of a middle- 
sized dog. In fact, the tongue of these animals is as much an organ ot 
mastication as of taste ; its sharp and horny points, inclined backwards, 
being used for tearing away the softer parts of the animal substances on 
which they prey. The perception of touch is said to reside very delicately 
in the small bulbs at the base of the mustachios. {WUson\ Illustrations of 
Zoology.) 

Food of the Humming-Bird. — From the circumstance of humming-birds 
frequenting flowers, and thrusting their needle-formed bills into the blos- 
soms, as bees and butterflies do their suckers (haustella), it has hastily been 
concluded by naturalists, that, like these insects, they feed on honey. But 
if such naturalists had paused for a moment to consider the form of the 
bill and the tongue in the jTrochilidae, their conclusions would not perhaps 
have been so hasty. The trophi of insects which feed on the honey of 
flowers, are beautifully adapted for procuring it by suction, which is com- 
monly indispensable, the honey being in most cases spread thinly over the 
surface of the nectary or the ungulae of the petals, and not in quantities such 
as it might be drank like water. Now it is a fact, which is or may be well 
known, that birds have almost no power of suction, in consequence of the 
narrowness and rigidity of their tongue, as may be seen when they drink, 
having to hold up their heads and depend upon the weight of the water 
for transmitting it into the craw. Nobody, as far as we know, has described 
the humming-bird drinking the honey from flowers in this manner, and in- 
deed its tenacity and glutinous nature would entirely preclude this. Such 
reasons would dispose us, therefore, to conclude, that the Trochilidae do not 
feed on honey, though we did not possess irresistible proofs of the fact, that 
they feed on insects. 

Wilson, the distinguished author of the American Ornithology^ found, 
upon repeated dissection, that the T'rochilus colubris had a quantity of 
insects in its stomach, either whole or in fragments ; and the eccentric 
Waterton affirms that humming-birds feed on insects. Of course, they

frequent flowers not for their honey, but to prey upon the insects which 
are in pursuit of this honey. Were the requisite scrutiny gone into, it is 
probable that we should find all Latham's " Flower-eaters " (Anthophagi) 
and Temminck*s Nectarlniae exclusively feeding on insects. — J, Jiennie. 

Mechanism of the Keck in Birds. — The contrivance by which the spine of 
animals is rendered susceptible of varied motion, is by means of a strong chain 
of bones (vertebrae), locked together by means of knobs and projections to 
prevent dislocation, a chain which stretches from the head to the extre- 
mity of the tail. Every body must have remarked, that in birds the neck 
is more capable of varied motion than in quadrupeds ; but it is not so com- 
monly known, that this can be accounted for from the greater number of 
bones, and consequently, of joints, in the necks of birds. Except in the 
three-toed sloth, indeed, the bones in the neck of quadrupeds and of man are 
uniformly seven in number, the short-necked mole havmg the same as the 
long-necked giraffe ; in birds, the number is never less than nine, and va- 
ries from that to twenty-four : facts, which, we. think, are as interesting as 
they are curious. — Id> 

Varieties of Trout. — The late Professor Jurine, in his interesting History 
of the Fishes of the Lake of Geneva^ has attempted to show that what are 
reckoned different species or varieties of trout (^Salmo Trutta and S. i^io), 
and known under various names, such as the common trout, the salmon trout, 
the lake trout, the river trout, the Alpine trout, &c.;are all referable to differ- 
ence of sex, age, season, the nature of the waters, food, light, &c. The dis- 
tinctive marks taken from the prolongation of the under jaw beyond the 
upper, the colour of the flesb, of the skin, with the size and shade of the 
spots, the form of the tail, &c., he found not to be permanent, and there- 
fore not to be depended upon. (Menu de la Soc. de Physique etd'HisU Nat. 
de Geneve.) 

Migration of Fish. — The beluga (Accip^nser HusoX though an inhabitant 
of the Black Sea, is often caught at Presburg, 500 German miles from the 
mouth of the Danube. What shows that the migration is not solely for 
spawning is, that at the migrating season rivers abound in shoals of young 
fish incapable of spawning. May it not be, that the beluga swims against 
the stream to free itself from animalcula infesting the head ? {Tauio Bes^ 
chreibung von Slavonien, i. 29.) The salmon. Pennant tells us, is obliged to 
Quit the sea to rid himself of the Lemae'ae ^almoneae L. ; and Dr. An- 
derson says they are driven back from the fresh water by another species 
of vermin. 

Alligators swaUounng Stones. — It is well known that many species of 
birds swallow small stones, for the purpose, as is supposed, of aiding diges- 
tion ; but it is, we believe, an anomaJy amongst other orders of animals. 
The following notice, accordingly, struck us as singular, if not incredible. 
The Indians on the banks of the Oronoko assert ^that, previously to an alli- 
gator going in search of prey, it always swallows a large stone, that it may 
acquire additional weight to aid it in diving and dragging its victims under 
water. The author being somewhat incredulous upon this point (how 
could he be otherwise ?), Bolivar, to convince him, shot several with his 
rifle, and in all of them were found stones, varying in weight according to 
the size of the animal. The largest killed was about 17 it. in length, and 
had within him a stone weighing about 60 or 70 lbs. The author, however, 
still remains sceptical (very properly, we think), and has some doubts whe- 
ther these stones are not calculi secreted in the stomach ! ! ! (See Recol- 
lection* of Venezuela and Colo7)ibia, by an Officer of th* Colombian Navy.) 

Charming of Serpents. — Stedman, in his Expedition to Surinam, describes 
certain sibyls among the negroes, who, together with other singular prac- 
tices, can charm or conjure down from trees certain species of serpents, 
which will wreathe about the arms, neck, and breast of the pretended sor- 
ceress, listening to her voice j and nothing, as he adds, is more notorious, 



Zoology, 373 

than that the eastern Indians will rid their houses of the most venomous 
snakes, by charming them with the sound of a flute, which calls them out 
of their holes. Instances of the same kind, however incredible they may 
appear, are given, not only by ancient writers, such as Pliny and Seneca, but 
by modern authors of undoubted credit, such as Sir William Jones, Bruce, 
Shaw, Greaves, Chardin, Forbes, and Chateaubriand. 

Eyes of Crabs and Lobsters. — Dr. W. E. Leach has invented a term (Po- 
dophthalma) to distinguish crustaceous animals, from the mechanism of 
their eyes, which are placed at the extremity of pedicles, somewhat like 
the glass of a telescope. M. Lamarck says that these eyes are not retrac- 
tile, like the horns of the snail, but he has observed, in living crabs and lob- 
sters, that the eyes, at the least touch, are drawn back a little into the 
sheath, and concealed in the same /owe/^e where they are placed. {La- 
marck, Discours d^ Ouverture,p. 15.) 

The Tyrian Purple Dye. — The colour extracted by the ancients from 
certain shellfish, and so highly esteemed, as to be reserved exclusively for 
princes, has been produced by modern experiment, though its value, it 
should seem, has passed away with the fashions of antiquity. More than 
one sort of shellfish furnishes a purple dye, but the principal belong to the 
two genera ilfurex and jBuccinum, which can still be procured in great 
plenty on the shores of the Mediterranean. The great expense of the pro- 
cess would preclude it, we imagine, from answering the purpose of modern 
speculation, for one shell only affords a single drop of the dye; and it re- 
quired (at least in the ancient process) six pounds of dye to one pound of 
wool, which, when dyed, sold at the enormous price of a thousand Roman 
denarii, or about Z6l. 

Hatching of Female Eggs. — It has long been remarked, by collectors,' 
that the male broods of insects always appear earlier than the female 
broods ; but we do not know whether it has also been remarked, that the 
eggs from which females are produced are longer in hatching. I can state 
one instance in which this was distinctly the case. Upon the leaf of a 
poplar tree I found three eggs of the Puss moth (Cerura vlnula), two of 
which were hatched about two weeks before the other. The first were 
males, the last a female. As they were on the same leaf, and presumed, of 
course, to be laid by the same parent, at the same time, the difTerence of 
hatching could not arise from difference of weather, exposure, &c. — 
J. Rennie. 

Doubtful Discoveries. — It may serve, in some measure, to confirm M. 
Dutrochet's recent opinion of the non-existence of miscrosoopic animal- 
cula, that the celebrated Spallanzani persuaded himself that he could see 
Animalcula infusoria which could be seen by nobody else. He attributed 
his own superiority of vision, in this respect, to long practice in using the 
microscope. The philosopher exulted in his enviable distinction, when a 
peasant, to whom he showed his animalcula, could perceive nothing but 
muddy water. 

Mistakes of Instinct. — In the account of that most singular parasitic 
flower (having neither leaves nor stem, it can scarcely be called a plant), the 
Rafilesm Arnoldw {Mag. of Nat. Hist., p. 68.), it is mentioned that it smells 
like tainted beef; and, on its first discovery by Dr. Arnold, a swarm of flies 
were gathered round it, for the purpose, he imagined, of depositing their 
eggs upon it, supposing it, no doubt, to be in reality tainted beef. This is 
one instance in hundreds which might be enumerated, of what may be called 
the mistakes of instinct, where it depends upon the information of the senses; 
and, in this respect, similar mistakes frequently occur, where the higher 
powers of human rationality are deceived by analogous phenomena. The fine 
nutty flavour of cherry laurel-water and of prussic acid, both most deadly 
poisons, would be certain to deceive the inexperienced ; and Majendie*s 
maid-servant actually fell an immediate victim to her desire of tasting the 

c c 3 . 



874 Zoology. 

prussic acid which she found in his laborator}'. It is needless, however, to 
waste words in illustrating human mistakes of this kind, as it is an article 
of popular belief, and supposed to arise from the artificial habits acquired 
in social life; whereas, the same popular creed would have us believe that 
wild animals never mistake poison for food, and that their instinct is infal- 
lible. 

How universally soever this doctrine may be believed, there can be no 
doubt that it is founded in error ; for, as 1 have said, numerous instances 
could be given of the mistakes of instinct. I shall content myself with men- 
tioning one or two. 

The common earthworm (Lumbricus terr^stris) is instinctively afraid of 
moles ; and, no sooner does it hear any subterranean noise, or feel any 
tremblement de terrcy similar to those indicative of the approaching move- 
ments of its enemy, than it makes a speedy escape to the surface. Every 
boy knows how to take advantage of this, to procure fish-baits, by thrusting 
a spade or a stake into the ground, and moving it backwards and forwards, 
to imitate the advance of a burrowing mole in search of prey. The worm, 
unable, with all its instinct, to discriminate between its subterranean enemy 
and the spade, darts into daylight, and is instantly captured for the boy*s 
bait-bag. The lapwing (Trlnga Van^llus), it is said, is aware of this instinctive 
fear of the earthworm of subterranean concussions or noises; and, when 
it cannot find sufficiency of slugs, &c., above ground, it pats the ground with 
its feet, till the earth-worms, mistaking it for an advancing mole, come 
forth to be feasted upon. I cannot, on my own knowledge, vouch for the 
authenticity of this ingenious device in the lapwing ; it is stated, however, a» 
a fact, by Dr. Anderson, in his Bee. 

It is well known that, whenever a hawk appears, he is immediately sur- 
rounded by a host of small birds, particularly swallows, which dart at him 
and tease him, for the purpose, as it is supposed, of distracting his attention, 
on the principle that " Wealth makes wit waver." Be this as it may, the 
cuckoo, which bears a strong resemblance to the hawk when on the wing, 
is certain of a similar retinue of small birds wherever it flies. In the north, 
this is so commonly observed, that the cuckoo is vulgarly believed to be 
always attended by a titlhig or pippet (Jlauda minor, or A. pratdnsis Linn.), 
which, it is further imagined, has been its stepmother and nurse from the 
egg. This, indeed, is the bird whose nest the cuckoo most frequently selects 
to deposit the eggs which she so strangely and unnaturally abandons ; though 
it is not on this account, but because she appears to be a hawk, that the 
pippet and other small birds persecute her. 

An instance similar to that of the flies mistaking the Rafflesia for beef 
occurs in our country, where the common flesh-fly (ikfusca vomitoria) lays its 
eggs in the fetid sorts of Phalli and -^garici, apparently under the notion 
that these are genuine carrion. 

If I may be allowed an example from domesticated animals, Linnaeus 
records, in his Lachesis LapvonicOy that, at Tornea, there is a meadow or bog 
full of water-hemlock (Cicuta virosa), which annually destroys from fifty to 
a hundred head of cattle. It seems that they eat most of it in spring, when 
first turned into the pasture, partly from their eagerness for fresh pasture, 
and partly from their long fasting and greediness, the herbage being then 
short. Besides, from the immersion of the hemlock under water, it may 
not have the proper scent to deter them. A similar destruction of cattle 
from the same cause, occurs in the wide meadows of Leinings. — J. Bennie. 

The Hawfinch's Nest. — On the 14th of May last, the nest of a hawfinch 
(Fringilla C'occothraustes Tcmm.) was taken in an orchard belonging to Mr. 
Waring, at Chelsfield, Kent. I have seen the nest and eggs, and also the 
old female bird, which was shot on the nest. As the nest differs from the 
descriptions of the naturalists whose works I have referred to, and as, I 
believe, it is only within the last few years that the hawfinch has been 



Zoologij. S15 

known to breed in this country, a particular account of the nest and eggs 
may be acceptable to ornithologists. The nest has been described to be of 
beautiful construction, and built in the upper branches of trees ; whereas, ' 
the one just mentioned was of a slovenly loose form, and shallow, not 
being so deep as those of the greenfinch or linnet, and was placed against a 
large bough of an apple tree, about 10 ft. from the ground. It was com- 
posed externally of dead twigs and a few roots, next with coarse white moss 
or lichen, and lined with horsehair and a little fine dried grass. The eggs 
were five in number, about the size of a skylark's, but shorter and rounder, 
of a dull greenish-grey, irregularly streaked, and spotted with bluish-ash and 
olive-brown, some of the spots inclining to dusky or blackish-brown ; the 
markings were variously distributed on the different eggs. — T. F. Londofi, 
June 23. 

National Distinctions. —In the Hice and Cry of Jan. 22., a list of 102 
deserters is advertised. Of these there are, — English, 34 ; Irish, 32 ; Scotch, 
16. Of the 16 Scotch, 6 have long necks; of the 52 Irish, 12 have long 
necks ; of the 34 English, 7 have long necks. Most of the Irish are de- 
scribed as having short necks. These are described as having large and 
wide mouths: English, 3; Irish, 19; Scotch, none. Nearly all the long- 
necked Scotch are weavers and spinners. The chief peculiarities appearing 
in the list are, that the Irish have as frequently blue eyes as grey or hazel, 
while the blue eyes, among the English and Scotch, are to the grey, as one 
to six ; that the Irish monopolise all the wide mouths ; that there are more 
fair-haired men among the Scotch than among the Irish, and more among 
the Irish than among the English. ( Tlimei, January 25.) 

The Spider of Solomon. (Prov. xxx. 25.) — The learned Dr. Scott of Cor- 
storphine, in a paper read before the Wernerian Natural History Society 
of Edinbm'gh, and since published in Professor Jameson's JoMr^a/, has gone 
far to prove that the word translated spider should have been translated 
lizard. Lizards of all kinds are very numerous in Syria. Bruce saw in one 
day many thousands of them, in the great court of the Temple of the Sun 
at Balbec. The ground, the walls, and the stones were covered with them; 
and the various colours of which they consisted, made a very extraordinary 
appearance, glittering in the sun, in which they lay sleeping and basking. 
Arabia is full of lizards ; and, wherever a tent is pitched or a house reared, 
the Arabs are infested with their presence. Solomon's spider is said to take 
hold with its hands, while in kings' palaces ; the hind, but especially the 
fore, feet of the lizard very much resemble the arms and hands of a man. 
Hence, the tribe of animals to which this family belongs are called jLacertae, 
i. e. creatures with arms or hands. Supposing the spider of Solomon {Sema- 
mith in the original Hebrew) to be a lizard, it is most consistently said to 
take hold with its arms or hands, in moving from one place to another, that 
it may catch flies, which are its ordinary food, elude the pursuit of its 
enemies, when it moves along places which they cannot reach, or secure its 
safety if its back be undermost. In these respects it was natural for him to 
admire its dexterity, and declare that it discovered great wisdom, though it 
was little on the earth. {Scott in Jam. Phil. Jour., Dec. 1 827, p. 35.) 

A Canary Bird fed hy a Sparrow — You may, perhaps, Mr. Editor, have 
read an observation of Mr. Hunt's, in his charming little periodical. The 
Companion, that the same things have been acting over and over again since 
the beginning of the world, with only slight alterations as to time, namp, 
and locality ; an observation which, I think, I can also illustrate myself, if 
you will permit nle to give you the history of the benevolent Howard, acted 
over again, about a dozen years ago, by so very humble an individual as a 
house sparrow. 

The late Mrs. O'Brien, of Manor Place, Chelsea, was extremely fond of 
birds, of which she kept a considerable number in cages, for her amuse- 
ment. Among others she had a canary, who was a particular favourite 

c c 4 



376 Tjoology. 

but the loudness of his note often obliged her to put him outside of the 
window, among some trees which were trained up in front of the house. 
One morning during breakfost, when the cage was thus placed, a sparrow 
was observed to fly round and around it, to stand upon the top, and to 
twitter to the bird within, between whom and itself a species of reciprocal 
conversation at length began to ensue. After a few moments he flew away, 
but returned in a short time, bearing a worm * in his bill, which he dropped 
into the cage, and again flew away. Similar presents were received day 
after day, at the same time, by the canary, from his generous friend the 
sparrow, with whom he at length became so intimate, that he very often 
received the food thus brought, into his own bill, from that of the sparrow. 
An affair so curious and interesting had, I assure you, often many spectators; 
and some of the neiglibours, to try the extent of the sparrow*s benevolence, 
also hung their birds out at the window, when, curious to relate, they found 
them also fed ; but the first and longest visit was always paid by the sparrow 
to his earliest acquaintance. 

Though thus intimate and social with his own kind, as his historian I must 
not forget to observe that this sparrow was extremely shy and timid with 
respect to human beings ; for, though many were witnesses of what I have 
related, they were still obliged to observe at a distance, and in silence, 
otherwise he instantly flew away. Whether this arose from a feeling of 
injury that he had received from any of our species, I cannot say; though, most 
probably, he had been robbed of his young by some mischievous boy,or other- 
wise he could not have had so much time to devote to strangers. The sum- 
mer, however, passed away, and autumn's many-coloured foliage was already 
scattered by the breath of winter, ere the sparrow ceased to visit his captive 
friends. But at length it was observed that one day the benevolent bird 
came not, that another and another still passed away with the same omis- 
sion, and, in fine, that he came not again ! I wish that I could add to the 
interest and sublimity of my tale, by finishing it with an affecting description 
of the deaths of at least some of the captive birds ; but truth forbids the re- 
lation, and such only, Mr. Editor, will be at any time offered to you by your 
correspondent, — C. 

Introduction of Foreign Birds, — Every one who admires the music of 
the groves, and who resides in a country too far north to be visited by 
the nightingale, regrets the absence of that far-famed bird. It is believed 
by those who have studied the habits of our migratory songsters, that both 
old and young ones return to their old haunts in the breeding season. 
Hence it has been suggested that, if any of these annual visitants were bred 
beyond the ordinary limits of their accustomed place of nidification, the 
young, perhaps, would return to the same place in the following season. 

Relying on this as a means of introducing the nightingale to the northern 
parts of the island, Sir John Sinclair commissioned the late Mr. Dickson, of 
Covent Garden, to buy for him as many nightingales* eggs, at a shilling each, 
as he could procure. This was done accordingly ; the eggs were carefully 
packed in wool, and sent to Sir John by the mail. 

In the mean time, the Baronet had employed men to find and take care 
of several nests of the robin-redbreast, in places where they might iiatch 
in security. The eggs of the robins were exchanged for those of the night- 
ingales, were sat upon, hatched, and brought up by their foster-parents, f 
The young nightingales flew at the usual time, were seen for some time 
afterwards, emigrated, it was supposed, at the usual period (September), but 
never returned to the place of their birth. 

* I question the fact of a canary eating worms at all. — J, R. 
t Redbreasts readily forsake their own eggs, when they are touched. 
How did they relish the foreign ones ? — J. It. 



Zoology. 377 

Mr. Anderson, of the Chelsea botanic garden, who has furnished this 
account, thinks that this trial was not a fair one, because their translocation 
should be gradual, progressing farther and farther north, in succeeding 
years ; and, were such a method practicable, he thinks it might succeed in 
course of time, being persuaded, from what he has noticed of this bij*d, that 
they choose their breeding-place as much from convenience, as from any 
constitutional delicacy compelling them to fear either the want of warmth 
or want of food. Mr. Anderson adds that he has had nightingales' eggs 
hatched by redbreasts, in the Chelsea garden ; and thinks that some of the 
young returned the following year, but were soon caught by the vagrant 
birdcatchers in the neighbouring gardens. The unfledged nightingales, he 
observes, are also, more than other birds near towns, liable to be destroyed 
by cats, from their noisy clamour for food, as soon as it is light in the morn- 
mg, and thus calling the cat to their nest. No bird is so easily caught by a 
trap as the nightingale ; and great numbers of them are so taken every year 
in the neighbourhood of London, a practice much condemned by the inha- 
bitants of the surrounding villas. 

To this account we have only to add, that we think Mr. Sweet's manner 
of keeping and breeding tame birds, would sooner furnish a supply of wild 
ones than any other mode. 

Negroes. — Blumenbach gives a most entertaining account of a little 
library which he possesses of works written by negroes, from which it ap- 
pears, that there is not a single department of taste or science, in which 
some negro has not distinguished himself. {Scotsman^ Dec. 29.) 

Faculties of Brutes. — The dog is the only animal that dreams ; and he 
and the elephant the only animals that understand looks ; the elephant is 
the only animal that, besides man, feels ennui; the dog, the only quadruped 
that has been brought to speak. Leibnitz bears witness to a hound in 
Saxony, that could speak distinctly thirty words. {Medical Gazette.) 

Men and Plants are equally under the Infiuence of Climate. — Where the 
spruce and Scotch pines and where bushes will not succeed, the nature of 
man seems equally defective. He sinks in the struggle with necessity and 
the climate. — {Von Buch^ s Lapland.) 

The Marmot (ilfus Marmota Lin.). 1^0 

{Jig. 1 70.) — These beasts, in the strict- 
est sense, make hay ; they bite off 
the grass, turn it, and dry it in the 
sun. It is reported that they use an 
old she marmot as a cart. She lies 
on her back, the hay is heaped on 
her belly, and two others drag her 
home. {London Medical Gazette.) 
The Alpine marmot, or mountain- 
mouse, inhabits the highest summits of 
the Alps and Pyrenean mountains, in 
dry places without trees. It is social, living in societies of from five to four- 
teen, who, when basking in the sun, place a sentinel in advance, who 
whistles on the approach of danger, when the marmots retire into their 
holes. These holes are lined with moss and dry grass. About the end of 
September they retire into them, and stop up the entrance with earth, and 
there they remain in a torpid state till March. They are generally taken 
by digging out during winter. Their flesh is tender and delicate, their 
skins valuable, and the Savoyards esteem their fat medicinal. They live on 
insects, roots, and vegetables, and are fond of milk. The Savoyards expose 
them as shows in various parts of Europe. Even in a warm climate, they 
are said to fall into a state of torpidity in winter. 

Curious Duck. — Sir, Your Prospectus encourages me to send you a 
trifle, which you may perhaps find room for in your « collection of facts." 




S78 Botany, 

In the neighbourhood of this place is a domestic duck, which flies with the 
same power and at the same neight as a crow ; or rather, I should say, in 
the same way as if it was wild. I saw him crossing the road yesterday, and 
for some time was lost in wonder at what strange bird it could be. The 
people, of the village, however, soon answered my enquiry, and^^assured me 
this duck would often make the circuit of a mile. The weakness of flight 
in domesticated birds is, no doubt, occasioned by the little or no use that 
is made of their wings. It would be curious to ascertain what first taught 
this duck to know that he could fly whenever he chose. On visiting my friend 
Mr. S. at Tittenhanger Green, the other day, I was again surprised at 
seeing a flock of fifteen or twenty geese get up and fly tolerably well for 
near four hundred yards, pass a hedge, and alight on the borders of a pond.

Experiments on Vegetation. — The celebrated chemist. Professor Dobe- 
reiner of Jena, has made the following experiments on the vegetation of 
seeds. Two glass vessels were procured, each of the capacity of 320 cubic 
inches, and two portions of barley were sown in parts of the same earth, and 
moistened in the same degree ; they were placed one in each vessel. The 
air was now exhausted in one, till reduced to the pressure of 14 in. of mer- 
cury ; and condensed in the other, till the pressure equalled S6 in. Germi- 
nation took place in both nearly at the same time, and the leafits appeared 
of the same green tint; but, at the end of 15 days, the following differ- 
ences existed: — The shoots in the rarefied air were 6 in. in length, and 
from 9 in. to 10 in. in the condensed air. The former were expanded, and 
soft ; the latter rolled round the stem, and solid. The former were wet on 
their surface, and especially towards the extremities; the latter were nearly 
dry. " I am disposed,*' says M. Dobereiner, " to believe that the diminution 
in the size of plants, as they rise into higher regions on mountains, depends 
more on the diminution of pressure than of heat. The phenomena of drops 
of water on the leaves, in the rarefied air, calls to my mind the relation of a 
young Englishman, who, whilst passing through Spanish America as a pri- 
soner, remarked that, on the highest mountains of the country, the trees 
continually transpired a quantity of water, even in the driest weather, the 
water falling sometimes like rain." {Bibliotheque Universelle.) 

O'rchis pyramidalis. — On Sunday, the 29th of June, 1828, was brought 
to me a specimen of the O'rchis pyramidalis, in which the flowers were des- 
titute of spur and lip. Each flower consisted of a calyx of three-coloured 
leaves, and a corolla of three petals, all quite uniform, and the organs of 
fructification (which were of the form proper to the genus) were placed in 
the centre — D. Stock. Bungay, July 28. 

. The Ivy-leaved Snapdragon, or Toadflax\Av\t\rr\{in\im cyrabalaria), is sup- 
posed by botanists not to be a native of this island. I found a considerable 
patch of it, in the end of May, on the lower part of a rock near Barmouth, 
North Wales. It was some distance from any house, and in a situation 
where it was not likely to have escaped from a garden. — T. F. June 23. 

Erodium cicutarium var. 3. is, I believe, the only English Erodium with 
any sort of figure on the petals. This has two, or more commonly three, 
of the petals stamped near the base with a snot of green, which is a consi- 
derable addition to its beauty. This summer I found an Erodium with these 
spotted petals, and answering to the characters of this species in every 
respect but the simple stamens. The filaments had a tooth near the base, 
on each side ; in that respect, and in the pale colour of the leaves, it corre- 



Botany, 379 

snonded with the E. marltimum : one of the stipulas was considerably broader 
than the other, and cleft about half way down ; a character of no great 
importance, but, such as it was, differing from both species. I mention the 
circumstance, because Sir J. E. Smith says expressly that the petals of E. 
maritimum are not spotted, and makes the following observation with 
regard to the stamens : — " Mr. Sowerby observed the 2ihovt\\Q filaments to 
be peculiarly broad, and the perfect ones to have a tooth at each side, near 
the base." This last mark would greatly strengthen the specific character 
if it should prove constant, which, in these organs, so various, if not mutable, 
in this natural order, cannot absolutely be relied on, unless confirmed by

Antirr/iinum Linaria. — Sir J. E. Smith says of the common yellow toadflax 
(JntirrhinuraLinaria), that flowers regularly five-cleft, with five spurs and five 
equal stamens (like the Swedish variety that was so near being exalted by Lin- 
naeus into a new genus), have been found on the same plant with flowers natu- 
rally formed. Such a plant is represented in English botany. He observes 
that the same alteration has been seen in other species, as A. repens, A. spu- 
rium, &c. Of this last, the flowers have been found with two, three, four, 
and five spurs, though not on the same plant. The whole genus having this 
tendency to disguise itself, it may not be thought very remarkable that the 
A. Linaria should be found with two spurs ; but some of your readers may 
be curious to see, or to possess a specimen of it, in this state. Near the 
end of June, I gathered a plant of this kind (of which all the flowers were 
formed in the same manner) from the hedge on the left-hand side of the 
road, on the ascent of the hill approaching Highgate, from the Spaniards, 
Hampstead. I left more there ; and, though it is now too late to seek it 
this year, it may probably be found there, in the same condition, next 
summer. — Id, 

ScUla nutans^ with the bracteas as long as the leaves, and coloured like the 
flowers. — I have in my possession a dried specimen of this description ; but, 
as I remember to have seen the same thing twice, it may not be an uncom- 
mon variety. — Id. 

Diffusion of Seeds in the Violet. — The various mechanical contrivances 
by which nature has enabled plants to diffuse their seeds, are matters of 
common observation ; but I have not met with any description, in works of 
botany, of the mechanism remarkable in the various species of violets. The 
seeds of this natural order of plants are contained in a capsule of a single 
loculament, consisting, however, of three valves. To the inner part of each of 
these valves the seeds are attached, and remain so for some time after the 
valves, in the process of ripening, have separated and stood open. The 
influence of the sun's heat, however, causes the sides of each valve to shrink 
and collapse, and in this state the edges press firmly upon the seed, which, 
from being before apparently irregular in its arrangement, comes into a 
straight line. The seeds, it may be remarked, are not only extremely 
smooth, polished, and shining, but regularly egg-shaped; so that, when 
pressed upon by the collapsing edge of the valve, it slides gradually down 
the sloping part of the seed, and throws it with a jerk to a considerable dis- 
tance. There is another part of the contrivance of nature, for the same 
purpose, in the Tiolaceae, worthy of remark. Before the seed is ripe, the 
capsule hangs in a drooping position, with the persisting calyx spread over it 
like an umbrella, to guard it from the rain and dews, which would retard the 
process of ripening ; but no sooner is the ripening completed, than the cap- 
sule becomes upright with the calyx for a support. This upright position 
appears to be intended by nature to give more effect to the valvular me- 
chanism for scattering the seeds, as it thus gains a higher elevation (in some 
cases more than an inch) from which to project them ; and this will give it, 
according to the laws of projectiles, a very considerable increase of horizon- 
tal extent. 



380 Botany, 

Some ripe capsules of a fine variety of Tiola tricolor, which I placed 
in a shallow pasteboard box, in a drawer, were found to have projected 
their seeds to the distance of nearly two feet. From the elevation of a 
capsule, therefore, at the top of a tall plant, I should think these seeds 
might be projected twice or thrice that distance. — J. Rennie. 

Organisation and Reproduction of the Truffle. — The truffle (Tuber 
cib^ium) is a vegetable entirely destitute of leafy appendages and of roots ; 
it is nothing more than a rounded subterraneous mass, absorbing nourish- 
ment upon every point of its surface, the reproduction of which is 
dependent upon bodies generated within its substance. The truffle is 
composed of globular vesicles, destined for the reproduction of the vege- 
table, and short and barren filaments, called, by M. Turpin, tigellides. 
The whole forms a substance at first white, but which becomes brown 
by age, with the exception of particular white veins. This change of 
colour is dependent upon the presence of the reproductive bodies, or 
trufinelles. Each globular vesicle is fitted to give birth, in its internal 
surface, to a multitude of these reproductive bodies ; but there are only 
a few of them which perfect the young vegetable. These dilate consider- 
ably, and produce internally other smaller vesicles, of which two, three, or 
four, increase in size, become brown, are beset with small points on their 
exterior surface, and fill the interior of the larger vesicles. The small 
masses thus formed are the trufinelles, and become truffles after the death 
of their parent. Thus, the brown parts of the truffle are those which con- 
tain the trufinelles ; and the interposed white veins are the parts which are 
destitute of trufinelles. The parent truffle, having accomplished its growth, 
and the formation of the reproductive bodies within, gradually dissolves, 
and supplies that aliment to the young vegetable which is proper for them. 
The cavity originally occupied by it in the earth is then left occupied by 
a multitude of young truffles, of which the stronger starve or destroy the 
others ; whilst they frequently adhere together, and, enlarging in size, re- 
produce the phenomena already described. One circumstance in the 
natural history of the truffle is still unexplained. If the method described 
be the only mode in which the truffle is reproduced, then it is difficult to 
comprehend the enormous multiplication of that vegetable in certain parts 
of France, where immense quantities are annually collected, without ex- 
hausting or even diminishing the race. If this fungus has no means of pro- 
gression, how can the young truffles leave the place of their birth, and 
become disseminated over the soil? (Revue Encyc. xxxv. 794.) 

Ranunculus bulbosus. — I was surprised, on 
taking up some plants of j^anunculus bul- 
bosus, to find the bulbs all double : they 
were confined to a particular spot : some, 
which I took up on a bank immediately 
opposite, were of the usual form. To give 
you a better idea of what I mean, I have 
sent you a sketch (Jig. 171.) of two of the 

roots. Perhaps some of your correspondents ^^^ ^"^^K^^ 171 
may favour me with an opinion as to the 
cause. I have not given my own, because I 
am not quite satisfied about it. — JD. S. Bun- 
gay^ April. [May not these bulbs be the 
usual mode of reproduction in the R. bulbo- 
sus, similarly to tne bulbs of crocus? — J. R.] 

Seed of ConvSlvuIus arv^nsis and C. s^- 
pium. — Sir J.E. Smith, in his English Flora, 
speaking of the Convolvulus arv^nsis, says, " I have never seen the cap- 
sule of seeds ;" and, under C. sepium, he says, " I have not seen the fruit." 
With respect to the existence of the fruit of the former plant, I cannot now

speak positiv^ely ; but, with regard to the latter (C. s^pium), the perfect seed- 
vessels are still hanging on the old stems in various places in this neighbour- 
hood in abundance ; nor do I ever remember a year in which they were 
not to be found; I have some now before me, collected in 1818. — 
Daniel Stock. Bungay, Suffolk, March, 1828. [The C. sepium does not 
seed freely, but there are few plants of it which do not produce one or 
more persistent capsules. Last summer I raised some from seed hanging 
dry on the plants the previous winter. — J. J?.] 

Cause of the Smell of new-made Hay. — I have always taken it for granted 
that the peculiar and beautiful scent of new-made hay was caused by the 
Anthoxanthum odoratum. ^fig. \'i'2^ a) A short time since I met with the 
following extract from a work called Elements of the Science of Botany, in 
which this opinion is disputed. " Towards the latter end of June and the 
middle of July, in Herefordshire and Worcestershire, this grass is brown 
and dry down to the root, yet that sweet odour peculiar to hay while it is 
making, is as powerful to the olfactory sense as in other counties, where it 
is made at an earlier season, when this grass, at the time of mowing, may be 
supposed to be in perfection. Another reason for objecting to the scent ex- 
clusively proceeding from this grass is, that, in meadows where it does not 
abound, no diminution of fragrance is perceived in the harvest ; it would 
therefore seem, under the most favourable circumstances, only to contribute 
its share, and not to be the sole cause of the fragrance of new-made hay. 
The sweet odour of this grass resides in the stem, more particularly in the 
joints, and not in the spike or flower." 

I think the late mowing in Herefordshire and Worcestershire is not a 
good reason for supposing that the hay is not indebted to this grass for its 
sweet scent, for I know that the Anthoxanthum odoratum will retain some 
of its fragrance for twelve months. Nor is the scarcity of this grass in any 
particular field at all conclusive, for I conceive that, comparatively speak- 
ing, a few plants would have the necessary effect. 

But, if the scent of new-made hay is not confined to the Anthoxanthum 
odoratum, then it becomes a question, from what other grass does it pro- 
ceed ? The following are the grasses which I have collected in this neigh- 
bourhood and dried, and from none of them did I ever perceive the least 
fragrance, except from the Anthoxanthum odoratum, and that which was 
gathered last spring still continues to give out its delightful scent, though, 
of course, fainter than at first. The names are from Smith's English Flora,

Mineralogy and Geology. 383 

This is not a complete list of the grasses growing in this neighbourhood, 
but the variety is sufficient for my purpose ; and taking into consideration 
the small space in which they were found, it contains as many as a similar 
extent of country in any other part of the kingdom will produce. Out of 
the number, twenty-eight at least grow upon Bungay Common. — D. Stock. 
' Bungay y April. 

As the grasses enumerated by our correspondent include the greater 
number of the most common species, we have figured them, in order to afTora 
our young readers an easy opportunity of acquiring their names. London 
students have only to purchase a truss of hay, out of which they may pick 
specimens of several of the species ; many, also, may be gathered in Ken- 
sington Gardens, or in any of the^ lanes and meadows round the metro- 
polis. — Cond. 



Art. IV. Mineralogy and Geology, 

Origin of Jet. — In the Cabinet of Mineralogy in Languedoc, M. Chap- 
tal preserved several pieces of wood, whose external part is in the state of 
jet, while the internal part still remains in the ligneous state ; so that the 
transition from the vegetable to the mineral state may be distinctly observed. 
At Montpelier have been dug up, several cart-loads of trees converted into 
jet, with their original forms so perfectly preserved, that the species of trees 
thus bitumenised can often be determined. A specimen of jet from Vachery 
can be distinctly recognised, as retaining the texture of the walnut tree ; and 
the texture of the beech can be traced in the jet from Bosrup, in Scania. 
The most singular instances, however, are those of a wooden pail and of a 
wooden shovel, which M. Chaptal, whose authority is undoubted, affirms 
to have been converted into pure jet. 

Age of Strata traced from their Orgajiic Remains. — The relative age of 
strata is often demonstrable, as in the instance of veins crossing andrecross- 
ing, which must as clearly have been formed after the strata which they 
cross, as the trench of a drain must have been formed after the strata of 
soil through which it passes. On a similar principle, it has been attempted to 
prove that the schistose strata at (Eningen have been formed within a recent 
period, because they not only contain distinct remains of the indigenous 
vegetables of the vicinity, but those of the walnut (Juglans regia). Now, 
the walnut not being an indigenous tree, the history of its introduction 
from Armenia into Italy, and thence into Germany, is known ; and, conse- 
quently, the chronology of it will pretty nearly determine the age of the 
strata. — J. R. 

Consequences of continued Disintegration of Strata. — According to Hut- 
tonian geologists (a class now diminishing no less rapidly than their rival 
Wernerians), the changes of the earth are interminable, both as to past and 
future. On Wernerian principles, we may say, I think, that the continual 
disintegration of rocks, and the continual travelling of their debris to lower 
levels, will at last reduce the globe to uniformity of level, such as some spe- 
culators suppose it to have been before the deluge, or, at least, before the 
fall of man. But Wernerians assert that some granites in Sweden have 
retained Runic inscriptions for 2000 years, and that basaltic columns pre- 
serve their angles well defined, in defiance of the influence of weathering ; 
forgetting, however, that they cannot tell whether those Runic inscriptions 
maintain their original depth of engraving, and that basaltic columns are 
disintegrated by being rolled from their jointings, and, afterwards, commi- 
nuted by attrition, &c. They say, also, that disintegration goes on in a 
decreasing ratio, as the rock becomes sheltered by soil ; forgetting that this 



384 Meteorology. 

soil is gradually washed away by rains, brooks, &€., and that the rock is by 
these means frequently, if not always, laid bare. They say farther, that 
detritus cannot be carried from places which are level ; but, if the sea is 
lower than the land, all the land may be considered as a series of staired 
plains, if I may use the expression ; and at every common section of a decli- 
vity and a plain, there is a tendency to efface the latter, by invading its 
boundaries or destroying its level. — J. R. 

Borax and Soda are recommended, as tests for manganese, by Berzelius, 
in his treatise on the blowpipe ; the former giving a purple, and the latter, 
on platina foil, a pale greenish blue glass. Soda, by itself, appears incapable 
of dissolving a sufficient quantity of manganese to impart to the glass a 
strong blue tint. Borax dissolves manganese easily, but the purple suit 
sometimes does not appear till after the addition of nitre, and is very 
obscure when the assay contains a large proportion of iron ; but the addition 
of a small quantity of soda to the assay, fused with borax on platina 
wire, readily brings out the purple colour, rather more inclining to blue 
than when borax alone is used ; and, finally, as more soda is added, it 
changes to a fine deep blue, that cannot be mistaken. — M. 



Art. V. Meteorology, 

Moisture of Climate infliLenced hy Trees. — The cutting down of forests, 
particularly on high grounds, has been remarked to diminish the quantity 
of rain, by diminishing, it is supposed, the attraction for clouds. The fact, 
however it may be explained, has been ascertained on a large scale in Ame- 
rica. In Kentucky, for example, many brooks are pointed out which now 
fail in summer, a thing which was unknown 20 or 30 years ago. In New 
Jersey, where the woods have been more extensively cleared, some streams 
have been altogether dried up. On the contrary, many streams in the 
United States have rather increased since the clearing of the woods ; be- 
cause, though the quantity of rain may be possibly diminished, the compact 
bed of forest leaves formerly retained the water on the surface, and exposed 
it to rapid evaporation ; whereas, the tillage which has been introduced, 
allows the water to penetrate to some depth, and to afford a more perma- 
nent supply for springs and streams. — J. R, 

Sea Air. — The atmosphere, in the vicinity of the sea, usually contains a 
portion of the muriates over which it has been wafted. It is a curious fact, 
but well ascertained, that the air best adapted to vegetables is pernicious to 
animal life, and vice versa. Now, upon the sea-coast, accordingly, animals 
thrive, and vegetables decline. {Harwood^s Southern Coast.) 

To ascertain the Course of the Airy when there is not any perceptible Wind 
blowing. — Place a basin of water in a free exposure, throw a red hot cin- 
der into it, and observe how the smoke which it produces inclines. Sailors 
throw a piece of live coal into the sea for the same purpose ; and also wet 
a finger, hold it up in the air, and then by feeling which part becomes first 
(by evaporation) cool, they judge of the direction of the current of air. An 
instrument on the last principle has been invented by Dr. B. M. Forster, and 
described in the London Journal of Arts and Sciences for May. {Mec. Mag.y 
vol. ix. p. 272.) 

Extraordinary Fall of Rain. — At Joyeuse, in the department of the 
Ard^he, during October, 1827,36 in. in depth fell within eleven days; and 
on the 9th of that month, 29 J in. fell within the space of two hours. During 
this excessive fall of rain, the barometer remained nearly stationary, at two 
or three lines below the mean altitude, notwithstanding the continuation 
of the most violent thunder and lightning during the whole time. (Annates 
de Chimie.)

Art. I. Natural History in Foreign Countries. 

FRANCE. 

Paris, Oct. 9. — Comparing Paris and London, with respect to wealth 
and population, the taste for natural history is niuch greater among the 
instructed classes, and more generally diffused among tradesmen and shop- 
keepers, in the former city, than in the latter. Perhaps the original cause 
of this difference, like the original cause of most of the permanent difJer- 
ences in mankind, may be traced to climate. France naturally produces 
finer flowers than England, and admits also of a greater variety of enjoy- 
ments in the open air. To the climate, therefore, may probably be traced 
the love of showy and odoriferous flowers, and of singing birds ; the esta- 
blishment in Paris of a flower-market, far superior to any thing of the kind in 
England ; and of the market for singing birds, which we have not in England 
at all. It may be said that what is sold in the flower and bird markets in 
Paris, is, in London, sold in shops, and in the green-houses in the King's 
Road : but this is not the fact ; independently of the bird-mai'ket, the num- 
ber of bird-shops in Paris is many times greater than in London ; and 
though there are more rare plants and forced roses and flowers to be 
seen in Mr. Colville's green-house in winter, than in any one green-house 
or shop in Paris at that season, yet the aggregate number of forced flowers 
in Paris is greater, and the plants and flowers are not purchased almost ex- 
clusively by the rich, for display at parties, as in London. In short, in Paris, 
orange trees in boxes and showy and odoriferous flowers are, comparatively, 
a necessary of life. It may be sufficient to mention that sprigs of orange 
trees, in blossom, are introduced generally in nosegays throughout the winter, 
and flowers of tuberoses as generally in summer. Cut flowers and flowering 
plants in pots are also common in churches, especially during religious 
fetes. 

The menagery in the Jardin des Plantes, and the rich and extensive col- 
lections in the museum of the same establishment, it may easily be conceived, 
have contributed to the taste for, and knowledge of, zoology, in persons of 
leisure, and we have no doubt that the same effect, and to an extent greater in 
proportion to the wealth and intelligence of the mass of society, will be pro- 
duced by the gardens of the Zoological Society of London. We should like 
to see the whole of the Regent's Park studded with the habitations of speci- 
mens of all the animals in the world, and dotted, grouped, and massed, with 
reference, at the same time, to picturesque beauty and the system of Jussieu, 
with all the hardy trees and shrubs that will endure the open air in our 
climate. Plants of the green-house and hot-house might be planted in the 
open ground (now occupied as a nursery), in the circular plot in the centre 
of the park, which might be covered with a glass roof supported on lofty 
cokunns, and the proper temperature kept up by lakes of hot water, and 
masses of rock heated by concealed fires. Here the botany and zoology of 

Vol. L — No. 4. d d 



386 Natural Histo)^ in Foreign Cotmfries, 

the tropics might be exhibited together, and specimens also introduced of 
tropical soils and mineralogy. The hollow cast-iron columns necessary for 
supporting the roof would be sufficiently numerous to serve both as con- 
duits of water from the glass, and as chimneys for the smoke and for ven- 
tilation. Cool air for the latter purpose, and also fuel to the fires, would be 
supplied from vaulted roads underneath. But this is perhaps deviating too 
far from the subject of natural history. 

It was observed to us, by an eminent naturalist here, that the French 
were greatly in advance of the English, in all that related to the preserv- 
ation of the subjects of natural history ; a fact which we think cannot be 
denied, on comparing by memory the preserved animals and birds in the 
British Museum, or even in the museum of the Zoological Society, with the 
national collections here. A very eminent artist in this way is M. Canivet, 
No. 22. Rue St. Thomas du Louvre, the joint author, with M. Boitard, the 
horticulturist, of the Manuel du Naturaliste PrlparateuTy a work of which 
we shall take an early opportunity of giving the essence. 

As the taste for zoology in London will be greatly increased by the gar- 
den of the Zoological Society, so we think the taste for plants in pots, the 
only description of flowers allowed to be exposed for sale in the flower- 
market here, might be increased by an improvement of a different descrip- 
tion. Suppose that, in imitation of what has taken place in Paris, burials 
were no longer permitted to be made in the churchyards of the metropolis, 
and that these receptacles, instead of being removed, or so far altered as to 
hurt the feelings of the living, were rendered depositories for flowers and 
ornamental plants in pots for sale. But, however much this might add to 
the salubrity and beauty of London, it is perhaps too great an innovation to 
be dwelt on at present. 

With respect to the taste for natural history among the country popula- 
tion of France, as compared with England, the difference is almost beyond 
calculation in favour of the latter country. With reference to taste and 
knowledge of every description, Paris, in relation to the French provinces, 
may be compared to a garden in a desert. In Paris every thing is in abun- 
dance and in perfection ; in the country the most deplorable ignorance 
prevails among almost all those who cannot aflbrd to pass a considerable 
part of the year in Paris. No great or lasting improvement will be effected 
in France till this ignorance be removed by the general education of the 
lower classes ; but, whenever this shall take place, the improvement in arts, 
sciences, and taste, will be great in proportion to the favourable climate of 
the country. Mr. Brown lately arrived here from the south of France, on 
his return to London. Mr. Swainson, the distinguished ornithologist, is 
here, busily occupied in making drawings and taking notes. Mr. Harvey, our 
eminent zoological draftsman, has also lately made his appearance. In our 
next we shall probably give some account of the Paris Natural History So- 
ciety, and of tne Linnean Society ; but we have hitherto been chiefly occu- 
pied with horticultural matters m the country, and to-morrow (Oct. 10.) 
we set ofTfor Munich and Stuttgard, to return hither in three or four weeks*

the bird, which was a male, was in fine feather, and exhibited no marks of

tains crabs, like those of the island of Amboina; at Bargberg, near Gehrden, 
oysters are found ; near Linden is a spring of petroleum ; near Badenstadt, 
at the foot of the Lindenerberg, a salt spring was discovered in 1778 ; near 
Norten there is a quarry of galena and sulphate of strontian ; in the bail- 
liage of Blumenau there was found a specimen of amber ; and near Bemerode 
is a mound of excellent plastic clay. The Deister possesses mineral springs, 
acidulous and ferruginous.

Proliferous Flowers. — M. Courtois has given excellent descriptions, in

and communicated specimens and figures of them to M. Nees of Bonn. 
The one is the JErysimum cheiranthdides, the other the Ver6nica media 
Schrad.y var. phyllantha. These proliferous varieties have been perpetuated 
for several years in the botanic garden of Liege. A singular variety of the 
Lonicera ii'ericlymenum is described in the same work by MM. Koning and 
Van Hall, in which the stamens have been transformed into a second 
corolla. {Bulletin des Sciences.)

SWITZERLAND. 

Migration of Butterflies. — On the 8th or 10th of the month of June, 
Madame de Meuron Wolff and all her family, established during the sum- 
mer in the district of Grandson, Canton de Vaud, perceived with surprise 
an immense flight of butterflies traversing the garden with great rapidity. 
All these butterflies were of the species called the Painted Lady, the Belle 
Dame of the French, the Papiiio c4rdui of Linnaeus, and Vanessa cardui of 
the modern system. They were all flying closely together, in the same 
direction, from south to north, and were so little afraid when any one ap- 
proached, that they turned not to the right or left. The flight continued 
for two hours without interruption, and the column was about 10 or 15 ft. 
broad. They did not stop to alight on flowers, but flew onwards, low and 
equally. 

This fact is exceedingly singular, when it is considered that the cater- 
pillars of the Vanessa cardui are not gregarious, but are solitary from the 
moment they are hatched. Professor Bonelli of Turin, however, observed 
a similar flight of the same species of butterflies in the end of the March 
preceding their appearance at Grandson. Their flight was also directed 
from south to north, and their numbers were immense. At night the 
flowers were literally covered with them. Towards the 29th of March 
their numbers diminished, but even in June a few still continued. They 
have been traced from Coni, Raconni, Suse, &c. A similar flight of butter- 
flies is recorded, at the end of the last century, by M. Loche, in the Me- 
moirs of the Academy of Turin. Daring the whole season, those butterflies,

Rock Blocks. — M. von Buch has undertaken to show that the rock 
blocks, which are scattered over the vicinity of Mount Jura and elsewhere, 
have been dissevered at once by a violent shock, and that they have not 
been simply rolled upon an inclined plain, nor carried along by avalanches, 
nor projected by explosions of gas, as M. de Luc supposed. He finds that 
the higher blocks of the Jura mtist have required an impetus of 557 feet to 
traverse in water alone (dans de i'eau pure), the space between the point 
of Ornex and the Jura. This is an impetus five times less than that of a 
cannon ball ; and if the water (as it must have been) were loaded with sludge, 
the weight of the blocks would be thence much diminished. He refers for 
proof of his theory to the bursting of the Lake De Bagne, which being 
situated 150 feet above the valley, rushed on with an impetus of 53 feet. 
Chains of mountains have been elevated upon the fissures made across the 
secondary deposits which have been rent, raised, and changed, while metals 
and oxygenated minerals have been introduced by gas into the formations. 
All the great Alpine valleys have a suite of lateral ravines, of contempora- 
neous origin with the mountain chains whose elevation produced the dis- 
persion of the blocks, the waters having risen, and forming a debacle^ 
descended with the debf^is through the rents made in the secondary chains. 
M. von Buch answers the objection of De Luc, as to the blocks being found 
behind the mountains, and not in the ravines between them, by making 
Mount Sion and Saleve genuine buttresses, behind which the blocks would 
naturally be carried. {Bulletin des Sciences.)

RUSSIA. 

Lignite. — M. Lichfeldt has discovered a mass of fossil wood upon one of 
the gulphs of the Danube, named Yalpoug, in the lower part of Bessarabia 
called Boudjak, about fifty vcrsts from the fortress of Ismail, and opposite 
the town of Belgrade, upon the right bank of the gulf between the villages 
of Kourtchi and Imnoiitsit. This fossil wood may become of great import- 
ance in that part of Russia, now entirely tieprivcd of forests. The lignite 
is found in the form of fissile masscs^pf a greyish colour, but passing in the 
lower portions into a deep black. In the u|)per parts are found quantities 
of the debris of wood, covered with bark, white, thick, and friable; the

pieces pressed one upon another, and intermixed with the husks of grain 
(cosses de cercales). The wood, according to M. Lichfeldt, is that of the 
lime tree. It lies nearly horizontal between coarse sand and calcareous 
clay ; the first in form of a wall, and the latter serving as a roof. Here many 
shells are found. The sand is separated from the stratum of lignite by 
about six inches of a resinous clay, in the lower part of which a great num- 
ber of shells of different sorts are found. The clay which covers the lignite 
is very slaty, and where they come in contact, an infinite number of small 
shells occur, chiefly I>6nax, Cdrdium, and Turbo. Over this lies an argil- 
laceous sand, even to the roots of the green sward. It is everywhere accom- 
panied by plastic clay. 

In a geographical point of view, this stratum of lignite is very interesting. 
According to preceding observations made in Germany, France, England, 
Switzerland, and Scandinavia, and confirmed by Humboldt in his examina- 
tion of the mountains of America, we ought to find lignite with plastic clay 
above the chalk formations. In Bessarabia, the chalk is seen cropping out 
near Mohilef on the Dniester, extending as far as Moldavia, in a north-east 
direction. The formations situated between this chain of mountains of 
chalk and the sea, present no analogy with the tertiary formations of 
France. Here, above the chalk, are found; 1. a toise and a half of coarse 
sand ; 2. eight inches of clay stone, with a portion of lime, of which the lower 
part contains a little silex ; 3. a calcareous cretaceous rock, 5 ft. thick, ter- 
minating at the upper part in oolite ; 4. a bed of sound and compact calca- 
reous stone, of little thickness ; and 5. the whole plateau as far as the 
Danube and the sea, is composed of calcareous stone, horizontal, and full 
of shells. In the cavities of this principal formation, and generally between 
Bender and the sea,in thedirection of north-east, is found siliceous limestone, 
with remains of shells, among which occur some pinnites. At a great dis- 
tance from the sea, upon the banks of the Bouik, the Reoute, the Koula, 
and other rivers, the limestone is covered with friable marl, with crystals of 
selenite. From the line of the Bender to Boudjak, immediately over the 
sand lies a movable limestone, composed almost wholly of shells, more or 
less mixed with iron ochre. Large masses of oolite limestone form the 
distinctive character of that formation which follows the chalk, and to 
which geologists give the name of tertiary, although the oolite limestone 
often occurs under the character of the Jura limestone, as one of the prin- 
cipal elements of formations of the second order. {Gornoi Journal, No. x.)

Tynan Purple Dye. — The shells from which the celebrated purple dye 
of the ancients was extracted, named by Pliny, the ilf urex and j^uccinum, 
have given occasion to disputes among modern naturalists as to the species 
meant. M. Lesson, upon comparing the description of Pliny with the Mol- 
lusca now found in the Mediterranean, is of opinion that the ^uccinum is 
the lanthina. It is a pelagian shell, and extremely numerous. It sustains 
itself on the surface of the sea by air vesicles, which Pliny calls a glutinous 
wax ; and as soon as it is taken out of the water, there escapes from it a very 
pure and very brilliant violet rose colour. Each shell contains an ounce 
of this in the dorsal vessel. By means of alkalies, this colour is readily 
changed to green. The lanthina abounds equally in the Atlantic as in the 
Mediterranean ; and, at certain seasons, the beaches of St. Helena and As- 
cension are entirely covered with them. From experiments made with this 
colouring matter, it appears to be a valuable reactive, turning red when 
treated with acids, and blue with alkalies. Oxalate of ammonia gives 
a deep blue precipitate, and nitrate of silver a pretty ash blue for painting 
in water colours. {Bidldin des Sciences.)

Geology. — Mr. Bird has just published an interesting paper on the geo- 
logy of Palestine. The Mount of Olives, near Jerusalem, is composed of 
soft limestone, as are also Mounts Carmel and Tabor. On the borders of 
^he Dead Sea, the rocks are tinged strongly with the red oxide of iron j 
but the most singular and unexpected fact is, that here are no volcanic 
rocks, at least on the western shore. Mount Ferdeas, or Bethulia, four or 
five miles from Bethlehem, is not volcanic, as has been asserted. Most of 
the elevated summits of Lebanon to the east of Beyruth, are composed of 
rocks containing shells and vegetable remains. {American Journal.) 

AFRICA. 

Grain and Bread found in an Egyptian Tonib. — M. Passalacqua having 
found a quantity of grain in an Egyptian tomb, it has been carefully ex- 
amined by MM. Julia Fontenelle, Le Baillif, 'and Kunth, who have deter- 
mined it to be common wheat (TYiticum sativum). M. Raspail, however, 
differs from those naturalists, and, by more minute examination, has satisfied 
himself that it is barley, which has been subjected to a considerable degree 
of heat ; and, on torrefying some fresh barley, it assumed the same appear- 
ance with the Egyptian grain. Along with the grain was found some bread, 
apparently unleavened. M. Raspail supposed the tomb to be that of a high 
priest, and refers to Leviticus ii. 14, 15., in which it is ordered to offer 
" green ears of corn, dried by the fire, even corn beat out of the full ear." 
Some Egyptian grain in the museum of Charles X., however, is certainly 
wheat, with some grains of torrefied barley mixed with it. Specimens of 
bread, in this museum, are similar to that found by M. Passalacqua. {Bul- 
letin des Sciences.) 

NORTH AMERICA. 

Scenery on the River Demerara. — After passing the third island, the 
plantations are separated by large tracts of wood ; and farther on, past 
Amelia's Waard, an unbroken range of forest covers each bank of the river. 
Sometimes the ground is level ; at other times, hilly, or with rocks " of an 
almost perpendicular height " jutting into the water. The trees display 
every variety of shade ; the tops of some of them are crowned with bloom, 
of the loveliest hue, while the boughs of others bend with a profusion of 
seeds and fruits. " There are patches of soil up and down, and the huge 
stones amongst them produce a pleasing and novel effect.*' In a country, 
with the most favourable climate for vegetation, and with the richest soil, 
the trees grow very tall, but not of very large diameter. The trunks of 
but few are 6 yards in circumference. " If larger have ever existed, they 
have fallen a sacrifice, either to the axe or to fire [or to the rich soil and 
rapid climate]. Four-footed animals are comparatively scarce. The pec- 
cari in herds of 300 or 400, the red monkey, polecat, fox, jaguar, small 
and large ant-bear, and sloth are the principal. The birds and snakes are 
most numerous, and unrivalled in beauty, the birds of Cayenne excepted. 
There are many sorts of fish, and myriacfs of insects, beautiful past descrip- 
tion in their variety of tints, astonishing in their form and size, and many of 
them noxious in their qualities. He whose eye can distinguish the various 
beauties of uncultivated nature, and whose ear is not shut to the wild 
sounds in the woods, will be delighted in passing up the river Demerara. 
Every now and then, the maam, or tinamou, sends forth one long and plain- 
tive whistle from the depths of the forest, and then stops ; whilst the yelp- 
ing of the toucan, and the shrill voice of the bird called pi-pi-yo, are heard 
during the interval. The campanero never fails to attract the attention of 
the passenger ; at a distance of nearly three miles, you may hear this snow- 
white bird tolling every four or five minutes, like the distant convent-bell. 
From six to nine in the morning, the forests resound with the mingled cries 
and strains of the feathered race ; after this, they gradually die away. From 



Natural Histoyy in Foreign Cowitries, 391 

eleven to three, all nature is hushed, as in a midnight silence, and scarce a 
note is heard, save that of the campanero and the pi-pi-yo ; it is then 
that, oppressed by the solar heat, the birds retire to the. thickest shade, and 
wait for the refreshing cool of evening. At sundown, the vampires, bats, 
and goatsuckers, dart from their lonely retreat, and skim along the trees on 
the river's bank. The different kinds of frogs almost stun the ear with their 
hoarse and hollow-sounding croaking, while the owls and goatsuckers lament 
and mourn all night long. About two hours before daybreak, you will 
hear the red monkey mourning, as though in deep distress ; the houtou, a 
solitary bird, and only found in the thickest recesses of the forest, distinctly 
articulates houtou, houtou, in a low and plaintive tone, an hour before sun- 
rise ; the maam whistles about the same hour ; the hannaquoi, pataca, and 
maroudi announce his near approach to the eastern horizon, and the par- 
rots and paroquets confirm his arrival there. The crickets chirp from sun- 
set to sunrise, and often during the day, when the weather is cloudy. The 
beteronge is exceedingly numerous in these extensive wilds ; and not only 
man, but beasts and birds, are tormented by it. Musquittoes are very rare 
after you pass the third island in the Demerara, and sand-flies but seldom 
appear." {Waterton.) 

SOUTH AMERICA. 

Lizards. — The colonists are particularly fond of the flesh of a very large 
sort of lizard, which is every where common in the shrubberies near the sea, 
where it lives upon crabs, and other animals cast up by the tide. The 
Monitor (Lacerta Tegmkin Linn.) is tolerably well figured in Seba (t. ii. 
pi. 105., fig. 1.), but erroneously, by him, made a native of Java. It is the 
object of an active chase on the part of the Brazilians, who employ, to take 
it, lines of brass wire, and hooks baited with a piece of meat. The voracity 
of this lizard is so great, that such an apparatus serves to take a great num- 
ber, every day, in spite of their shyness and agility. (Ann. des Sciences Nat.) 

Pearls. — The discovery of pearls in the province of Goyaz in Brazil, is 
due to the president, M. Lopez Gama, who caused researches to be made 
among the shells which abound in the salt-water lakes. He has found four 
perfect pearls, one large and three smaller. They are all finely rounded 
and polished. It is not said in what species of shells the pearls have been 
found. (Diario Fluminense, October.) 

Delta of the OroonoJco and the Maragnon. — The whole coast of Guiana* 
abounds in banks of mud, which are daily increasing, and causing the land- 
to encroach upon the sea. This process is greatly aided by the tangled 
roots of the Rhizophora Mangle^ which extend to the very edge of the 
waves, and even under the water. The rivers supply only a portion of the 
detritus, for the sea itself is muddy to the extent of 200 geographical miles 
by 10 in breadth, along the shore; whereas the rivers are quite limpid. That 
the Maragnon, however, contributes a considerable portion of alluvial mat- 
ter is probable, when we consider its extended course of 1350 miles, and its 
immense breadth of fifty miles at its embouchure, while its depth is very 
great. During the rainy season, and the melting of the snows on the Andes^ 
its inundations exhibit an immense sea of water, charged with earthy de- 
tritus and vegetable remains. The current is then so strong, that it is per- 
ceptible at 60 miles from the coast, and this, being opposed by the usual 
current of the Atlantic, from east to west, gives origin to vast banks of sand 
towards the shores of Brazil, on the north-west of Guiana. One of the cir- 
cumstances which contribute so powerfully to this effect, is the joororoca, 
or high flux, which occurs at the mouth of the Maragnon three days before 
every new and every full moon. It arrives in two hours at the beach, in 
mountainous waves of 12 to 15 ft. high. The sea is then driven more vio- 
lently towards the north-west ; and, along the coast of Guiana, forms very

strong currents towards Essequibo and the Gulf of Paria, becoming still 
stronger as they approach the Amazon river. The pororoca destroys the 
shores entirely between Fort Macapa and Cape North ; and, if there were no 
rocks, the beach would be still more dismantled, and the mouth of the Ma- 
ragnon turned altogether to the north. We owe these details to M. 
Gutsmuths. {Hertha, ix. 5. p. 381.)

List of Plants found t« Wanmckshire, varying with White Flowers. < — 
Sir, Perceiving that some of your correspondents have noticed the occur- 
rence, in various situations, of 5cilla nutans with white flowers^ I am in- 
duced to hope that the following list of white-flowered varieties, which I 
have myself observed in a native state in this county (Warwickshire), may 
not prove wholly unacceptable. 

Scabiosa arvensis and succisa, ^orago officinalis, found at AUesley. Pri- 
mula vulgaris, at Allesley, and at Wooton near Warwick; with a red 
flower, at Allesley. Campanula rotundifolia, at Allesley and at Coleshill ; 
latifolia, at Allesley. A very beautiful variety of this plant occurs commonly 
in the neighbourhood of the lakes in Cumberland and Westmoreland, with 
very pale flowers, tinged with deeper blue towards the calyx. In some 
parts of those counties this pale variety is more abundant than the dark- 
blue kind. Campanula patula, by the side of the old turnpike road, at the 
bottom of the nill near the village of Mcridcn. Plants of this white 
variety, raised from seed gathered in the above situation, and introduced into 
the garden, have for some years continued to propagate themselves spon- 
taneously. Fiola odorata, at Allesley, &c. ; with a red flower, at Castle 
Hill, Allesley, also on the mount at Warwick Castle; canina, at Coleshill ; 
with a very pale blue flower, near Coleshill Pool, (Scllla nutans, C'61chicum 
autumnale, at Allesley, &c. Kaccinium MyrtUlus (fruit and flower white).

in woods at Allesley and Corley. ^rica vulgaris, Tetralix, and cinerea, at 
Coleshill Heath. ^Lychnis Flosciiculi, at Coleshill ; dioica, at Allesley. 
iRosa canina, at Allesley and many other places. A'jiiga reptans, at Coles- 
hill. ^etonica officinalis, Prunella vulgaris, at Allesley. Pedicularis paliis- 
tris, on Coleshill Heath. Digitalis purpurea, at Coleshill. Geranium molle, 
at Allesley, &c.; Roheviianum, at Wooton, near Warwick. Polygala 
vulgaris, also with pink flowers, and also with very pale blue flowers, on 
Coleshill Heath, Corley Moor, &c. J'rifolium officinale, at Coleshill, &c. 
5^erratula tinctoria, in bogs near Coleshill. Cnicus lanceolatus, palCistris, 
and arvensis, at Allesley, &c. O'rchis morio and latifolia, at Coleshill; 
conopsea, in bogs near Coleshill ; maculata, flowers pure white, at Allesley, 
Coleshill, &c. 

The following plants, varying in the colour of the flower, have also been 
observed : — i^osa spinoslssima, with flesh-coloured flowers, on the road- 
side at Guy's Cliff* turnpike, near Warwick. Achillea ilf illefolium, with 
red flowers, at Allesley, &c. Malva sylvestris, a very beautiful variety, with 
blue flowers, on a piece of arable land near Coleshill. (Sambucus nigra, 
with white fruit, also white-flowered varieties, at Coleshill, &c. .S'olanum 
Dulcamara, Fritillaria meleagris, near Oxford. Chironm Centaureum, near 
Dudley. jSjmphytum officinale, with purple flowers, near Oxford. 

¦It will almost immediately occur to any one, on perusing the above list, 
that the plants most apt to produce white varieties are such as usually bear 
blue, purple, or pink flowers. Yellow flowers are but little subject to vari- 
ations in colour. The common cowslip, however, when raised from seed in 
a garden, is an excej)tion, though, in a perfectly wild state, I never knew it 
to vary in colour. 1 am, Sir, &c. — W. T. Bree. Allesley Rectory^ near

Lysimachia Nummuldna. — In a' marshy spot, by the Thames side, be- 
tween Ham and Kingston, the Xysimachia Nummularia may be found (but 
not very plentifully), with the leaves, calyx, and corolla thickly covered 
with dark-red glandular spots. — E. K. 

Scilla nidansy with white flowers, mentioned by several of your correspon- 
dents as extremely rare, may be found in great plenty in all the copses near 
Leith Hill, a beautiful spot, about six miles from Dorking, and abounding 
in all sorts of scarce and curious plants. Near it was the residence of the 
celebrated author of the Sylva. If, Sir, you should think it desirable, I will 
send you a list of some of the most beautiful flowers which flourish in this 
part of the country. I remain. Sir, &c. — William Perceval Hunter. 

We shall be glad to receive such a list, together with a notice of the best 
spot, near Leith Hill, for a London naturalist to take a lodging for a week 
or two, with a view to exploring the neighbourhood. — Cond. 

Manne Shelh. — Sir, about a mile from this place is a hill called Black 
Down, which, I suppose, may be about 600 ft. above the level of the sea, 
and sixteen miles from the nearest tide-mark. On the side of this hill are 
a number of excavations, some of them carried 500 yai'ds under ground in 
a straight horizontal line, which, at the further end, may be 100 ft., some 
more or less, below the surface. These excavations are made for the pur- 
pose of bringing out the stones (which are found in detached masses 
amongst the sand), in order to be cut for whetstones, and which are con- 
sidered the best in England. In these stones the miners frequently meet 
with lumps of marine shells, of various sorts, and as hard and perfect as if 
newly taken out of the sea. — Robert Reid. Montrath House, near Col-

The Beavers on the Severn. About a mile to the north of Wor- 
cester, a little brook enters the Severn, called Barbourne, or Beaver- 
bourne, to the present day, from the beavers (Castor i^iber) that formerly 
inhabited the brook j a little island in the Severn, near the spot, is still 
known as the Beaver island ; and, higher up the stream of the Severn, is a 
flat green island, called Bevereye, which also gives its name to an adjoin- 
ing hamlet. How late the beavers remained here is unknown ; but the 
Severn was not navigable near Worcester in early times, from the weirs and 
rapids that obstructed its course. Giraldus states that beavers were very 
scarce in Wales in the twelfth century. v 

A Red-legged Crow (Corvus Graculus) was shot at Lindridge, in this 
county, in November, 1826, a bird rarely wandering so far from its usual 
haunts. In your Magazine (p. 83.), a correspondent mentions the little 
woodpecker (Picus minor), and states his bird to be, perhaps, " the only 
authentic British specimen ; " but a friend of mine has a specimen, shot some 
years ago in Nunnery Wood, near this city. 

The Crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) visits the fir trees at Hadley Green and 
Cotheridge, near Worcester, each spring and autumn, but in small numbers 
of twenty or thirty. They have a leader or sentinel, who, with the others, 
makes a continual tutter, tutter, tutter, among the trees. Some years ago, a 
number of crossbills were caught alive, and offered for sale here ; some were 
kept in cages, but they all soon died, most probably from improper treat- 
ment. Old writers on natural history accuse them of visiting Worcester- 
shire and Herefordshire, in great flocks, in autumn, for the sake of the seeds 
of the apple, which they pierced with their curved bills. The> thus did great 
mischief in orchards, as they only eat the seeds, and therefore wasted quan- 
tities of apples. Repeated persecution, on this account, perhaps, lessened 
their numbers, and their depredations in the present day are unnoticed or 
unknown. 

Puffins. About six miles to the north of Worcester is Westwood Park, 
in which is an old mansion of the age of Henry VIII., and a large pool. In 
a late conversation with an old man in the vicinity, upwards of eighty, he 
informed me that, formerly, puffins (A'lca arctica) annually visited the pool 
here, but it is now about six years since they have discontinued visiting it, 
as he has not seen one within that time. He also assured me that, in 1821, 
he saw the great northern diver (Colymbus glacialis) on the pool, a singularly 
rare straggler so far to the south. He particularly noticed it from its size, 
and observed it dive several times, bringing up a fish after each submersion. 
He says that the other birds on the pool kept at a distance from it, being 
much alarmed at it. He recollects pointing out the bird to Sir John Pack- 
ington, proprietor of the park, but he would not allow its being shot. The 
pool or lake is very retired ; no boat is on it, and scarcely any person is ever 
suffered to approach it. — Edwin Lees. Worcester, July 20. 1828. 

Tall Bristly Rose. — I have, this summer, found thei^osa gracilis in some 
plenty, in thickets near Cruckbarrow Hill, Worcester, a more southerly 
station than is assigned to it in Sir J. E. Smith*s English Flora. — Id. 

A Nest of the jotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa grisola) was brought me

belonging to the cottage. The nest is carelessly put together, yet prettily

since, as some workmen were sinking a well near Woodend, in this county, 
about eight miles from the Hambleton Hills, at the depth of 60 or 70 
yards they came to a large mass of compact red granite, which, not being 
able to remove, they cut through. Granite has also been found in sevferal 
places towards the hills. The soil in that part of the country is a rich 
alluvial earth, to a good depth. What makes this still more curious is, that 
no granite is found in that part of the country, as the Hambletons are com- 
posed principally of mountain limestone. It is, therefore, more than pro- 
bable, that this stratum is connected with others of the same nature in the 
Hambletons ; for, if it is not stratified, can you or any of your readers 
account for the presence of the granite in such immense masses ? This 
question is well worth the attention of any person conversant in these mat- 
ters. — L. E. O. Eichmoiid, Yorhskire, August 16. 1828. 

Snakes caught hy Fishermen. — Sir, On Saturday last, August 2, a fisherman 
brought me a snake (Coluber A^atrix Lin.) which he had caught in his iKJt, 
while fishing in Haslar Lake, one of the branches of Portsmouth harbour ; 
and, on the following morning, a seaman brought me a second, alive and 
healthy, which had been just caught from the tide, on the opposite shore, 
among the boats, at the sally-port, or landing-place, at Portsmouth. Both 
the men were amazed at the occurrence j and the former, an aged fisher- 
man, had never met with the like before. I am. Sir, &c. — Henry Slight,

Museum at NorwicJi. — This establishment owes its origin to a few scien- 
tific and public-spirited individuals residing in Norwich and its vicinity, who, 
in 1824, united themselves for the purpose of promoting the study of natural 
history. At this time, a body of laws and regulations were drawn up, a pre- 
sident, vice-president, and a committee of twelve gentlemen appointed, for the 
transaction of business, and apartments taken in the Ha3'-market, under the 
rooms of the Literary Institution, for the reception of their future collec- 
tion. The late lamented president of the Linnean Society, Sir J. E. Smith, 
was elected president, which office he filled till his death ; on which occur- 
rence, Dawson Turner, Esq., of Great Yarmouth, author of Synopsis of 
British Yuciy &c. &c., was appointed. The present object of this Society is 
confined to collecting specimens in natural history, together with coins, an- 
tiques, and miscellaneous ai'ticles which are objects of curiosity and admir- 
ation, as well to the general as the scientific observer ; hoping, by this 
means, to excite a spirit of enquiry, and promote the pursuit of this inte- 
resting and engaging study. Should this attempt be successful, in inducing 
many to support the establishment by their purses and patronage, they will 
be enabled to pursue their plans of publishing their proceedings, establish- 
ing lectures, and adopting such means as would render the establishment 
more effectual in disseminating that spirit and that knowledge which it is 
their wish to promote. 

Their museum now contains several skeletons and parts of skeletons, 
animals, and birds, including the hippopotamus, elephant, buffalo, crocodile, 
and lion ; a few animals preserved ; about 300 specimens of ornithology, 
chiefly British ; a valuable cabinet of South American insects, consisting of 
about 4000 specimens ; a cabinet of British insects, consisting of about 
2000; a few specimens of conchology, and about .350 specimens of mine- 
ralogy and geology, besides 300 specimens of fossil organic remains. In 
botany it possesses but few specimens, chiefly from Switzerland. 

To these may be added, a small collection of coins, Roman and other an- 
tiquities, various instruments of war and numerous other articles from dif- 
ferent countries, and an Egyptian mummy and sarcophagus.

Medicago denticuldtay Orohdnche caryophyUaceOy and O'phrys apt/era. — 
Sir, It was not my intention to publish a notice of some plants recently 
discovered in our island, before the appearance of a " Catalogue of Plants 
growing wild in this neighbourhood," which I must now, from necessity, 
delay for a few months. 

The plant which I particularly desire to make known, that your readers 
may, while the season lasts, observe upon its occurrence elsewhere, is the 
Medicago denticulata of Willdenow (vol. iii. 1414.), and, probably, Ray's 
" Medica marina supina nostras foliis viridibus ad sumraos ramulos vil- 
losis." {Jig. 177.) This species is common 
with many others of its tribe (Trifolium 
suflfocatum, subterraneum, scabrum, glomera- 
tum, &c.), along this coast, from the foot 
of the chalk escarpment at Folkestone, west- 
wards, to New Romney and Rye. Messrs. 
Sowerby, of Lambeth, have specimens from 
Southampton. The plant is at once distin- 
guished by the beautifully-reticulated surface 
of its legumes, which are of few convolu- 
tions, furnished with a double row of short, 
divaricated, hooked thorns ; and, in a ripe 
state, black. The leaves are without spots ; 
and, except at the extremity of the branches, 
destitute of hair. The legumes attracted my 
attention last autumn, long after the plant had ^^^^ered I sent some to 
the late lamented president of the Lmnean Society, who did not, however,

Art. III. Natural History in Scotland, 

Glasgo w Royal Botanic Garden. — ^The following statement, understood to 
be drawn up by Dr. Hooker, was published by the directors of this establish- 
ment in January last : — It is now some time since any public notice has 
been taken of the actual state and condition of this interesting establish- 
ment ; which, in spite of the difficulties attendant upon its limited means, 
and the error committed at its foundation, in not requiring from each 
proprietor a small annual sum for its support, has yet flourished beyond 
what its most sanguine friends could have expected. The funds destined 
for meeting its yearly expenditure arise principally from three sources j the 
sale of plants, annual subscriptions, and voluntary annual contributions. 
The failure of any one of these must materially cramp the means of carrying 
on this institution. The first of these sources has been found to increase 
in at least an equal ratio with the extent of the collection ; and whatever 
may be the objections in the minds of some of the proprietors to such a 
mode of increasing the income of the garden, the produce arising from it 
is of vastly too much consequence to allow of the practice being discon- 
tinued. The second source of emolument, namely, the annual subscrip- 
tions, may also be expected to add still more to our funds, in proportion 
as the interest and beauty of the garden become more generally known. 
In regard to yearly contributions, these, being voluntary, fluctuate accord- 
ing to the views, feelings, and circumstances of the proprietors. Yet, surely, 
since by the fundamental laws of the institution such receipts cannot be 
enforced, a sense of the value of the collection, whether taken in a scien- 
tific or a pecuniary light, might induce the shareholders to do that which 
will so essentially tend to the maintenance and still greater increase of 
the worth of that collection. 

At the time of the publication of our Catalogue of Plants in 1825 
(which, by its distribution, has been the means of making known the extent 



400 Natural Histoy in Scotland. 

of our riches in this department to almost every part of the globe), the 
number of species and distinct varieties was estimated at upwards of 8000. 
To these have lately been added little short of 5000 more; and these, too, 
as might be supposed, are, in general, vegetable productions of the greatest 
novelty and rarity, so that it may again be repeated with confidence, that, 
in point of number of species, which forms the distinguishing character of a 
real botanic garden, no one in this kingdom, or perhaps in Europe, can be 
compared with it. The erection of the new, and, from the way in which 
it is stocked with plants, highly ornamental house, at the western extremity 
of the great range, has enabled the larger individuals to be so arranged, as 
to afford them greater freedom in their growth, and to allow of their being 
seen to much more advantage. This will especially be observed upon the 
slightest inspection of the palms, those nobles of the vegetable kingdom, 
as Linnaeus so happily called them, many of which are already beginning 
to wear that aspect of grace and beauty which eminently characterises 
their form in their native climes. In the same house (the great stove), 
the banana or plantain tree may again be expected, as it did four years 
ago, to bear its flowers and its fruit, and to bring the latter to perfection. 
T'he papaw tree, so remarkable for the property which its juices possess 
of rendering old and tough meat tender in a short space of time, if but 
slightly washed with it, nay, even of producing the same effect upon the 
flesh of old animals that feed on it, whether hogs or poultry ; this tree, 
having room to flourish, now has several fine fruits upon it, which are 
rapidly advancing to maturity. Though not belonging to the palm tribe, 
yet, like them, the papaw tree rises with a tall and slender stem, bearing a 
tuft of leaves at the top, and the fruit and flowers immediately beneath. 
Similar in general growth to these are the tree ferns, yet of such rarity, 
that we know of no collection in Europe where there is a single living indi- 
vidual ; but, during the course of the last year, we had the good fortune to 
receive no less than three healthy young plants^ through the liberality of 
His Excellency General Walker, from St. Helena ; whilst a fourth, of the 
same kind, but a different species from those now mentioned, has been 
brought to us by Captain Farmer, from Mr. Eraser, of New Holland. We 
have valuable correspondents at Trinidad, who may be said to replace the 
loss we sustained in the death of the Baron de Schack. His Excellency 
Sir Ralph Woodford, and the able botanic gardener there, have communi- 
cated many plants, but none more valuable than tne nutmeg, the first that 
ever came alive to this country, the Jack tree, and the mangosteen. For 
their security during the voyage we are indebted to Messrs. Eccles, of this 
city, who have shown a most liberal and unvarying attention to the interests 
of the institution. The famous arracacha of South America, in which 
country its prolific roots hold the place of the potato, and are equally nu- 
tritive, has been again sent to us, with other rarities, especially some young 
mangoes, by Dr. Bancroft, Dr. M*Fadyen, and Mr. R. Smith, of Jamaica. 
To John Pearson, Esq., of Demerara, we are indebted for some curious 
plants of the Indian kale; to Thomas M'Gill, Esq., of Glasgow, and his 
brother. Captain M'Gill, for many East Indian productions ; to the late 
lamented General Turner, for several vegetables of Sierra Leone ; to Mr. 
Elliot, of South Carolina, for a numerous collection of plants from that 
rich country. Our noble cactuses, or Turk's-cap torch thistle, the envy of 
every garden in Europe, are all the valued present of Captain M'Arthur, of 
the Everthorpe ; the curious Tamus elephdntipes, or Elephant's foot, of 
R. Finlay, Esq., from the Cape. Amongst the fir tribe we possess the fa- 
mous Norfolk Island pine, procured by Mr. Eraser, government botanist at 
New Holland, and brought to us, with many other plants from that country, 
by Sir Thomas Brisbane; the Chilian pine, from Mr. Cruickshanks ; and 
the Brazilian pine. These, in their native soil, arc reckoned amongst the 
tallest and most remarkable trees in the world. The bread-fruit may hero

be seen, whose history is connected with one of the most interesting and 
affecting narratives that have ever been recorded, in the mutiny of the crew 
of the Bounty, and in the preservation of Admiral Bligh, and the sub- 
sequent settlement of the mutineers on Pitcairn's Island, wliere the prin- 
cipal of them, with his family, by sober, industrious, and religious habits, 
seems destined, by one of the mysterious ways of Providence, to carry 
civilisation into the islands of the South Seas. This individual bread-fruit 
was sent to us by Dr. Eraser, of Berbice, but in so sickly a state that we 
dare not hope it will recover; yet we do not despair of again receiving and 
cultivating it successfully. Numerous are the vegetables indeed in our 
garden, which, a few years ago, it was not considered possible to keep alive 
any where but in their native country, and which are now flourishing in 
our stoves. The nutmeg, and especially the extensive tribe of air plants, 
as they are called, no les's remarkable for their place of growth (the trunks 
of trees) than for the splendour of their flowers, are striking examples of 
this. The mahogany was long known to us solely by the beauty and utility 
of its wood, yet now we have good plants of it in a living state ; and, by 
the kindness of an enlightened merchant of this city, the writer of this 
Report is enabled to publish, together with a figure, a history, commercial 
as well as botanical, of this most valuable of all trees. It is the staple 
article of trade of Honduras ; and there, at the season of cutting the tim- 
ber, the woods, at other times a desert, are alive with the labourers engaged 
in that singular duty. The double or Maldivian cocoa-nut tree was, till 
within these few years, only known to the wild inhabitants of the Seychelles 
Islands ; now, the fruit has reached our shores in a vegetable state j and 
one individual, at the present time in England, is destined for our garden. 
Of other palms we possess nearly forty species. The plants of Arctic 
America, of the Rocky Mountains, that vast alpine range, forming a con- 
tinuation of the chain of the Andes, which has just been explored during 
two entire years by one of Dr. Richardson's collectors (Mr. Drummond of 
Forflxr), were, till lately, only known to the Canadian hunters, or the Esqui- 
maux, or the still more savage Indians of North-west America. These may 
very shortly be seen in cultivation in our gardens, of which they will form 
a highly interesting and distinguishing feature. From Captain Franklin 
alone, who commanded the overland arctic expedition, we have received a 
parcel of 300 seeds. Among the useful plants of our collection we may 
reckon the green and black tea, the coffee, the chocolate, gum arable, 
jujube tree, tamarind, logwood, gmger, arrow root, turmeric; pepper, no 
less than thirty-three kinds, though none of them more valuable than the 
black pepper of the shops ; the sago, date, cocoa nut, Otaheitan gooseberry, 
camphor, sugar cane, bamboo, &c., not to mention many others ; a new and 
excellent species of guava [query — the species, and a hint for its culture, 
for Gard. Mag.], whose fruit, which ripened last year, was pronounced by 
all that tasted it to be delicious, and fitted to rank with the most choice of 
cur desserts. iVmong the more curious and ornamental plants, we must 
not omit to notice our numerous banksias and dryandras, for which we 
are mainly indebted to Mr. Mackay, of Clapton ; the various new calceo- 
larias, or slipperworts, and fuchsias, the gift of our inestimable South 
American correspondents, Dr. Gillies and Mr. Cruickshanks ; the papyrus, 
now arrived at a height of from 12 to 14 ft.; the India rubber tree, which, 
could we have afforded it space enough, would ere now have attained the 
height of 40 ft; the side-saddle flower, the famous pitcher plant, the fly- 
trap or dionaea, the star apple ; the cherimoja, a present from Her Grace the 
Duchess of Montrose ; the manchineel, the alligator pear; the buonapartea, 
so named in honour of our late formidable enemy, and of which the sharp 
pungent foliage seems to be characteristic of that hero ; and, lastly, we 
may mention what will soon be in great perfection, for they are among the 
earliest-flowering plants in the great green-house, the numerous varieties of

to enumerate all the persons, whether in a public or private capacity, who 
have rendered services to the institution, and it would but appear invidious 
to make a selection ; suffice it to say, that the Directors have ever felt a 
grateful sense of their kindness. We cannot conclude this report, already 
perhaps extended to too great a length, without expressing a fervent wish 
that it were possible to put this noble and deserving establishment upon a 
permanent foundation. In considering the proprietors individually, this 
would be the most simple of all things, for a small annual sum from each 
would render it perfectly independent ; and, let it be observed, that such is 
the plan with every other institution of the kind in the kingdom. It can 
only be done here by general consent : whereas, now, the expense, which 
ought to be shared by all, falls only upon the generous and the liberal ; 
whose names, however, will stand enrolled in the Annals of the Society aft 
its disinterested friends and patrons.

August. — Flora. The spring-like weather which has continued through- 
out the summer months, keeps many plants in flower which are usually 
over at this time. The only garden flower which particularly marks the 
season is the autumnal crocus (C'olchicum officinalis), which flowered on the 
29th. Harvest began in a few favoured spots in the last week of July, was 
generally in hand by the middle of August, but much retarded by frequent 
rains. 

Fauna. The great body of swifts (Cypselus ^pus Cuv.) was observed 
passing to the south-westward on the 10th and 1 Ith ; the last (a single one) 
was seen on the 18th. Towards the end of the month, swallows and house 
martens congregate, and are often seen resting on the ridges or sloping roofs 
of buildings. 

September. — Flora. In the beginning came forth the Colchicum varie- 
gatum, G^entia7?a purpurea, Helianthus atrorubens, Heliopsis laeVis, ^'chium 
grandiflorum, ^pargia_T'araxaci, and several of the perennial asters. 

Fauna. Except swallows and house martens, very few migratory sum- 
mer birds are seen after the middle of the month. The sedge warbler 
(Curruca salicaria) was the last observed. The redbreast*s winter song 
is already heard. The notes of a few late-breeding song-thrushes were 
heard on the 12th. A pair of these birds hatched their young so late 
as the 15th, in the court of the Royal Military Asylum, Chelsei. It is 
remarkable that they chose for their nestling place one of the lower boughs 
of an elm, immediately over the gymnastic exercise ground, and in the 
midst of the noise and violent action of hundreds of boys, besides the fre- 
quent rolling of drums and all other military music daily. The young 
flew, being protected, while in the nest, by a special order of the com- 
mandant. 

Insects have not been so numerous as they are in dry summers, and many 
which appear early have only made their appearance lately. Garilen insects 
Ve only seen about London, especially those that visit the discoiis flowers. 
Among them were noticed a few of the splendid grand admiral butterfly 
(Vanessa Atal^nta), appearing about the 8th ; and, on the same flowers, many 
of the genus JWusca and Bomb> lius ; also all the common species of T'ipula, 
Tab^nus, Culex, and ^silus. The warm weather has brought forth many 
spiders ; the Diadema unusually numerous ; the Montkna appeared on the 
24th.

October, — Flora. The garden and field flowers of last month, in con- 
sequence of the fine weather, still continue ; to which are added the ^'ster 
^melius, grandiflora, and Nova A'ngliae ; Dianthus glaucescens, Gnapha- 
lium, 5tce'chas, &c. 

Fauna. Swallows and house martens are now about taking their depar- 
ture ; the last swallow was seen on the 12th, and the martens were all gone 
on the 1 8th. Fieldfares and redwings arrived about the 15th, and wood- 
cocks about the 19th. Swans beat away their cygnets. Cabbage butterflies 
rather numerous, and busy depositing their eggs on broccoli, &c. 

The Weather. — After a long course of changeable weather, it began to 
clear up about the 20th of August. From that time, with but few inter- 
ruptions, it has continued fine, enabling the farmer to finish harvest work, 
and the hop-grower to secure his produce. From the 15th to the 26th of 
September, remarkably fine and warm. — J. M. October 20.

Notwithstanding the two ensuing months are the waning and dreary 
portion of the year, there are many incidents which attract the attention 
of the observer of nature. Though the trees have lost, or are losing, their 
honours, and vegetation has generally made a pause, the rural scene is not 
destitute of interest. 

Birds. — The migrating summer songsters are all fled ; but other visitors, 
driven from the north by a severe winter, appear in our neighbourhood. 
These are the different species of the genus ^colopax, woodcock, snipe, &c.; 
and it often happens that, in inland level countries, several species of the 
genus Falco are seen only in the winter months. At this season, larks are 
congregated, and roost closely together on the ground ; where, for want of 
larger game, they often become a prey to the night-prowling fox; chaffinches, 
and other small birds, congregate and roost together in thick hedges ; trout 
repair to their spawning places ; and, if it is open weather, snails and some 
insects are in motion. 

In the Jish-markets^ cod, turbot, soles, gurnard, doree, skate, whitings, 
herrings, &c., are in season ; as also lobsters, crabs, prawns, shrimps, oysters, 
and other testacea, in great perfection.

404 Biography : '-^ John Tetnpleton, Esq. 

worthy of being placed in company with that eminent naturalist. Every 
one present will at once perceive that 1 refer to the late John Templeton, 
a man devoted, like Linnaeus, to every branch of natural history, and whose 
enthusiastic attachment to it continued to the end of his life. The biography 
of a retired man of science, like a deceased friend, seldom presents much 
that is interesting to the world at large, especially when he has not come 
much forward as an author; but those who have known and respected him 
will take pleasure in such details as may make them more acquainted with 
him, or may recall him to their recollection ; and, in particular, you, who 
are engaged in the same pursuit, will be gratified by even an imperfect 
account of his exertions, of his discoveries, and of the treasures he has left 
behind him. Whilst, in compliance with your wish, I have undertaken to 
pay this tribute of respect, I must regret that it was not undertaken by 
some one who had been longer and more intimately acquainted with him, 
and who could, therefore, have done more justice to the subject. The 
readiness, however, with which sources of information have been laid open 
to me by the family, have, I hope, enabled me to fulfil your desire better 
than I could have expected ; and I have myself derived considerable pleasure 
in the employment; whilst the character, as well as the talent and in- 
formation, of our departed friend, has risen greatly in my opinion, as I 
have become more acquainted with him. 

Mr. Templeton was born in Belfast, in the year 1766. His father resided 
there, and at his country house in Malone, near this town, where tlie family 
have been settled since the early part of the 17th century, and where he 
himself constantly lived since his father's death. To this place he gave the 
name of Crann-raore, i. e. the Great tree, in honour of the very fine chest- 
nut trees which are in front of the house, and which were probably planted 
in the 1 7th century, though there is no record respecting them. It had been 
previously called Orange Grove. His very delicate state of health, when a 
boy, was probably the cause of his attention being early turned to natural 
history. When unable to partake of active amusements, he took great 
delight in a book of natural history, containing pictures of birds, fishes, &c. ; 
which pictures he used to copy, and with which, and the descriptions, he 
used to compare the various birds which his friends, knowing the pleasure 
it gave him, procured and sent him. That habit of discrimination, which 
natural history is well calculated to form, was thus early acquired. His 
earliest education he received at the school of Mr. Manson, a name yet 
respected in this neighbourhood. As he grew up he became attached to 
fowling and fishing, but gave up the former on witnessing the sufferings 
of a wounded bird, and was ever afterwards remarkable for his kind attention 
to every part of the animal creation. In this he set an excellent example 
to naturalists, for he always contrived to gratify his curiosity without pain 
to the subject of it, and would, at any time, have lost the opportunity of 
acquiring knowledge, rather than be the cause of suffering to a living crea- 
ture. When circumstances justified the deprivation of life, he considered 
how it might take place with the least pain. Benevolence to men and 
brutes was, indeed, a striking feature in his character ; and those who, on 
many subjects, differed from him in opinion, could not but have approved 
the motive by which he was ever actuated, — a desire to promote the hap- 
piness of his fellow-creatures. From various passages in his w ritiiigs I select 
one, in proof of my assertion. " It is often," says he, " within the power 
of man to exercise a portion of benevolence; and while philanthropy ^n- 
fines kindness to our own species, the divine attribute of benevolence 
extends to every living creature, and calls to us to alleviate their sufferings. 
While snow covers the earth, and frost binds up the waters, the feeling 
heart must pity the distress, and strive to give comfort and sustenance to 
the winged inhabitants of the air, whose lively motions interest, and whose 
music adds a charm to the rural scene. Many, driven from their native 



Biography : — John Templet07i, Esq, 405 

wilds by the inclemency of the season, seek the plains of Ireland, in hopes 
of finding that comfort which their own country denied them; but scarcely 
are they arrived, fotigued with the length of their journey, and weak from 
want of food, ere they experience new calamities. In vain do they seek the 
silent wood, or trust to generosity for protection ; for no pangs are felt by 
the greedy epicure or thoughtless sportsman, when innocence and beauty 
die. It is to innocence and beauty they call for protection. Let the youth- 
ful hand scatter food, and they will give life and happiness to hundreds ; 
let them guard their rural walks against all destroyers of the feathered 
tribes, and the consciousness of having done a good action will make the 
music of the groves awaken ideas which the virtuous alone can enjoy.'' 
In another place I find him quoting with approbation the beautiful lines of 
Cowper, — 

" I would not enter on my list of friends, 
(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense. 
Yet wanting sensibility,) the man 
Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm. 

# * * 

The sum is this : — If man's convenience, health, 
Or safety, interfere, his rights and claims 
Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs. 
Else they are all — the meanest things that are, 
As free to live, and to enjoy that life, 
As God was free to form them at the first. 
Who in his sovereign wisdom made them all." 

Mr. Templeton began to cultivate flowers about the year 1786, and soon 
made his flower-garden an object of attention ; but it was not till after his 
father's death, in 1790, that, on recovery from a severe illness, he began to 
study botany with enthusiasm as a science ; having been first directed to 
it by a desire of extirpating weeds from his farm, to which he then applied 
himself. Having made himself well acquainted with the Linnean system, 
he, in 1793, laid out his experimental garden, if I may so call it, which is 
said to have been suggested by a passage in Rousseau's Heloise. I'his had 
been partly an orchard, partly an osier ground ; and conducting through it 
a stream of water, raised on an artificial rock, he rendered it in every 
way fit for the intended purpose. Here he collected, from various parts of 
the world, rare and useful plants, which he endeavoured to naturalise in 
this climate, by placing them in a soil and situation resembling, as nearly as 
possible, that to which they had been accustomed. By this means there is 
growing, in his garden, in the open air, a wonderful and curious collection 
of plants from India, China, North and South America, Siberia, &c. : such 
as Camellia japonica, T/zefl! viridis (the tea-plant), Ailanthus prae'cox, and 
others, which were formerly kept in the hot-house, and then in the green- 
house. Most of the trees at Cranmore (all, I beheve, except the chest- 
nuts and oaks) were raised from seed or planted by himself; and so great 
a variety of the natives of the forest has, perhaps, never been collected in 
so small a place. In 1794 he paid his first visit to London, where he 
formed an acquaintance with Professor Martyn, of Cambridge, author of 
the valuable additions to Miller's Dictionary; Dr. Shaw, the zoologist ; 
Mr. Dickson, of Covent Garden, the celebrated cryptogamist ; and Mr. 
Whitley, an eminent nursery-man, from whom he afterwards purchased 
many plants, and with whom he corresponded. In 1795 he became 
acquainted with the late Mr. Arbuckle, collector of Donaghadee; and 
through him, with the Earl of Clanbrassil. This nobleman, much attached 
to the study of botanj^ had Mr. Templeton frequently with him at Bryans- 
ford, and near Dundalk j on which occasions he usually accompanied Mr, 



406 Biography : ¦— John Templeio7i, Esq, 

Arbuckle, with whom he carried on a frequent correspondence for some 
years. These visits were only terminated by the death of Lord Clanbrassil, 
in 1798. In 1796 Mr. Templeton paid a second visit to London, where 
he was introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, who took great notice of him ; and 
then, or soon after, made him an offer to go to New Holland, with a salary 
of 3 or 400/. a year, and a large grant of land ; but his attachment to his 
aunt and sisters, with whom he lived before his marriage, as well as to his 
native country, made him decline it, though the prospect it held out of 
prosecuting his favourite study was very tempting. Mr. Brown, the distin- 
guished author of the Prodromus of the Plants of New Holland^ who went 
to New Holland afterwards, was in the number of Mr. Templeton's friends 
and correspondents ; and expressed his sense of the services rendered by 
Mr. Templeton to botany, by appropriating the name Templetoma to one 
of his new genera. He also became acquainted with Doctor, now Sir J. 
E. Smith, president of the Linnean Society, the Rev. Dr. Goodenough, 
late Bishop of Carlisle, with Aylmer Bourke Lambert, Esq., author of a 
splendid and valuable work on the genus Pinus, Mr.Sowerby, Mr. Curtis, 
and others, besides renewing his acquaintance with Dr. Shaw and Mr. 
Dickson; and with many of these he afterwards corresponded. Lord 
Clanbrassil was in London at that time, and Mr. Templeton's letters show 
that he enjoyed his visit much, though glad to return to his domestic occu- 
pations. Previously to this visit, he had made some communications to the 
Linnean Society, which were well received. One of them was on the 
migration of birds, and another on soils. In the year 1799 he commu- 
nicated to the Royal Irish Academy, through the Bishop of Clonfert, Dr. 
Young, with whom he was intimate, a paper on the naturalisation of 
plants, a subject to which he had devoted much attention. In this he urged 
the necessity of experiments. " The same Almighty hand," he says, " that 
formed the earth, has scattered, in far distant regions, vegetables, which the 
necessity or luxury of man excites him to endeavour to accumulate about 
his home. And if we, at the present time, survey the different nations of 
the earth, we shall find that most of them have received great and im- 
portant benefits by the introduction of foreign plants ; and that there is 
no country, however numerous its collection of plants, but may yet receive 
considerable advantages by the naturalisation of others." 

This paper contains many excellent practical observations which have 
been referred to in different works published since that time. I shall at 
present quote only one. " By the appearance of the roots and leaves, we 
may nearly determine in what kind of soil the plant is most likely to thrive. 
Robust roots and fleshy or rigid leaves require a dry soil, according to 
their thickness, stiff clay or sandy loam, as beans, peach trees, and apple 
trees : robust spongy roots which have a tendency to mat near the surface, 
with thin leaves, as the alder (^1nus\ willows (5alix), require a somewhat 
stiffer soil with moisture ; many of the ^alix genus will not grow with their 
accustomed vigour in a light turf or peat mould soil, for want of the 
necessary resistance to the root, although suitable in respect to moisture. 
Slender, hard, and wiry roots as those of the pine, cistus, &c., require dry, 
sandy, or gravelly soils, and extremely fine and hair-like roots, as those of 
£rica, Kdlmia, /Rhododendron, &c., nmst have a soil whose particles will not 
impede the shooting of their tender fibres, and with a small but regular 
degree of moisture, that the roots, which by their form cannot resist the 
slightest drought, may not be destroyed. Plants in a warm climate perspire 
more than in a cold one ; so in a warm one they require much, and in a 
cold one little moisture. Therefore when transplanted from a warm to a 
cold climate, they should have a drier soil, and from a colder to a warmer, 
a moistcr one than in their native station."

blem. By some, the increase of weight has been supposed to proceed from 
the quantity of water dissolved in the air; this is, however, refuted by the 
simple fact, that when the mercury stands highest, the air is most dry ; and, 
on the contrary, rain generally occurs when the atmosphere is light." What 
is meant by the words " most dry ; " is it meant that the air is then freest 
from water, or do they signify, only, that it is then most desiccating ? An

Too great Humanity to Animals. — Sir, Having, this week, received a curious 
sort of letter of censure for my too great humanity, I enclose it to you, that 
you may, if you please, make use of it. It is, perhaps, scarcely deserving of 
notice ; but, as I have understood that you like some discussion upon the 
various subjects treated in the past Numbers of the Magazine, I thought you 
might like to insert it; I send it, therefore, with some remarks in answer; 
but, pray, do not scruple to throw both aside, if you think it better to do so. 

" Madam, — Having read, in the Magazine of Natural History, a com- 
munication from you, entitled, ' Considerations on Botany, as a Study for 
Young People,' wherein you recommended its pursuit over the other col- 
lateral branches, inasmuch as it was not fraught with cruelty, and that, in its 
prosecution, you are without the fear of inflicting pain. Now, as an expe- 
rimental physiologist, I should beg to give it as my opinion, that the lower 
class of animals are not susceptible of the sensation o\ pain. This seems to 
be dependent upon the tardiness of their circulating systems, and conse- 
quent want of nervous energy. First, I should like to state to you, that the 
common eft can have its tail removed without even being conscious of it. In 
man, and the vertebratae, the seat of sensation is chiefly found in the brain; 
but how different in insects. It is a known fact, that the head of most in- 
sects can be removed, and the animal possess the power to perform all the 
functions, save seeing and eating, and ultimately only dies of inanition. I 
am not at all an advocate for deliberate crudty, but it seems to me that, 
on this subject, there exists an unnecessary and false feeling amongst your 
enchanting sex. A lady can read the account of a cool and deliberate blood- 



408 Notices, 

shed of some hundreds of fellow-beings, and call the perpetrator a hero; and 
yet the man \yho, from a love of, and earnest wish to improve, science, kills 
a few insects, is only known by the undeserving epithets of a brute, monster, 
or cruel wretch ! With every wish that you may conquer your present 
fastidiousness, I have the honour to be, Madam, yours — A Follower of 
JEsculapius. Aug. 8. 1828." 

In reading this letter, it is very easy to perceive that the writer is one of, 
what he himself considers, the higher class of animals ; and so far, perhaps, 
we may agree with him, whatever may be the opinion of what we term the 
lower class, on this subject. The wasp, when it stings us, may choose to 
believe that we are not susceptible of pain ; it might be convenient to him 
to think so, if he desired to repeat the sting; and I know not that we have 
any better reason for arrogating all the pain to ourselves, than the insect 
would have for denying that we felt anj/. A man may have his nails or his 
hair cut, without experiencing any pain from the operation, but does it fol- 
low thence that he is insensible to pain ? Even allowing that the head or 
tail of an animal may be removed, without depriving it of tlie powers of 
motion, &:c., can we, therefore, affirm that it is done without pain ? Or 
supposing the seat of sensation, in insects, not to be in the head, can we 
then say, that it does not exist at all ? Even admitting the fact, that the 
head be removed without pain, is it nothing to deprive the poor insect 
of sight, and of the means of supporting its Ufe ? Is it nothing to leave it 
to die of hunger? Whatever may be our theories on such subjects, what- 
ever the analogies, or arguments upon which we found them, it is dangerous 
to act upon opinions that we cannot prove ; and surely it is better ever> to 
run into a little excess on the humane side of the question, than to run the 
risk of inflicting unnecessary pain. 

I agree with the writer that " she who can read the account of a cool and 
deliberate bloodshed of some hundreds of fellow-creatures, and call the 
perpetrator a hero," yet calls him a brute, and a monster, who, for useful 
purposes, " kills a few insects*^ is merely squeamish ; and perhaps a little af- 
fected ; but let us hope that women will ever preserve that " fastidiousness," 
if fastidiousness it be, which shrinks from inflicting pain on any living crea- 
ture. If an animal must suffer death, let it be given without torture ; and, 
above all, let us not make the sufferings of any creature, however low its 
rank in the creation, a source of heartless sport. I suspect this disciple of 
iEsculapius is far from being heartless, and that his quickness to correct me 
in this matter, proceeds from a tenderness of conscience, awakened to a 
doubt he does not fully acknowledge to himself. In return for his anxiety 
for my own improvement, I sincerely hope that he will listen to his feelings 
as well as to his wishes, and not suffer his convictions to depend upon his 
will.— Yours, &c. E. Kent. Aug. 15. 1828.

\ Art. I. Remarks on the present State of Natural History in 
Germany, By W. J. 

From the time that Germany, now ruled by so many princes 
who love and favour art, was freed from the yoke of Napoleon, 
it has been rapidly advancing in science. The natural sciences, 
in particular, have been cultivated with great zeal; and we 
shall not be far from the truth, if we assert that it was by the 
very agitation of the period alluded to, when Paris had also 
become the capital of Germany, that the great progress which 
these sciences have made was accelerated. The German is a 
collector by nature ; and in almost every city of moderate size, 
a collection of some sort may be found, belonging to some 
private inhabitant or scholar. During the sway of the French, 
many learned men from Germany had occasion to go to Paris, 
where they were inspired with a noble emulation on beholding 
the splendid collections that have been made in that city since 
the time of Buffon. Before the revolution, Linnaeus, and the 
phlogistic school of chemistry, reigned triumphant in Germany. 
The antiphlogistic chemistry (the father of which, Lavoisier, 
fell himself a victim to revolutionary violence) was afterwards 
embraced in Germany with great zeal. Priestley, and a 
number of other discoverers, contributed to the application 
of the new chemical views of physiology ; and thus, in Ger- 
many, the scene was completely changed in the beginning of 
the nineteenth century. The incomparable Werner enlarged 
mineralogy; and his school, spreading from Freiberg over the 
whole world, gave to his views an almost canonical authority : 
but, as the Germans prefer truth to personal considerations, 
this great man had the mortification of seeing Raumer, and 
others of his pupils in the neighbourhood of Freiberg, dis- 
covering facts and relations in direct opposition to his system, 
Rome de Lisle's experiments in crystallography did not meet

410 Remarks on the present State of 

with much encouragement in Germany, but Hauy soon after 
found many adherents ; and StefFens, who tried to unite his views 
with those of Werner ; Leonard, who modelled the terminology 
after the French ; and others, attracted great attention towards 
the French doctrine. Mohs and Weiss introduced a new and 
more active life into mineralogy : the former, by pursuing, in a 
certain measure, the track of his teacher, Werner; and the 
latter, by the enlargement of crystallography, and by bringing 
it, through the application of numbers, into affinity with the 
calculating chemistry of Berzelius. Fuchs unites the views of 
the crystallographers with that of the chemical constitution of 
minerals, in order to arrive at a scientific unity in mineralogy. 
In botany, the doctrines of Linnaeus had for a long time 
been maintained in Germany, although several Germans pro- 
duced various new systems; such as Heister, the predecessor 
of Jussieu, who had made good use of his labours; and Biitt- 
ner. It was not till the middle of the last century, that the 
study of the natural families of plants began to be zealously 
pursued ; at which period the Germans had, by means of cor- 
respondence, travels, &c., begun to obtain possession of larger 
collections of plants. Voigt translated Richard's treatise on 
fruits, and reduced Jussieu's method into a tabular form ; and 
Sprengel gave popular lectures on the doctrine of the natural 
famihes of plants, in 1817. The great poet Goethe also con- 
tributed his share, by means of a little book, long overlooked, 
in which he attempted, with the acumen of a true naturalist, 
to reduce the principles of vegetation to simple laws, and to 
explain, in a general manner, the various phenomena of appa- 
rently different organs. In consequence of Goethe's views, 
which were continued by others, the Germans felt themselves 
powerfully attracted to the necessity of considering the organs 
of plants, according to their metamorphoses ; and they now 
speak in botany of a morphology, which may otherwise be 
termed organography viewed in the light of all changes of 
phenomena appearing in the leaf. Ever since Hedwig, the 
founder of muscology, and of Persoon, the founder of my- 
cology, a great inclination has been observable among the 
Germans for the study of the Cryptogamia. This study be- 
came, as it were, the key to higher views, by making its fol- 
lowers acquainted with the simplest parts of the organs of 
plants. Nees von Esenbeck entered into the examination of 
mushrooms in a morphological sense, and the result of his 
labours, notwithstanding his numerous theoretical speculations, 
excited, by the soundness of his views, an interest for such 
dehcate and difficult investigations. Link, Roper, and E. 
Meyer pursued the road pointed out by Goethe : particularly 



Natural History in Germany, ^l\ 

the first, whose views were peculiar to hims'elf; and Von 
Martins, who sought the metamorphosis of the leaf in its 
evolution round the axis of the plant, and endeavoured 
to explain, from this circumstance, the variety of flowers. 
Cotta, Meyer, and Gaertner have done much in the physio- 
logy of plants, with respect to the history of vegetation, the 
functions of the organs, fructification, and anomalous pro- 
ductions ; in which Gaertner, the son of the great carpologist, 
repeated and extended Kalkbrenner's experiments. The dis- 
coveries of the Germans in phytotomy are very considerable. 
Sprengel, Link, Rudolphi, Moldenhauer, and Treviranus have 
collected and observed with great industry, and Kiefer has 
united the different facts into the most comprehensive system. 
The geography of plants also, which originated with Hum- 
boldt, is now diligently cultivated ; and the descriptive works, 
among which that of Kunth is the largest and most meritorious, 
contribute not a little to place this science on a sure foundation. 

Zoology has been pursued according to the system of Cuvier, 
who, having received his education in Germany, has become 
the teacher and guide of the many Germans who visit 
Paris. Zoology and zootomy are so closely united, that, in 
most universities, they are taught by one and the same pro- 
fessor. The celebrated veterans, Sommerring and Blumen- 
bach, have excellent disciples in this branch in Bojanus, 
Tiedemann, Otto, Weber, Rudolphi, &c., who diligently in- 
vestigate not only the larger animals, but also the minute zoo- 
phytes of the sea, &c. The view of natural families in animated 
nature, first proposed by Illiger, has been introduced into 
zoology through zootomy. Meigen, Gravenhorst, Tiedemann, 
and Ochsenheimer have done much in the branch of insects ; 
and Klug, by his unwearied industry, has become the German, 
Latreille. Von Bar, of Konigsberg, is a zealous observer of 
the inferior animals. The cabinets of Vienna and Berlin have 
been so much enlarged, that, in some respects, they outrival 
that of Paris. The mineralogical collections also, as well as 
the botanical gardens of Vienna, Berlin, Munich, and Gcittin- 
gen, display riches which, twenty years ago, could hardly be 
met with in Europe, except in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris. 

Upon the whole, it is pleasing to contemplate, in a country 
so various in its forms of government and religion, the zeal 
for the investigation of nature so universally diffused, and not, 
as in France, limited to one capital ; and to observe the pro- 
gressive advancement of science. It forms a picture of the 
intellectual improvement of man, which, in spite of all obstacles, 
verifies the old saying of Plus ultra I

Art. II. On Juvenile Museums, with an Account of a Boys 
Herbarium. By J. Rennie, A.M. 

All children appear to be more or less fond of natural 
history, from their earliest years; and, were this natural pro- 
pensity duly encouraged, an extensive acquaintance with natural 
productions might be obtained by young people, at little or no 
trouble or expense to their parents, and with great pleasure 
and interest to themselves. The three most obvious depart- 
ments best adapted for this purpose are, botany, conchology, 
and mineralogy, and particularly the first. I do not speak 
upon conjecture or speculation ; I can adduce more than one 
case in which I have seen such plans carried into effect, with 
a success far surpassing the most sanguine expectations that 
could have been previously formed ; and, as particular ex- 
amples are more apt to attract attention than vague or general 
remarks, I shall, as an illustration of my views, give a brief 
history of what has been, and may be, done in this way. 

Account of a Jiwenile Het^barium. 

A boy, who is now eight years old, began, at the age of five, 
to collect plants, for the purpose of drying them, to form a 
little herbarium ; but it may be necessary to state that he pre- 
viously knew, by memory, the scientific names of many of our 
more common wild and garden plants, some of which names, 
indeed, were amongst the first words he had been taught to 
speak. It was in winter when he first commenced his herba- 
rium ; and this was so far an advantage, that the evergreens, 
such as i^lex, //edera, ^iixus, &c., as well as mosses, parti- 
cularly the larger //ypna and Dicrana, are more easily dried 
than the succulent plants of summer ; besides, they require less 
nicety in spreading and arranging the foliage and branchlets, 
which is the most difficult thing for a child so young as this 
to manage dexterously, so as to display the characters of a 
plant in the specimen. 

The method pursued was, to lay the specimens evenly 
between sheets of thick blotting-paper, of the folio size, over 
which were placed a number of large books. The specimens 
were shifted every day, either into fresh jxiper, or into a dry 
part of the same sheet, to prevent moulding and rotting ; and 
this daily operation of shifting the specimens, was always 
looked forward to with as much delight as to a iioliday, or any 
other treat of juvenile interest. At the same time, it renewed 
acquaintance with the specimens, and served to fix their names 
in the memory by reiteration. There was another source of 
interest, however, which I must not overlook ; the boy was not 
alone in his study, if I may be permitted to call it so. 



On Juvenile Museums, 415 



The sister of our juvenile botanist is 18 months younger 
than he ; and, at the time he began his collection, was little 
more than three years of age. Accustomed to imitate her 
brother in most things, the little girl begged to have some 
blotting-paper for her tiny specimens ; and accordingly she 
had some given her, of an octavo size, as more easily managed. 
The reader will scarcely believe that the specimens, dried 
without assistance, by this child of three years of age, would 
not disgrace any herbarium in the empire; yet her little col- 
lection, consisting of several hundred plants, native and culti- 
vated, is in existence to prove the fact. 

These two children spent, and now spend, many a delighted 
hour in examining, arranging, or adding to their little collec- 
tions : thus gaining a practical acquaintance with the works of 
nature, while other children are, to say the least, not so use« 
fully or pleasantly employed. Out of doors, still more, their 
collection employs them, in active search for specimens, in all 
the fields within their reach. It is not to be supposed, how- 
ever, that they could have done all this without being carefully 
directed, and their attention turned to what appeared likely 
to interest them: in this their mother was very assiduous; 
but as they have just been deprived of her by consumption, 
they have now lost their chief guide in forming habits of 
observation. 

It is proposed that they shall next begin little collections 
of minerals and shells, as soon as appropriate boxes, drawers, 
&c., shall be constructed for their reception. An account of 
their proceedings in these departments, shall be furnished on 
some future occasion, as it may serve to stimulate others to 
follow their example. In the mean time, it may not be amiss 
to mention one method of making boxes for shells, &c. 

Juvenile Cabinet for Shells, 

In one of Miss Edgeworth's delightful little books for young 
people (I forget which), there is an account of a pasteboard 
tray, furnished with divisions, fitted to hold shells, &c., ar- 
ranged according to their genera and species. As this is pre- 
cisely what young people want, to give them habits of order 
and arrangement, such trays ought to be given them, or they 
may (as in the case of Miss Edgeworth's young friends) be 
taught to construct the trays themselves. The method of doing 
this may be found in an excellent little work, lately translated 
from the German, entitled the Arl ofnsoorking in Pasteboard^ 
which, with its companion volume, the Papyro-plastics, or the 
Art of working in Paper, ought to be in the hands of all juve^. 
nile naturalists ; for, next to the pleasure of collecting in tlie

fields, is the pleasure of seeing specimens preserved neatly and 
in good order ; and nothing is better fitted for this than paste- 
board boxes.

Art. III. Sketches of Tvoenty-four American Song Birds. 
By J. Rennie, A.m. 

It was promised, in a recent Number (p. 347.)5 to disprove 
the opinion of Buflfbn, which has grown into a prejudice 
pretty generally diffused, that the birds of America are inferior 
in song to those of Europe ; because, says the eloquent but 
credulous and mistaken naturaHst, by living in a savage coun- 
try, their voices become harsh and unmusical. But, before 
coming to particulars, I may be permitted to enquire, since 
birds sing in a pitch so irregular, and with intervals so un- 
settled, exhibiting a total disregard to measure and rhythm, 
what makes their music pleasing ? The cause has been traced 
to association, for they seldom sing but in fine weather and 
when pleased ; and, for the last reason, even the sostenuto of 
the cat is not unpleasing. The variety and rapidity of their 
notes and intonation also awaken attention ; and the contrast 
between rapid flights of double-demi-semi-quavers, and length- 
ened and sweet minims, is often wonderful ; such as the soft 
and sustained notes of the nightingale, succeeded by a short 
and expressive .passage of quicker sound. It is perhaps too 
much to say, that we have borrowed all our music from birds, 
but some of it is evidently a plagiarism: for instance, the 
following German waltz : — 

riageolet.

The cuckoo itself has clone more for our music than musi- 
cians maybe willing to allow; but it is no more than justice to 
a despised bird to say, that from it we have derived the 7ninor 
scale, whose origin has puzzled so many ; the cuckoo's couplet 
being the mifior third sung downwards : thus, 



¦^-< 



Of the American song birds, the genus Turdus seems to 
hold the chief rank, there being at least four species distin- 
guished for their notes, among which is the Mocking-bird ; to 
whose unrivalled music I shall presently advert, after disposing 
of his less distinguished congeners ; none of which, be it re- 
membered, belong to our European species. I must also 
premise that I am indebted to Wilson, the ingenious author 
of the Ame7'ican Ornithology, for almost all the details. 

The Brown Thrush (Turdus rufus), sometimes called the 
Thrasher, or French Mocking-bird, is the largest of the 
genus. His song is loud, emphatic, and full of variety ; and, 
in a serene morning, when the wind is hushed, and before the 
" busy hum of men " begins, his voice may be distinguished 
at the distance of half a mile. His notes are not imitative, as 
some have erroneously supposed, but are wholly his own, and 
bear a very considerable resemblance to those of the European 
song thrush (Turdus musicus). 

The Migratory, or Red-breasted, Thrush ( Turdus migrato- 
rius) is an early songster, frequently commencing in March, 
before the snow has disappeared. One or two individuals 
usually taking the lead, by leaving the flock and perching on 
a stake or fence, to begin the prelude to the general concert. 
His song is not a bad imitation of the notes of the preceding 
( T. rufus) : but, though inferior to the brown thrush in execu- 
tion, it is more simple, and what is deficient in talent is amply 
made up in zealous enthusiasm ; so that his song is universally 
liked ; and he is often, on that account, kept in cages. 

The Wood Thrush (Turdus melodus) is a sweet and soli- 
tary songster. He chooses his station, at dawn, on the top 
of a tall tree, that rises from a low, thick, shaded part of the 
woods, piping his clear musical notes in a kind of ecstasy, the 
prelude or symphony to which strongly resembles the double- 
tonguing of a German flute, and sometimes the tinkling of a 
small bell. The whole song consists of five or six parts, the 
last note of each of which is in a tone that leaves the conclu-

to 



sion suspended. The finale is beautifully managed, with so 
fine an effect as to appear sweeter and mellower at each suc- 
cessive repetition. Rival songsters, in different parts of a 
wood, seem to vie with each other in the softness of their 
tones, and the exquisite finish of their responses. During the 
heat of the day they are comparatively mute, but they renew 
their song at the close of day, and continue it long after sun- 
set. Even in dark gloomy weather, during May and June, 
when scarce a chirp is heard from any other bird, the wood 
thrush sings from morn till night; and it may be said with jus- 
tice, that the sadder the day the sweeter is his song. Those 
who have paid attention to the singing of birds know well that 
their voice, energy, and expression differ as widely as in man ; 
and, agreeably to this remark, Wilson says he was so familiar 
with the notes of an individual wood thrush, that he could 
recognise him from all his fellows the moment he entered the 
woods. 

The Mocking-bird {Junius polyglottus) seems to be the 
prince of all song birds, being altogether unrivalled in the 
extent and variety of his vocal powers ; and, besides the fulness 
and melody of liis original notes, he has the faculty of imi- 
tating the notes of all other birds, from the humming-bird to 
the eagle. Pennant tells us that he heard a caged one, in 
England, imitate the mewing of a cat and the creaking of a 
sign in high winds. The Hon. Daines Harrington says his 
pipe comes the nearest to our nightingale, of any bird he ever 
heard. The description, however, given by Wilson, in his 
own inimitable manner, as far excels Pennant and Harrington 
as the bird excels his fellow-songsters. Wilson tells that the 
ease, elegance, and rapidity of his movements, the animation 
of his eye, and the intelligence he displays in listening and 
laying up lessons, mark the peculiarity of his genius. His 
voice is full, strong, and musical, and capable of almost every 
modulation, from the clear mellow tones of the wood thrush 
to the savage scream of the bald eagle. In measure and 
accents lie faithfully follows his originals, while in force 
and sweetness of expression he greatly improves upon them. 
In his native woods, on a dewy morning, his song rises 
above every competitor, lor the others seem merely as in- 
ferior accompaniments. His own notes are bold and full, 
and varied seemingly beyond all limits. They consist of 
short expressions of two, three, or at most five or six, sylla- 
bles, generally expressed with great eni})hasis and rapidity, 
and continued with undiminished ardour, for half an hour or 
an hour at a time. While singing, he expands his wings and 
his tiiil, glistening with white, keeping lime to his own music. 



American Song Birds, 417 

and the buoyant gaiety of his action is no less fascinating than 
his song. He sweeps round with enthusiastic ecstasy, he 
mounts and descends as his song swells or dies away ; he 
bounds aloft, as Bartram says, with the celerity of an arrow, 
as if to recover or recal his very soul, expired in the last ele- 
vated strain. A bystander might suppose that the whole 
feathered tribes had assembled together on a trial of skill ; 
each striving to produce his utmost effect, so perfect are his 
imitations. He often deceives the sportsman, and even birds 
themselves are sometimes imposed upon by this admirable 
mimic. In confinement he loses little of the power or energy 
of his song. He whistles for the dog; Caesar starts up, wags 
his tail, and runs to meet his master. He cries like a hurt 
chicken, and the hen hurries about, with feathers on end, to 
protect her injured brood. He repeats the tune taught him, 
though it be of considerable length, with great accuracy. He 
runs over the notes of the canary, and of the red bird, with 
such superior execution and effect, that the mortified songsters 
confess his triumph by their silence. His fondness for variety, 
some suppose to injure his song. His imitations of the brown 
thrush are often interrupted by the crow ing of cocks ; and his 
exquisite warblings after the blue bird, are mingled with the 
screaming of swallows, or the cackling of hens. During moon- 
light, both in the wild and tame state, he sings the whole night 
long. The hunters, in their night excursions, know that the 
moon is rising the instant they begin to hear his delightful 
solo. After Shakspeare, Barrington attributes in part the 
exquisiteness of the nightingale's song to the silence of the 
night ; but if so, what are we to think of the bird which, in 
the open glare of day, overpowers and often silences all com- 
petition ? His natural notes partake of a character similar to 
those of the brown thrush, but they are more sweet, more ex- 
pressive, more varied, and uttered with greater rapidity. Mr. 
Jennings is so eager to make his readers believe that " during 
the day its chief notes consist of the imitations of the songs of 
its neighbours, while at night its song is more peculiarly its 
own," that he has repeated it in three several places of his 
Ornitholbgia. I must say that to me this has more the air of 
conjecture than of fact. 

The Yellow-breasted Chat (Pipra polyglotta) naturally fol- 
lows his superior in the art of mimicry. When his haunt is 
approached, he scolds the passenger in a great variety of odd 
and uncouth monosyllables, difficult to describe, but easily 
imitated so as to deceive the bird himself, and draw him after 
you to a good distance ; in such cases his responses are con- 
stant and rapid, strongly expressive of anxiety and anger, and

while the bird is always unseen, the voice shifts from place to 
place among the bushes, as if proceeding from a spirit. At 
first are heard short notes like the whisthngof a duck's wings, 
beginning loud and rapid, and becoming lower and slower, till 
they end in detached notes. There succeeds something like 
the barking of young puppies, followed by a variety of guttural 
sounds, like those of some quadrupeds, and ending like the 
mewing of a cat, but much hoarser. All those are given with 
much vehemence, and in different keys, so as to appear some- 
times at a great distance, and instantly again quite near you. 
In mild serene moonlight nights, it continues this ventrilo- 
quism all night, responding to its own echoes. 

The song of the Baltimore Oriole (Oriolus baltimorus) is 
little less remarkable than his fine appearance, and the inge- 
nuity with which he builds his nest. His notes consist of a 
clear mellow whistle, repeated at short intervals as he gleams 
among the branches. There is in it a certain wild plaintive- 
ness and naivete extremely interesting. It is not uttered with 
rapidity, but with the pleasing tranquillity of a careless plough- 
boy, whistling for amusement. Since the streets of some of 
the American towns have been planted with Lombardy pop- 
lars, the orioles are constant visitors, chaunting their native 
" wood notes wild," amid the din of coaches, wheelbarrows, 
and sometimes within a few yards of a bawling oysterwoman. 

The notes of the Orchard Oriole (Oriolus mutatus) are nei- 
ther so full nor so mellow as those of the Baltimore, and are 
uttered more rapidly and gaily, while the bird is flying and 
caroling in a hurried manner, so that the ear can seldoni catch 
all the tones. Among these there is one note especially which 
is very striking and interesting. 

The Virginian Nightingale, Red Bird, or Cardinal Gros- 
beak (Loxia cardinalis), has great clearness, variety, and 
melody in his notes, many of which resemble the higher notes 
of a fife, and are nearly as loud. He sings from March till 
September, and begins early in the dawn, repeating a favourite 
stanza twenty or thirty times successively, and often for a whole 
morning together, till, Uke a good story too frequently re- 
peated, it becomes quite tiresome. He is very sprighdy, and 
full of vivacity ; yet his notes are much inferior to those of the 
wood, or even of the brown, thrush. 

Another bird of this genus, the Pine Grosbeak (Loxia 
enucleator), sings extremely clear, mellow, and sweet, though 
not so loud as birds of its size generally do. A tame one sung, 
during the months of May {uid June, with much enthusiasm, 
for whole mornings together; and it acquired several notes 
of the Virginian nightingale, one of which hung near it. 



American Song Birds. 419 

The American Goldfinch, or Yellow Bird (Fringilla tristis), 
sings very much like the European goldfinch ; but so weakly, 
that, even when perched over your head, the notes appear to 
come from a distance. In a cage he sings with great energy 
and animation. They are migratory birds ; and, when they 
arrive in spring, great numbers of them assemble on the same 
tree, to bask and dress themselves in the morning sun, sing- 
ing at the same time, in concert, most delightfully, for half an 
hour together. 

The Indigo Bird (Fringilla cyanea) is fond of perching on 
fences about road-sides, and is a vigorous and pretty good 
songster ; mounting to the tops of the highest trees, and 
chaunting for half an hour at a time. His song is a repetition 
of short notes, commencing loud and rapid, and falling by 
imperceptible gradations, till they seem hardly articulate, as if 
the little minstrel were quite exhausted. After a pause of 
about half a minute, he begins as before. Unlike most other 
birds, he chaunts with as much animation under the meridian 
sun in June as he does in a May morning. 

The Song Sparrow (i^ringilla meloda) is by far the earliest, 
sweetest, and most unwearied of the American song birds, 
sometimes continuing in song during the whole year. His 
note, or rather chaunt, is short but very sweet ; somewhat 
resembling the beginning of the canary's song, frequently 
repeated for an hour together. 

The whole song of the Black-throated Bunting (Emberiza 
americana) consists of five, or rather two, notes ; the first re- 
peated twice and very slowly, the third thrice and rapidly, 
resembling chip-chip, che-che-che ; of which ditty he is by no 
means parsimonious, but will continue it for hours successively. 
His manners are much like those of the European yellow- 
hammer, sitting, while he sings, on palings and low bushes. 

The song of the Rice Bird (Emberiza oryzivora) is highly 
musical. Mounting and hovering on the wing, at a small 
height above the ground, he chaunts out a jingling melody of 
varied notes, as if half a dozen birds were singing together. 
Some idea may be formed of it, by striking the high keys of a 
piano-forte singly and quickly, making as many contrasts as 
possible, of high and low notes. Many of the tones are de- 
lightful, but the ear can with difficulty separate them. The 
general effect of the whole is good ; and when ten or twelve 
are singing on the same tree, the concert is singularly pleasing. 

The Scarlet Tanager (Tanagra rubra) has a pensive mono- 
tonous note, like chip, churr, which appears distant, though 
the bird be near. At times he has a more musical chaunt 
something like that of the Baltimore oriole. He is none of 



420 American Song Birds. 

the meanest of the American songsters, and his plumage 
renders him a striking ornament to the woodland scenery. 

The note of the Summer Red Bird (Tanagra aestiva) is a 
strong sonorous whisde, resembling a loose trill, or shake, on 
the notes of a fife, frecjuently repeated. That of the female 
is rather a kind of chattering, like a rapid enunciation of 
ch ickey-tuckey-tuch. 

The Shore Lark (^auda alpestris, or A, cornuta) has a 
single chirp, exactly like the European skylark ; and it is 
reported that, in the country where it breeds, it sings well 
while mounting in the air. 

The Maryland Yellow Throat (Sylvia marylandica) has a 
twitter not disagreeable, somewhat like "jchitttitee, thrice re- 
peated ; after which it pauses for half a minute, and begins 
again the same ditty. 

The Red-eyed Flycatcher (Sylvia olivacea) has a loud, 
lively, and energetic song, which is continued sometimes for 
an hour without intermission. The notes are, in short, em- 
phatic bars of two, three, or four syllables. On listening to 
this bird, in his full ardour of song, it requires but little ima- 
gination to fancy you hear the words " Tom Kelly I whip ! 
Tom Kelly ! " very distinctly ; and hence Tom Kelly is the 
name given to the bird in the West Indies. 

The White-eyed Flycatcher (Muscicapa cantatrix) is a 
lively, active, sociable, little bird, possessing a strong voice 
for its size, and a great variety of notes, singing with much 
vivacity from April to September. 

The Crested Titmouse (Parus bi color) possesses a remark- 
able variety in the tones of its voice, at one time not louder 
than the squeaking of a mouse, and in a moment after whistling 
aloud and clearly, as if calling a dog, and continuing this dog- 
call through the woods for half an hour at a time. 

The Red-breasted Blue Bird (Sylvia sialis) has a soft, 
aoreeable, and often repeated warble, uttered with opening 
and quivering wings. In his courtship he uses the tenderest 
expressions, and caresses his mate by sitting close by her, and 
singing his most endearing warblings. If a rival appears, he 
attacks him with fury, and, having driven him away, returns 
to pour out a song of triumph. In autumn his song changes 
to a simple plaintive note, which is heard in open weather all 
winter, though in severe weather the bird is never to be seen. 

The Marsh Wren (Certhia palustris) can scarcely be said 
to sino" ; but, when standing on the reedy banks of the Dela- 
ware or Schuylkill in June, you may hear a low crackling 
sound, as of air bubbles forcing their way through mud or

boggy ground when it is trod upon. These are the singular 
notes oT the marsh wren. 

The notes of the House Wren (Motacilla domestica) are 
loud, sprightly, and tremulous, repeated every few seconds 
with great animation, with a trilling vivacity extremely agree- 
able. The European who judges of the song of this species 
by that of his own wren (iVfotacilla troglodytes), will do great 
injustice to the American bird ; for, in strength of tone and 
execution, the house wren is far superior. He may be heard 
on the tops of houses, even in towns, singing with great energy. 

From these twenty-four examples, I think the position is 
fully made out, that the American song birds, so far from 
being inferior, are superior, to those of Europe, both in number 
and in the excellence of their music. I hope, therefore, that 
we shall hear no more of the untenable theories of BufFon 
upon this subject.

Art. IV. Description and Hist or u of some of the principal British 
Insects : — Terminology, By A. J. N. 



Sir. 



In complying with your request to furnish you with the 
natural history of some of the most important of our native 
insects, you must allow me to premise that my knowledge of 
insects has not been obtained from museums and books of 
plates, but from nearly half a century's observations in the 
open air as a farmer and gardener, assisted but by few other 
works than those of Linnaeus. I shall not therefore trouble 
your readers with theories of classification, nor swell your 
pages with discussions on the recent innovations in nomen- 
clature, but confine myself to those genera and species, which, 
being known to almost every body, have names in current use 
in general language. I shall always give the scientific names 
and the orders of Linnaeus, and merely add one or two of the 
modern synonymes of the greatest authority among entomo- 
logists. 

Insects (from i?isectus, cut or notched, Lat.), as Dr. Johnson 
informs us, are so called from a separation in the middle 
of their bodies, whereby they are cut into two parts, joined 
by a small ligature, as in the common fly. The history 
and description of insects constitute the science of ento- 
mology, a term formed from the two Greek words, entoma, 
insects, and logos, a discourse. Entomology is one of the 
principal branches of the study of natural history ; and, though 



422 Principal British Insects : — Terminology, 

neglected or despised by the generality of mankind, as a' 
pursuit of too trifling a character to engage the attention of a 
rational mind, yet, as has been wisely said of it, " the 
Creator, the more to illustrate his wisdom, power, and skill, 
has decreed that the minuter animals shall be more complex, 
in all respects, than the mighty monarchs of the forest or the 
flood." 

When we contemplate the infinite number, variety, and 
formation of insects, consider their transmutations, economy, 
and powers, attend to their qualities, their utility or injury to 
mankind, and their important place in completing the chain of 
animated nature, we are filled with wonder and astonishment. 
The structure of these little beings, their various functions 
and curious manners, are of the most interesting description. 
Their instincts, for their own preservation or that of their 
progeny, almost exceed belief; and their ravages on the 
works of man, and on the objects of his care, are the imme- 
diate causes of vigilance on his part, which ultimately operates 
to his benefit in a great variety of ways. Many who have 
never had either opportunity or inclination to enter on the 
study of insects, may feel something like surprise when they 
learn that, besides being the plagues, and sometimes the minis- 
ters of vengeance, to humble the pride, and punish the indo- 
lence or ingratitude of man, they also supply the gorgeous 
habiliments of princes, the rallying ensigns of heroes, and the. 
Tyrian dye for sacerdotal and magisterial vestments. From 
them are derived increments to the healing art, as well as to 
diet; and, above all, some of the lowest orders of these puny 
tribes, have even the power to change some of the features of 
the earth itself. 

Before proceeding to the description of any insect, it is 
necessary to explain the terminology made use of by ento- 
mologists. I shall confine myself at present to terms of 
most frequent occurrence, and explain such others as I may 
find occasion to introduce, as they occur. Insects form the 
fifth class of the Linnean system of animated nature, the first, 
second, third, fourth, and sixth classes being quadrupeds, 
birds, amphibious animals, fishes, and worms. Insects are 
furnished with legs, a distinct head, and with horns or anten- 
nae, which are supposed to be their organs of smell ; they 
respire through pores in various parts of their body, but it is 
not certain that they respire through their mouths ; they are, 
for the most part, oviparous. The greater number pass 
through three stages of existence ; the egg or embryo state, the 
larva or caterpillar state, and the imago or perfect state: 
some, in their imago state, are only partially changed from their 



Prhwipal British Insects : ¦— Terminology, 



423 





grub or caterpillar state, and a few undergo no material change 
whatever, after they are hatched from their ^g^ or embryo. 

Insects, in their imago or perfect state, are composed of 
four principal parts: viz. caput, the head; truncus, the trunk ; 
abdomen, the hinder part ; and artus, the members. 

Caputs the head {fig, 1 80. a\ is furnished with 6culi> eyes (Z>), 
<f 180 ^ ,« ^, in number 

from two to 
eight ; anten- 
nae, horns (c); 
OS, the mouth 
(c?), composed 
of labrum su- 
•^-P perius, the up- 
^ per lip, and 
labrum infe- 
rius, the lower 

lip ; mandibulae, mandibles or lateral jaws ie) ; maxillae, 
lateral appendices of the mouth {f) ; galeae, shields of the 
mouth ; ligula, a latchet, acting as a lower lip, situated under 
the jaws ; lingua, the tongue ; rostrum, a movable beak ; pro- 
boscis, the feeding trunk ; haustellum, the mouth of some 
insects, so called from its property of drawing up and folding 
under ; palpi, feelers ; frons, the face ; clypeus, the shield of 
the head; vertex, the crown of the head; and gula, the 
throat {£), 

Truncus^ the trunk, consists of the thorax, the part between 
the head and the base of the wings (^); pectus, the breast (?), 
to which the legs are attached, as also, 
in some cases, the wings and elytra ; 
sternum, the breast-bone {¥) ; and 
scutellum, a little shield, situate at 
the posterior part of the thorax (/). 
To the trunk are also attached alae, 
the wings ; elytra, the wing-covers (m) ; and halteres, the ba- 
lancers, exemphfied in the common house-fly, and in Tipula. 
{fig\^\,aa). 

Abdomen^ the belly or third principal division, contains the 
intestines, ovary {fig, 180. n\ &c. ; and consists of the tergum, 
or upper part ; venter, the belly ; cauda, the tail ; and aciileus, 
the sting. 

Artus, the members, are pedes, the legs : composed of 
coxa, the first joint (o) ; femur, the thigh {p) ; tibia, the 
shank {q) ; tarsus, the foot (r) ; and unguis, the claw {s). 

All these parts differ in form, colour, and consistence, as will 
appear in describing insects of the different orders. These

orders, according to the system of Linnaeus, we shall shortly 
enumerate. They are confessedly very imperfect, compared 
with the orders of the most improved modern systems ; but 
they are nevertheless in such general use, and of such frequent 
occurrence in works of natural history, that a knowledge of 
them may be considered essential to every beginner. The 
more recent systems of insects, as of every other department 
of zoology, will, no doubt, at a proper time, find a place in 
the pages of your Magazine. The Linnean orders of the 
class Insects are seven ; viz. Coleoptera {koleos, a sheath, pferon, 
a wing; wings in sheaths), represented by the common black 
beetle, dor, or clock-beetle, ^Scarabae^us stercorarius {Jig, 180.) ; 
2. Hemiptera {kemisu, half, pte?'on, a wing; half of one wing 
overlaid by the other), which may be represented by the com- 
mon cockroach, i51atta orientalis (seen in^. 1. p. 19.) ; 3. Le- 
pidoptera {lepis, a scale, ptero?i, a wing ; wings covered with 
very fine scales), represented by the common butterfly; 4. 
Neuroptera {neuron, a nerve, pte7Wi, awing; wings reticulated), 
represented by the dragon-fly; 5. Hymenoptera (hi/men, a 
^\m, pteron, a wing; wings membranaceous), represented by 
the bee; 6. Diptera {dis, twice, ptero?i, a wing; two-winged), 
represented by the common gnat ; and 7. A'ptera {a, privative, 
pteron, a wing ; no wings), represented by the spider and the 
centipede. In my next communication, I shall give the natural 
history of one of the most interesting of the coleopterous in- 
sects. I remain, Sir, &c.

Art. V. Remarhs on British Land and Fresh-tvater Shells. 
By Mr. Joseph Kenyon. 

Sir, 
From the study of conchology in general, I have of late 
directed my attention more particularly to that branch which- 
embraces our native land and fresh-water shells. On attempt- 
ing, however, to make a systematic list, and refer each species 
to the works of the different authors to which I have access, I 
find the synonymes of several involved in much perplexity 
and doubt ; and as some of your readers may probably be 
engaged in similar pursuits, and may have access to extensive 
libraries and cabinets, I beg to trouble you with a few remarks 
and queries, resulting from my late observations, in the hope 
of receiving benefit from the labours of those who are more 
experienced. The names of the species I may have occasion

to mention will be those of Lamarck, when not otherwise dis- 
tinguished. 

Nerithia viy-ginea [fig, 182. a). — Is not this a fresh-water 
shell ? Yet Dr. Turton describes it as found on the western 
coasts of Ireland. Will not Dr. Turton's shells, from their 
locality and diminutive size, prove another species ? 

-5^ d Ca. /i 



182 



Valvdta piscindlis {h). — Along with this species, of the 
usual magnitude, I have found dead shells, four lines in 
length {c\ and several smaller ones of various sizes (tZ), agreeing 
pretty well with the species V. planorbis, V. ossirorbis, and 
V. minuta of Draparnaud, and which I have little doubt are all 
the young of the V. piscinalis in different stages of growth, 
although Lamarck refers to them as distinct. Mr. Dillwyn is 
evidently wrong in considering this species to be the Turbo 
thermalis of Linnaeus. The latter author describes his shell 
to be only a " little larger than a cabbage seed." The vague 
descriptions of authors often tend to confuse. Dr. Fleming, 
in the History of British Animals, jost published, in his spe- 
cific definition of this shell, characterises it as possessing " a 
large central cavity" but in his general description, a few lines 
lower, he says, " central cavity distinct, but 7iot large'' 

Lymnceafragilis, Fleming (^). — This must be the BuUmus 
fragilis of Lamarck, who, it evidently appears, has arranged 
this shell among his Bulimi, in consequence of not knowing 
the habitat. He states his specimen to have been received 
from Dr. Leach. 

Lymncea detrita, Fleming (/*). — Does Lamarck include 
more than one species under his Biilimus radiatus; and, if so, 
is not this one ? 

Lymnce'a avdta {g), — What I consider to be this shell occurs 
in tolerable abundance in this neighbourhood. My speci- 
mens, several of them an inch in length, agree with the 
figures given by Draparnaud, but Lamarck describes his shell 
to be only 6h lines long. Is this the large variety of ^eli^ 
putris mentioned in Dr. Turton's Conchological Dictionary ? 
What is the Helix putris of Linnaeus ? Is it this shell, the 
Lymnae^a peregra, or the Succinea amphibia ? 

VooL. I. -r-No. 5. G G 



42©^ Bemarlcs on British Land and FresJi-water Shells, 

PlanMis nitidus (Jig. 182. h). — Does not Lamarck include 
two species under this name, viz. the iVautilus lacustris (/), and 
if elix fontana of EngUsh authors ? The description and refer- 
ence to Draparnaud evidently belong to the latter shell ; the 
references to Muller and Gmelin probably to the former, but 
not possessing the works of either of the two last-mentioned 
authors, I cannot determine. 

Smcinea amphibia {fig. 183. k). — Is this the Helix putris, or 
H. limosa of Linnaeus ? Cuvier, Lamarck, and Fleming say the 
former. But it is worthy of observation, that Linnaeus, in his 
Systema NatiircJCy refers to Gualter t. 5. f. h. for a figure of the 
latter shell, which figure is undoubtedly the Succinea am- 
phibia. The habitat given by him for the II. limosa also accords 
better than that of the H. putris, with the shell in question. 
Did Linnaeus possess a cabinet of the shells described by him 
in the Syst. Nat.; and, if so, did it, with his herbarium, get 
into the hands of the late lamented President of the Linnaean 
Society? Many difficulties might be cleared up on a reference 
to the shells, if in existence. 




183 




Clansilia ventricosa, Drap. [l). — I consider tlvjs to be the shell 
described by English authors under the name of Turbo bipli- 
catus. Dr. Fleming is of opinion, however, that Draparnaud 
has not described our shell. The two specimens in my pos- 
sesions, and which I received from that excellent naturalist, 
¦Mr. R. Leyland of Halifax, accord well with Draparnaud's 
figure, and very nearly so with his description. 

Clausilia solida, Drap. (m). — Is this the Turbo labiatus of 
English authors; and, if not, has the latter shell been de- 
scribed by any of the Continental writers, and under what 
name ? I have not seen the shell. 

Pupa britdiinica {n). — I have ventured to give this name to 
the Turbo tridens of English authors, as the shell appears to 
be unknown among the Continental conchologists. It is not 
the Pupa tridens of Lamarck, and many of Dillwyn*s syno- 
nymes are erroneous. Dr. Fleming places this species in the 
new genus Azeca, but appears dissatisfied with its station, and 
suspects it may eventually associate with his genus Cary- 
chium ; in this, however, he is incorrect, since the animal, in 
the latter genus, possesses only two teutacula, whilst the 




Remarks oti British Land and Fresh-'water Shells, 427 

Pupa britannica, as I have lately ascertained from living 
specimens, is furnished with four. The shell in question in . 
the Lamarckian arrangement agrees best with the genus Pupa, 
and the specific appellation is untenable, and another neces- 
sary, not only to distinguish it from the P. tridens of La- 
marck, but to correct an error with regard to the number of 
its teeth, which, in reality, are five. The appellation P. 
quinquedentata might have served, if some other species of 
this genus were not also furnished with five teeth. As there 
is already a Pupa germanica, the specific name I have 
adopted appears to be as little exceptionable as any other, 
particularly if the shell be not really found out of this 
country. Should the Baron de Ferussac have noticed this 
shell by any other name, of course it will have the prefer- 
ence, as I am inimical to useless changes in nomenclature. 
There is no necessity for the adoption of the new-fangled 
genus Azeca. If Dr. Fleming considered he would be doing 
nature too much violence by placing this shell amongst his 
Pupse, he might have found an unobjectionable receptacle in 
the genus Chondrus, established by Baron Cuvier. 

Piipa muscor-um. — This is much confused. There are 
three shells described by conchologists under this name and. 
that of Turbo Twuscorum {Jig. 183. o p q), all referring to 
Linnaeus ; and Donovan has figured a fourth species, as his 
Turbo Twuscorum {Jig. 183. r). 

Helix Jiisca, Turton, &c. (y%. 184<. 5). — Dr. Fleming sus- 
pects this to be the H. fulva of Muller. The English shell is 
about half an inch in diameter, whilst the figure of that of 
Muller, given by Draparnaud, if I recollect rightly, is little 
more than a line.

Helix celldria (tc), nkida[x), — Are these really distinct, or 
only the same shell in different stages of growth ? 
' lielix rufescens {y\ Eng. auth. — This common shell seems 
to be extremely ill understood. Is it referable to none of the 
numerous species described and figured by Draparnaud ? Cir- 
cumstances which have tended to render it more confused, are, 
that English authors have followed each other in describing 
the immature shell to be hairy, and that the figure given by 
Donovan, plate 151. f. 1., under the name of f/elix hispida, 
is the H, rufescens in a young state (z). The two shells are 
doubtless specifically distinct; the H, rufescens is keeled on 
the margin of the outer whorls and smooth, the other rounded 
and hispid. It has been imagined that these hispid shells lose' 
their hairiness, and add a keeled whorl to their former rounded 
ones, on arriving at maturity. This is fallacious. By care- 
fully removing the whorls of the H, rufescens with a knife, it 
will easily be perceived that they ar^ all keeled. I possess 
specimens from one to seven lines in diameter. The small 
ones are as distinctly keeled as the large. Observations of a 
similar nature have also been made by my friend, Mr. William 
Helm, a most successful and industrious collector here. 

Helix hispida {aa). — This species I take to be the hairy one, 
confounded with the Helix rufescens. Does the H. /urturum 
of Gmelin belong to this or the last ? 

Helix sericea, Drap.(^6). — I consider this the shell called 
iiTelix hispida by Turton, and several other English writers. 

A^nodon intermedius, ^g^ 

(fg. 185.) — Is this 
an English species ? 
The ikfytilus stagna- 
lis, dentatus and avo- 
nensis of Turton, &c., 
are ill understood ; and 
some of them may, if 
really distinct from the 
A. cycneus and anati- 
nus, be referable to this 
species. 

ITie number of indigenous land and fresh-water species, 
appears to be between 100 and 120, of which I and one or two 
other friends have collected about 60 species in this neigh- 
bourhood. Several described as rare, occur in tolerable abun- 
dance, whilst others which are represented as plentiful, have 
hitherto eluded our researches. I fear that a list of those dis- 
covered would be too unimportant to trouble you with, but 
should you be of a contrary opinion, it will be at your service.

Art. VI. An Introductory View of the Linnean System of 
Plants. By Miss Kent, Authoress of Flbra Dom^sticaf Sylvan 
Sketches, &c. 

(Continued from p. 238.) 

With our last letter we concluded the third class, Trian- 
dria; before we proceed to the next, it will be well to give 
some preliminary explanation of the different modes of inflo- 
rescence. Plants bear their blossoms in as many different 
fashions as a lady wears her jewels ; which fashions are called 
the modes of inflorescence. Some flowers grow on the stem, 
some on the leaves ; some opposite the leaves, some in their 
axils ; some laterally, some terminally ; some singly, some in 
pairs, and others in clusters ; and of these clusters there are 

various forms. The flowers of 
the dead-nettle grow in rings 
round the stem Ifig. 186.): 
these rings are termed isohirls^ 
or whorls ; and the flowers are 
either sessile (sitting close upon 
the stem) or have very short 
stalks. There is a plant now 
very common in gardens, 
called the Buddies globosa, 
which affords a good specimen 
of the cluster called a head {Jig.lSI.): the i87 

flowers are collected into a round ball, by 
growing very near together upon one common 
stalk ; they are mostly sessile, but have some- 
times each a short stalk, by which it is attached 
to the common one. Lavender flowers grow 
in spikes {fig. 188. a): the spike has a number 
of flowers, either sessile or on very short stalks, 
laterally attached to the main flower stalk. A 
bunch of currants exhibits the raceme : it differs

from the spike, in having the flowers 
visibly stalked, and all or nearly 
all in blow together ; whereas those 
of the spike begin to blow at the 
base, and the lower ones are usually 
withered before the upper ones are 
blown. The raceme, too, is mostly 
pendulous [f.g. 188. 6); the spike 
erect (g). A spike is sometimes com- 
pound; being formed of many little 
spikes, or spikelets, arranged upon 
another stalk, as the flowers are ar- 
ranged on the first. The panicle is a 

compound spike, only that the flowers have 
long stalks, which give the whole cluster a 
more loose and diffuse form ; as in London 
Pride, (/g-. 189.) An umhel has many stalks 
(called rays) collected together at the top of 
the stem, and spreading upwards in a hollow 
form, like the spokes of an umbrella re- 
versed : each ray terminates in a flower, if it 
is a simple umbel ; but, if the umbel is com- 
pound, it is crowned by a number of smaller 
rays, arranged in the same manner, which 
bear the flowers. The smaller are termed 
partial umbels ( Jig. 190. a)\ the main um- 
bel is termed the universal, or 
general, umbel {Jig, 190. b), A 
q/me, like the umbel, has 
many stalks meeting at the 
top of the stem ; but these 
are irregularly subdivided be- 
fore they terminate in the 
flowers ; as in the elder tree.

sort of cluster is also called a catkin^ from its resemblance 
to a cat's tail. Some persons reckon another cluster, called 
the thyrse ; but this is merely a fuller kind of panicle, which 
assumes an ovate (egg-shaped) form. 

We will now commence with the fourth class of plants, 
Tetrandria, distinguished by the four stamens in its blossoms. 
Some genera of this class might, at first sight, be confounded 
with those of the fifteenth ; but the number of stamens would 
soon clear up any mistake of this kind ; and when we treat 
of that class, we shall mention other distinctive characters. 
This class has three orders ; Monogynia, Digynia, and 
Tetragynia. Of the first order, we have fifteen British ge- 
nera; among which are the teasel, scabious, madder, bed- 
straw, plantain, cornel, &c. Of the teasel, one species is used 
by clothiers to raise the nap of woollen cloth ; whence it bears 
the name of Fuller's Teasel. It is a singular-looking plant, 
with a thick stem, 5 or 6 ft. high, clothed with several pairs 
of leaves at regular intervals : they are so combined (not 
only at the extreme base, but at their sides also, for an inch 
or more) as to form a sort of basin round the stem. Such 
leaves are botanically termed connate {con, together, riatus, 
born, or grown). The reservoirs formed by their union col- 
lect the rain ; sometimes containing half a pint or more ; 
which sustains the plant during long drought. In desert coun- 
tries, the weary and fevered traveller would sometimes ex- 
change the whole of his property for the luxury of a draught 
from one of these water-lodging plants ; but in this country 
the moisture is of more use to the plant itself than to the 
passenger or the possessor. The flowers are collected into 
conical heads, aboiit the size of a hen's egg, upon a receptacle 
set with a number of chaffy scales hooked at their edges. 
{fig. 193.) When the flowers wither, 
these heads are set in frames, and 
drawn over woollen cloth to raise the 
nap; for which purpose the scales 
have just sufficient strength, yielding 
before they reach the cloth itself. 
This operation is called teasing, from 
which, most probably, the plant ob- 
tained its name. The botanical ap- 
pellation, Z)ipsacus, is derived from 
the Greek, dipsa, thirst; though the 
plant is rather a reliever, than a re-

The scabious also bears its flowers in heads, although in 
some of the species they are rather hemispherical than glo-

bular; they are so formed in the Sweet Scabious, that fragrant 
deep purple flower, which the Italians call Vedovina, Little 
Widow. We have three British species. The Field Scabious 
is of a very pale purple colour, which, being held a few 
minutes over the smoke of tobacco, gives place to a beautiful 
green. The species called the Devil's-bit Scabious has a 
blackish root, which appears as though the end had been 
bitten off; and this, it seems, is true. The devil, we are told, 
grudged mankind the benefits they were likely to receive from 
it, and bit off the greater part; it is from this malicious 
action that the English name is derived. Sir J. E. Smith ob- 
serves that he has been completely successful, not only having 
shortened the root, but having left the remainder totally useless. 
Madder is used in dying red. Our British madder yields a 
dye inferior to the species commonly cultivated for that pur- 
pose, but it is frequently substituted for it, as is the yellow bed- 
straw also ; and Curtis says it yields a finer red. This latter 
plant affords a good yellow dye, likewise ; the flowers serve to 
coagulate milk, and were formerly used in the making of Che- 
shire cheese. 

The plantains, which are generally overlooked as plants 
unworthy of note, are very pretty and delicate. Most of the 
species spread their leaves on the earth, in the form of a star ; 
they are elegantly shaped, and marked with many parallel ribs. 
The flowers, though small, are numerous, and grow in close 
spikes ; the silvery corollas, some full blown, others just peep- 
ing from their green calyx, their long pink filaments, and the 
large white anthers, so slightly adhering to them as to be in 
a continually tremulous motion, are well worthy of attention. 
The seeds afford a grateful supply of food to many small birds ; 
as also does the cornel tree. This tree, frequently called dog- 
wood, and mentioned by Chaucer under its old name of 
gaitre tree, was formerly in high repute for the making of 
spears. An oil for the lamp may be obtained from the ber- 
ries ; which are black and bitter. The fruit of the dwarf cor- 
nel is red, sweet, and palatable ; and was formerly preserved 
in the form of rob, or made into wine. 

Among the foreigners of this order are many handsome 
genera, chiefly from the Cape and New Holland. The Bad- 
dlea globosa (named from Adam Buddie, and from the glo- 
bular clusters of its flowers) before mentioned is a native of 
Chile ; the clusters look like little balls of honeycomb, and 
have both the colour and scent of honey. Sandal wood {Sdn- 
tahim album) is an East Indian shrub of this order. One 
peculiarly magnificent genus is the Prote^r : one species of this 
is called the Silver Tree (Prote« argentea), the leaves have the 



Linnean System of Plants. 4 35 

softness of satin, with the brightness and whiteness of silver ; 
others of this species are called Golden Proteas; one, more 
especially, has a leaf of golden green edged with scarlet, and 
appears, at some distance, like a flaming fire. 

We have but one genus of the second order, and that is a 
doubtful native, containing only one species, Buff'onz^ tenui- 
folia (Slender-leaved BufFonia). Sauvages gave this plant its ge- 
neric name in honour of Buffon ; and it is believed that when 
Linnaeus added the specific appellation, he alluded not only 
to the slender leaves of the plant, but also to the slender claims 
of the French naturalist to any botanical honours. Linnaeus 
was fond of these allusions, and hence the conjecture may 
have arisen, perhaps without foundation. 

Of the third order, Tetragynia, we have seven genera ; of 
which number is the holly (/^lex^quifolium), a beautiful ever- 
green, which we may look upon with pleasure, as asso- 
ciated with the festivities of Christmas ; but which the poor 
birds have little cause to delight in, since it furnishes the lime 
by means of which they are made captive. An old holly tree 
which has become smooth with age (for age deprives the leaves 
of their spines) is a noble object, more especially when 
adorned with its bright scarlet berries. There are many 
foreign species of this genus. The leaves of the South Sea tea 
tree (/^lex vomitoria) are made, by the natives of the South 
Sea Islands, into a medicinal tea, which, at certain seasons <2)f 
the year, they drink to excess. 

We are now to consider the fifth class, Pentandria, which 
includes nearly a sixth part of the vegetable world ; the first 
two orders, in particular, are very extensive, comprehending 
nearly the whole class, though it is divided into seven. 

Of the first order, Monogynia, the British Flora compre- 
hends forty-one genera ; it is subdivided into several sections ; 
the first of which consists of a natural family of plants, called 
Asperifoliae (harsh-leaved), and contains ten genera. 
Their flowers are monopetaloiis (one-petaled), iTife- 
rior, and have two or four seeds, which lie naked at 
the bottom of the calyx. By inferior, we do not 
mean in quality, as some young learners suppose, 
but in situation. When the corolla or calyx en- 
velopes the fruit, the flower is termed iriferior, 
being below the fruit; if the corolla or calyx sits 
upon the top of the fruit [Jig, 194.), it is called 
superior, being above the fruit. 

The flowers of this section are chiefly blue, varying to red, 
sometimes in the selfsame blossom, and mostly pink in the 
bud. They grow in clusters, which, when in bud, curl round 




434 Introductory Viem of the 

like the tail of a viper, and gradually lengthen and straighten 
as the flowers blow. The calyx is of one leaf, usually five- 
cleft ; the corolla of one petal, tubular in the lower part, the 
upper cut into five segments. The stamens are concealed 
within the tube, the mouth of which is frequently closed by 
five little valves, which meet in the centre. In these charac- 
ters, all the ten genera agree ; as they do, also, in having flowers 
as delicate, as the herbage is coarse. One interesting plant, 
the Forget-me-not (Myosotis palustris), has the bristles of its 
leaves so fine, as scarcely to render them rough either to the 
eye or to the touch. This plant grows about a foot high, with 
oval leaves, of a bright green, somewhat shining and sessile ; 
the flower is about a third of an inch in 
diameter, of a delicate blue, with a yel- 
low eye, formed by the valves beifbre 
mentioned ; it grows in marshes, and by 
the sides of brooks and rivers. Other 
species are frequently mistaken for this, 
but they have smaller flowers, and the 
eye is not so bright as in the true For- %J?^<:;»' ^^^ 

get-me-not ; which we speak of thus at 
length, because it has been repeatedly 
celebrated by poets of different countries, 
is respected in Germany as the emblem 
of affection, and is deserving of notice 
from its own beauty, {fig* 195.) 

The second section of this order contains sixteen genera, 
which, like those of the first, have their flowers monopetalous 
and inferior^ but have numerous seeds, enclosed in a covering 
called a capsule (casket). Of this section are many of our fa- 
vourite flowers: the convolvulus, which twines around its neigh- 
bours, and frequently conceals them with its numerous stems 
and heart-shaped leaves ; the primrose, which we all hail as 
the pretty pale herald of the spring ; the periwinkle, which 
crowds its fine evergreen leaves into clumps and tufts, flou- 
rishing in shades too confined for most plants to thrive in ; the 
water violet, a tall showy plant, which conceals its leaves under 
the water, and erects its large flowering head two or three feet 
above it; the mullein, with its tall golden pyramids rising from 
a bush of leaves, so thick, soft, and downy, as to serve the 
Russian peasantry for socks in their rigorous winters; the 
shepherd's weatherglass (so named from the warning it gives 
of coming rain, by the closing of its corolla), which, with the 
exception of the poppy, is tlie only scarlet flower indigenous 
of Britain ; and the nightshade or bittersweet (5olanum Dul- 
camara), which wears a necklace of pearls, and produces one 




Linnean System of Plants, 435 

of the most elegant berries that the vegetable world can boast ; 
shaped like an egg^ and sparkling like a ruby. To this last 
genus belongs our domestic friend, the potato ; said to have 
been first brought to Ireland by Sir Walter Raleigh, and 
thence introduced into England. Most species of the Solanum 
are poisonous, and the potato is so, in some degree, before it 
is exposed to the action of fire. The plant known by the 
name of the Deadly Nightshade ( A'trop« Belladonna) is of ano- 
ther genus, contains a most virulent and powerful poison, and 
should never be suffered to grow in the public way. It has, 
indeed, on this account been so frequently eradicated, that it is 
now a very rare plant. It bears a large handsome purple 
flower, and is honoured with the appellation of jP^/r Z/«c^. 
The generic name is derived from Atropos, one of the Fates. 
" How the same plant should come to have the gentle appella- 
tion of Belladonna^ and the tremendous name of Atropa, seems 
strange, till we know that it was used as a wash, among the 
Italian ladies, to take off pimples and other excrescences from 
the skin, and are told of its dreadful effects as a poison," ob- 
serves Rousseau. 

The third section contains six genera, with flowers motiope- 
talous and superim- : of this number are " the gadding wood- 
bine," with its honey-bearing trumpets ; and the campanula, 
of which genus is the delicate little heath-bell, that nods on 
the summit of a stalk so slender as to appear supported by 
magical influence. Many persons call this the hare-hell^ but 
the true English hare-hell is the English hyacinth (iScilla 
nutans). These two plants have been frequently confounded by 
poets ; but, according to Sir J. E. Smith, the little campanula, 
which we call the heath-hell^ is the hare-hell of Scotland, while 
the hare-hell of England is the Scottish hlue-helL 

The fourth section has four genera; with flowers inferior^ 
and four or five petaled. To this section belongs that beau- 
tiful genus, the violet. i!/edera, the ivy, and Rihes, the cur- 
rant bush, are the only two genera composing the fifth section ; 
their flowers are five-petaled {pentapetalom) and superior. 
The sixth section has flowers without petals {apetalous) ; it con- 
tains three genera. 

This class and order, though it contains a great number of 
splendid and truly beautiful plants, and is remarkably exten- 
sive, is by no means the most important to mankind. Beauty, 
however, is not its only claim to consideration, as will readily 
be acknowledged ; for it has a fee to purchase praise from 
every class of society : it is in possession of the tobacco plant 
of Virginia, of the coffee tree of Arabia, and of vines from

various parts of the world : these will insure it respect, even 
from those who deny it to the elegance, the splendour, and the 
fragrance of its fine flowers.

Art. VII. Contributions to'wards a Flhra Hibernica. Being a 
List of Plants not before observed "wild in Ireland: together tvitk 
New Localities for a few of the more Rare Ones. By Edward 
Murphy, Esq. A.B. Trin.'CoU., Dublin. 

The plants in the subjoined list were principally observed 
in a botanical and geological tour, which I made for the 
North-west of Ireland Society, in the summer of 1826. Cir- 
cumstances have retarded, hitherto, the publication of the 
Catalogue drawn up for the Society, but their object in insti- 
tuting researches of this nature being to make known the 
natural history of the district with which they are more 
immediately concerned, it will readily be conceded that the 
means best calculated to attain that end is to record, from time 
to time, any discoveries which may be made. 

My investigations were confined to the counties of Tyrone, 
Donegal, and Derry; and, having been undertaken in May, after 
the early phaenogamous and most of the cryptogamous plants 
had disappeared, they were not by any means so successful as, 
under more favourable circumstances, it is reasonable to sup- 
pose they would have been. But, indeed, the north of Ireland, 
and particularly the portion of it above mentioned, is far from 
fertile in botanical treasures. The surface of Tyrone aqd 
Derry, with the exception of a few basaltic fa9ades in the 
north of the latter, consists of a succession of low rounded 
hills, invariably covered to their summits with bog, and pro- 
ducing only a fatiguing repetition of the ^ricae, Eriophora, 
Scirpi, and Carices, common to such situations. Donegal, 
though possessing great variety of soil and surface, and the 
mountains of which, in elevation and the other requisites, are 
to appearance peculiarly adapted to the growth of alpine 
plants, is notwithstanding extremely unproductive. I have no 
hesitation in saying, that a greater number of rare j)la?its may 
be found in one glen in Carnarvonshire than is afforded 
by this entire district. That other parts of this country 
however, are not uninteresting, in a botanical point of 
view, is abundantly evident in the great variety of plants 
observed by Mr. Drummond in the county of Cork, as well as 



Contributions to*txards a Flora Hibernica, 437 

in 'two or three autumnal excursions by the late Dr. Wade 
and Mr. M'Kay, a catalogue of all of which was published by 
the last-mentioned gentleman in 1825. In climates favour- 
able to vegetation, the variety of plants is generally propor- 
tional to that of the soil and surface, and when it is known 
that scarcely a rock of any extent has hitherto been dis- 
covered, the prototype of which does not exist in this country, 
as it already is that its mountains exceed for the most part in 
elevation those of England, and are little inferior to those of 
Scotland, we may confidently premise that its botany vs^ill, 
when adequately investigated, be found equally respectable 
with that of the sister countries.

Art. VIII. On the Natural Order ^Plants, Dicotyledhnecei 
Anonaceae. By Mrs. E. Bowdich. 

It is one of the peculiar beauties of the natural system, to 
be so frequently able to recognise the general qualities of a 
plant, by merely referring to the name of the order to which 
it belongs. The physiological portion of botany places it 
among the most important of those studies furnished by nature ; 
and the mere repetition of long names, the counting of petals 
and stamina, &c., are, by uniting them to the uses of plants, 
raised into a science which benefits mankind. 

The family of Anondcece, composed of trees and shrubs, is 
one of the most natural of the different orders, and presents, 
not only a strong similarity of appearance, but a remarkable 
analogy in the qualities of its species. Its existence is mostly 
confined to that portion of the globe contained between the 
tropics; it is eminently beautiful, and not less useful to the 
natives of the countries to which it is indigenous. Almost all 
the individuals classed in it possess a strong aromatic or pun- 
gent odour, which is shared by the roots, the bark, and even 
the leaves. 

The period of its discovery is not exactly known ; but the 
Anbna squamosa is mentioned by Oviedo in his work on 
America, published in the year 15^6* In 1548, we hear of 
the Ethiopian, or Malaguetta pepper; and, in 1648, three or 
four of the Brazilian species were described. Rheede men- 
tioned the Malabar species in 1 703 ; since that, one has been 
discovered in New Holland ; and, still more recently, Palisot 
de Beauvois speaks of several belonging to Africa. There 
are, probably, many more hidden in the immense forests of 
that continent, of which we have so imperfect a notion. 

The flowers of the Anondcea vary in form, but the petals 
are generally thick and coriaceous; they are mostly red. 



Dicotyledbnecc^ Anonaceas. 



439 



white, and yellow, and none have yet been discovered of a 
blue colour. The genus Kadsura is the only example of 
dentated leaves; and these leaves, when steeped in water, 
yield an abundant mucilage, used by the Japanese in the fa- 
brication of the paper made from the Broussonet/a papyrifera. 
The women of Japan also rub it on their hair before their 
heads are shaved. 

The genus And?ia, mentioned by Oviedo under the name 
of Gzianabdnus, but established as the Anona by Linnaeus, 
bears fruits, each of which consists of a many-seeded berry, so 
formed by the junction of several one-seeded berries. They 
are generally good to eat ; but are said to be unpalatable to 
Europeans at first. We have heard, however, of their being 
sought with avidity after one trial. The J, muricata, coming 
froni South America, and the western coast of Africa, yields 
what the English call the sour-sop, which is a large oblong 
fruit, filled with a white, watery, and acid pulp, enveloping 
many large, shining, black seeds. It is veiy cooling and re- 
fi'eshing, and reckoned wholesome. The A. squamosa, from 
both India and Africa, bears a beautiful green berry, the size 
of a small pine-apple, and resembling it in form. There is so 
much saccharine matter in it, that the sugar, oozing through 
the rind, crystallises on the outside, and gives it a very pretty 
appearance. It is extremely luscious in taste. The A. reti- 
culata gives us the custard-apple, which is about the size of 
one of our largest apples, and is filled with a yellow cream- 
like pulp, and in flavour is very similar to a newly made 
custard. It is indigenous to the Caribbee Islands, and grows 
in Africa and Malabar ; it has also succeeded in the Island of 
Madeka. The fruits of the A. paiudosa (j%. 196, a), A, palus- 



196 




tris. A, longifolia (^), and A. glabra, are also much esteemed 
for their edible properties. Those of the A. Cherimblia (b) 
are reckoned among the best fruits of Peru, and have an agree- 



440 Natural Order of Plant s^ Anoniiceae. 

able vinous flavour. The roots of the A. asiatica are employed 
in Ceylon for making a red dye, and those of the Araticu pon- 
ha are so large, and at the same time so light, that the Indians 
of South America make shields from them. The leaves of the 
A.Amhotdy{f), and the ^. muricata, are applied, with effect, 
to wounds, to promote suppuration. The wood of the A. 
palustris is so soft and pliant, that it is used instead of cork. 

From the fruits of the Asimina triloba, or Anbiia triloba 
according to Linnaeus, a spirituous liquor has been extracted ; 
and Duhamel says that, although the pulp may be eaten, the 
rind is so acrid, that, if the eyes are touched with the fingers 
after handling it, they become inflamed. This, however, wants 
confirmation. 

The wood of the genus Porcelia is used in Peru for beams 
and rafters ; the fruits are edible, and a yellow dye may be 
extracted from the leaves. 

The fruits of the genus Uvaria are not yet fully known ; 
but those of the U. zeylanica are supposed to resemble an 
apricot in flavour. 

Among the species of the genus Unbna we find the (7. 
aethiopica, so well known on the western coast of Africa un- 
der the name of Malaguetta pepper. It is a sovereign remedy, 
among the natives of that country, for rheumatism, weakness 
of limbs, headaches, or, in fact, any local pain. It is bruised 
in water, so as to form a paste, which is rubbed on the pait 
affected ; a bandage is added, and the patient is immediately 
covered with a quantity of clothing. In a short time a very 
agreeable tingling of the skin commences, which is succeeded 
by a general glow, and, subsequently, a violent perspiration. 
Europeans have spoken highly of it, as a remedy, from their 
own experience. The roots of the U. Ndrum are used for 
various complaints, both in Malabar and in the Moluccas; 
and a strong-smelling oil is extracted from the bark, which 
also enters into the list of medicines. The bark of the U. 
tripetaloidea affords a gum of delicious odour. The flowers of 
the L7. odorata {c) have a very aromatic smell, similar to that 
of European pinks. It is much cultivated on this account ; 
and the Japanese decorate their persons, and even their beds 
with it. The (7. undulata affords, in the bight of Benin, one 
of the best spices of Owaree. 

The genus Xylopia also yields agreeable spices, and the 
wood of the X. frutescens {d) is so flexible as to be employed 
for cordage. 

The leaves of the genus Guatt^rifl have, in general, a very 
acrid and aromatic taste ; they are applied in rheumatic cases, 
and an extract from them is given in Malabar at the com- 



Leaves of Malaxis jpaludbsa. 4'4] 

mericement of intermittent fevers. The flowers of the G. 
vh'gata [g) possess a delicious fragrance. 

Assembling, as we do, in this country, and easily procuring, 
every thing that is useful and ornamental, it may be a mere 
matter of amusement thus to sketch the uses of foreign plants : 
but could we, for a moment, imagine ourselves out of the 
I'each of European assistance and European luxuries, we 
should be glad of every resource presented to us by nature, 
and congratulate ourselves on possessing a knowledge of her 
treasures. In all primitive countries where vegetation is 
luxuriant, it supplies every department of life with a mine of 
wealth. Not only is it employed in the construction of edi- 
fices, weapons of offence and defence, household utensils, and 
musical instruments ; but it affords clothing, ornaments, food, 
medicines, and is, even, the great source from which rude 
people draw their poetry and romance. 

The physiological botanist, therefore, possesses great ad- 
vantages when travelling in these wild countries ; and it has 
been observed, that the respect felt by savages for this sort 
of knowledge increases their confidence in strangers, and gives 
them a favourable impression of the omniscience of civilised 
Europeans. 



Art. IX. On the Leaves of Malaxis paludosa. By the Reverend 
John Stevens Henslow, Professor of Botany in the University 
of Cambridge. 

Sir, 

In the fourth volume of the English Flora, Sir James Smith 
has described the leaves of Malaxis paludosa, as " roughish 
about the extremity, often somewhat fringed, so that this plant 
may perhaps have given rise to the report of a hairy-leaved 
Orchis," &c. 

This plant occurs in great plenty in the bogs on Gamlingay 
Heath, Cambridgeshire, where I had an opportunity of exa- 
mining it a few days ago, and ascertained the cause of the 
fringed appearance of the leaf, alluded to by Smith. Every 
specimen I gathered exhibited this in a greater or less degree, 
and it required only the assistance of a common lens to show 
me that it was occasioned by numerous little bulbous germs, 
sprouting fi'om the edge, and towards the apex of the leaf, as 
represented in th^ accompanying sketch ( fig, 197. a b). They 
were of the same colour as the leaves, green on those which 
were more exposed to the light, and quite white on those which 
were lowest on the stem, and half buried in peat and moss.

Some of these germs were so far advanced as to have put forth 
the rudiments of two or three leaves {cd)\ others less so [ef).

These plants often occur in little clusters of half a dozen or 
more close together, which may be accounted for by several 
of the germs arriving at perfection, whilst the rest perish. 
Otherwise, so far as 1 have observed, the plant is generally 
continued by a single offset, and three or four of the old de- 
cayed bulbs may be found, one below the other, among the 
peat, and still attached to the living stem. ^' 

This and Malaxis Loesel/? are probably truly parasitic.

In a former article (p. 249.), devoted to the consideration 
of two interesting geological memoirs, it was judged a fitting 
opportunity to contribute a series of preparatory illustrations 
of stratification, partly original, and the remainder selected 
from authentic data.* If we deviated somewhat from the 
strict course of an elementary treatise, and brought forward 
matter which should have formed a section at a more advanced 
stage, it will, perhaps, be conceded that those details were not 
unseasonably introduced. Our progress will henceforth be 
more regular. In the limited space which can here be appro-

priated to this department of natural history, condensation of 
facts and opinions is indispensable. All that can be under- 
taken is an oiithne of characteristic features. Those of our 
own country naturally demand our earliest and chief atten- 
tion ; and it appears expedient, for the present, to reserve for 
some future article the subject of continental geology, and its 
relations with this island. In briefly tracing the rapid progress 
of the science, we shall derive gratification from enumerating 
many successful investigators and distinguished authorities. 

The necessities of man, doubtless, led him, in the first in- 
stance, when in search of the useful productions of the mineral 
kingdom, to take cursory notice of the rocks in which those 
substances were embedded. As his wants and luxuries mul- 
tiplied, his knowledge of the earths, of the metals, coals, stones, 
and marbles, their uses and properties, increased, and his ob- 
servations necessarily became more minute. Such observations 
would be essential to save labour, and to acquire those valued 
productions at the smallest cost, and at the least sacrifice of 
time. To accomplish these objects, he found it necessary to 
study obscure indications ; and, however imperfect the evidence 
and scattered the data, to trace the subjects of his search, to 
mark their position, and to define the extent of their deposi- 
tories. Thus far advanced, he began to reason on the nature 
of those substances, on the phenomena observable in their 
matrices, on the origin of those singular organic forms incor- 
porated in the solid rocks, and on the infinite variety manifested 
in their structure, their situations, and attendant circumstances. 
Hence originated his first geological speculations, which were 
not unmixed with a portion of superstition. Surrounded by 
so many interesting objects, of which all his reasonings could 
not afford a satisfactory explanation, his imagination readily 
suggested a solution of those difficulties which his ignorance 
of natural science left unaccounted for. He observed every 
where, whether on the earth's surface, or in its profoundest 
depths, traces of a different state of things at some vastly re- 
mote period. With that sensation of awe, which the sublimity 
of such scenes would inspire, he viewed the uplifted peaks, 
and pinnacled summits of the primitive mountains, piercing 
through the clouds, covered with perpetual snows, and inac- 
cessible to human foot. In their neighbourhood he saw other 
rocks, of somewhat less rugged and imposing contour, whose 
masses every where bore marks of violent disturbances, and 
contained within them the substances best adapted for his 
domestic purposes. Beyond these rocks he observed a nume- 
rous group of others, of yet more softened outline, with sur- 
faces more favourable to cultivation ; and in whose structure 



444 Progress of Geology, 

were mingled myriads of organic bodies, whose forms in some 
cases were unknown to him, and in others nearly resembled 
those of the existing inhabitants of the ocean. Stretching 
further were vast plains and gently rounded eminences, com- 
posed of less indurated materials, and bearing internal evidence 
both of' their marine origin, and of the subsequent action of 
mighty waters upon their disturbed surfaces. Amidst the 
fragments that overspread these plains, he occasionally disco- 
vered bones of gigantic animals, which furnished matter for 
the wildest conjectures, and most extravagant speculations. 
All these phenomena led irresistibly to the conclusion, that 
the earth had undergone some stupendous revolution, which, 
as corroborated by Mosaic testimony, had " broken up the 
fountains of the great deep," and " destroyed every living sub- 
stance which was upon the face of the ground." 

But it was not then anticipated that these extraordinary 
appearances in the earth, the peculiarities of its structure, the 
alternation of its materials, and the multitude of intermediate 
gradations, indicated many separate geological epochs, many 
destructive revolutions, and many intervals of repose and re- 
production. Amidst the chaotic confusion of the lofty moun- 
tain ranges, amidst the perplexity, the dislocations, and distor- 
tions of those rocks which occupied less elevated and more 
habitable regions, no traces of original order were perceived. 
In the rocks which were crowded with organic remains, no 
distribution of species in particular beds or portions, no regu- 
larity of superposition, no undeviating arrangement, no suc- 
cession of strata, traversing whole countries, could yet be 
discerned. Their relative ages, the comparative eras which 
are determinable by positive evidence, such, for instance, as 
the deposition of a series of horizontal over inclined beds, were 
then unsuspected. 

The animal remains, it is true, were too singular to be 
overlooked. Absurd notions were promulgated of their origin, 
and although many of the most remarkable were collected for 
their rarity or their beauty, no idea was then entertained of 
their applicability in identifying the strata, and their superior 
adaptation as geological tests. 

Then arose those innumerable chimerical theories, flowing 
from an imperfect knowledge of facts, or founded on circum- 
stances not universal ; on phenomena and reasonings appli- 
cable to minute portions of the surface, rather than to the 
entire globe. 

As no science invites speculation more than geology, the 
press, during the last century, teemed with systems, which in 
turn were advocated and renounced by the philosophers of the 



Progress of Geology. 445 

day. To detail these would be an obvious waste of time. 
They were only so far useful, as they promoted discussion, and 
excited enthusiasm in controversy, and as their results were 
deeper examination and sounder views. 

Geology may, in truth, be classed with the modern sciences, 
since it is so recently as the year 1815 that the first geological 
map of this, or probably of any other country, was pro- 
duced In referring, thus early, to that great undertaking, 
it is scarcely necessary to premise, that it was designed to 
exhibit the boundaries of the various classes of rocks, strata, 
and deposits, in this kingdom ; to define the areas they respec- 
tively occupy; to determine, with greater precision, the posi- 
tion of such strata or substances as are subservient to the pur- 
poses'of man ; and, at the same time, by ascertaining the actual 
condition and arrangement of the several formations, to furnish 
more accurate data than were before possessed, whence to 
judge of the nature of those stupendous changes to which our 
planet has been subjected. 

Prior to a period which perhaps may be brought down to 
the middle of the eighteenth century, the fact of the extensive 
succession of rocks, and their continuity across our island, does 
not appear to have been suspected. The philosophers of pre- 
ceding times furnish, in their writings, few hints that they enter- 
tained any but the most vague notions of the distribution and 
relative position of those formations which occasionally at- 
tracted their attention. 

There wanted not individual collectors of such remarkable 
productions as accident brought to view ; nor was there any 
lack of theorists to devise ingenious systems, from these isolated 
data, by which to account, in their estimation, not only for the 
phenomena immediately before them, but for the formation, 
destruction, and subsequent renovation of the entire globe. It 
is foreign to the purpose of this article to refer more particu- 
larly to these speculations ; no benefit would accrue from the 
narrative, beyond the historical developement of a science 
which had the usual share of ignorance, prejudice, and obscur- 
ity to impede its infant progress.* 

* The following are the writers whose opinions have obtained the greatest 
celebrity, as advocates for particular systems accounting for the formation 
and subsequent alteration of the earth : — 

Mr. Whitehurst taught that the concentric arrangement of the crust of the 
globe was destroyed by the expansive force of subterranean fire. 

Burnet's theory supposes this crust to have been broken for the produc- 
tion of the deluge. 

Leibnitz and Buffon believed the earth to have been liquefied by fire ; 
in fact, that it is an extinguished sun or vitrified globe, whose surface has 
beeu operated upon by a deluge. The latter assumes that the earth was

446 Progress of Geology. 

There were men, even long prior to the time of which we 
speak, who appear to have had some glimpses of geological 
truth. One of these, George Owen, of Pembrokeshire, before 
the close of the sixteenth century, in describing the coal dis- 
trict of South Wales, shows that he was aware that the mine- 
ral masses were not confusedly assembled within its area, but 
extended in a certain uniform arrangement. The striking 
features presented by a coal field like that of South Wales, 
and the observation necessarily exercised in tracing the direc- 
tion of its principal mineral beds, for practical purposes, pro- 
bably led to an examination of the whole. It is in such 
situations, and under such circumstances, that the earliest 
geological investigations would originate. The facts, however, 
which resulted from this survey, were unavailing to the inter- 
ests of the science, as his manuscript remained unpublished 
until a few years ago. 

About the commencement of the eighteenth century, some 
geological descriptions of portions of Bedfordshire, Kent, and 
Somersetshire, appeared in the Philosophical Transactions. 
These are to be regarded rather as rough sketches of uncon- 
nected districts, than as parts of a systematic well defined 
arrangement. It was a point then undecided, " whether the 
stones we find in the form of shellfish be lapides sui generis, 
naturally produced by some extraordinary plastic virtue, latent 
in the earth, in quarries where they are found, or whether they 
rather owe their form and figure to the shells of the fishes 
they represent." {Dr, Plot, in 1677.) 

In favour of the former of these alternatives, appear the 
names of Plot, Ray, Lister, and other eminent naturalists, and 
it obtained advocates as late as the year 1752, the fossil re- 



75,000 years in cooling to its present temperature, and that, in 98,000 
years more, productive nature must be finally extinguished. 

Woodward considered there was a temporary dissolution of the ele- 
ments of the globe, during which period the extraneou8 fossils became in- 
corporated with the general mass. 

De LuCf Dolomieu, and, finally. Baron Cuvier, unite in the opinion, that 
the phenomena exhibited by the earth, particularly the alternate deposits of 
terrestrial and marine productions, can only be satisfactorily accounted for 
by a series of revolutions similar to the deluge. 

Among the singular views entertained by men of genius, in the infancy of 
the science, are those of Whiston^ " who fancied that the earth was created 
from the atmosphere of one comet, and deluged by the tail of another;" 
and that, for their sins, the antediluvian population were drowned ; " except 
the fishes, whose passions were less violent." 

A French geologist conceived that the sea covered the earth for a vast 
period; that all animals were originally inhabitants of the water; that their 
habits gradually changed on the retiring of the waves, and " that man him- 
self began his career as a fish ! " 



Progress of Geology, ^^*1 

mains being still strenuously asserted to be nothing more than 
links in the progressive series by which unorganised matter is 
connected with the animal world. 

Both the naturalists, Llwydd and Lister, seemed to hav« 
noticed that certain of these fossil shells were peculiar to, and 
afforded the means of distinguishing, certain rocks. They did 
not pursue their observations sufficiently far to apply this dis- 
covery extensively in classing the strata, but they are entitled 
to the merit of having recognised the principle. To the latter 
naturalist is also due the credit of suggesting, in 1684, the 
construction of maps, to denote, by colours, the superficial 
extent and boundaries of soils, clays, rocks, and mineral strata ; 
for, as he sagaciously observes, " we shall be better able to judge 
of the make of the earthy and of the many phenomena belong- 
ing thereto, when we shall have well and duly examined it, as 
far as human art can possibly reach, beginning from the out- 
side, downwards." 

Towards the middle of the eighteenth century, and extend- 
ing to the nineteenth, correct and enlarged views began to be 
entertained : on the Continent, as to the constancy in the posi- 
tion of fossil shells, in peculiar beds, and as to the distinctions 
between the primary and secondary rocks ; in England, as to 
the predominant characters of our most remarkable strata, 
their identity and continuity. In the list of foreign contribu- 
tors, during this period, occur the names of Guettard, Leh- 
man, Rouelle, BufFon, Werner, Saussure, and Pallas ; in 
the English, we record those of Mitchell, Whitehurst, Huttoii, 
and Playfair. 

We now approach an important epoch in the history of this 
science in England. The appearance of the first geological 
map, by Mr. William Smith, in the year 1815, after twenty- 
five years of unremitting application to the project, is an event 
of some moment. On the merit of this great performance, it 
is not practicable to enlarge here. Suffice it to quote the de- 
served encomium of a philosopher of another country, M. D'Au^ 
buisson. "That which the most distinguished mineralogists have 
done in a small part of Germany, in half a century, a single 
individual has undertaken and effected for the whole of Eng* 
land : and his work, as beautiful for its result as it is astonish- 
ing for its detail, has led to the conclusion, that England is 
regularly divided into beds ; that the order of their position 
is never inverted ; and that precisely similar fossils are found 
in all parts of the same bed, and at remote distances." 

A few years prior to this event, the number of enquirers 
into this interesting science had considerably augmented. 
Numerous individuals, highly qualified for the employment, 

H H 4 



^4f8 Progress of Geology, 

had entered with all the ardour inseparable from tliis pursuit, 
into various departments of research. Information was as 
freely diffused as circumstances would permit ; and that tena- 
cious adherence to favourite dogmas, which characterised an 
earlier period, gradually relaxed as men applied themselves to 
the preliminary acquisition of knowledge, to the rigorous exa- 
mination of facts on an extended scale, and the consequent 
developement of irresistible truths. 

The advantages, and indeed the necessity, of cooperation, 
in such an immense field of investigation, became more and 
more apparent. Hitherto the discoveries and opinions of in- 
dividuals were imperfectly known or understood ; their oppor- 
tunities of personal communication, of collision of sentiment, 
and of referring to authentic illustrations of British and foreign 
geology, were unfrequent. They were as yet not far removed 
from the time, " when the vague and cursory information that 
every man might glean from the objects that were perpetually 
before him, when combined and magnified by a powerful ima- 
gination, was sufficient for all the purposes of geological spe- 
culation. According to this view of the matter, a man might 
philosophise very well by himself; it was his business not to 
discover, but to invent ; and he stood no more in need of the 
assistance of others, than if he had been at work in the regions 
of poetry or romance." Under these disadvantages, it is not 
surprising that the progress of this branch of knowledge had 
been extremely slow. Such a state of things was obviously 
unfavourable for concentrating geological data and eliciting 
important results ; for ascertaining characteristic features, and 
describing them with precision, and for establishing an appro- 
priate nomenclature. To facilitate these desirable objects, it 
was necessary to combine the exertions of those who were 
engaged in a common pursuit, and its advocates soon became 
sensible of the impulse it had received from the union of labour. 
In the year 1807," most of the English geologists formed 
themselves into a society, which rapidly increased, and whose 
members have zealously and successfully employed themselves 
in researches into the geology, not of this country alone, but 
by degrees of almost every portion of the globe. It is scarcely 
necessary to add that which is understood and conceded by 
all geologists of our times, that they have less to do with spe* 
culations on the earth's formation, than with the acquisition 
of that evidence, by means of which it is alone probable a clue 
will be discovered' to those parts of the system that are as 
yet inexplicable ; acting upon the principle with reference to 
that ultimate object, that, " befoie attempting an explanation, it 
is best to he acquainted with the thing to he explained:* 



Progress of Geology. 449 

In looking at the mass of valuable information contained in 
the Transactions of the Geological Society^ at the many other 
illustrative works, of high estimation, which have appeared 
during the last ten or twenty years, and at the space which 
this science now occupies in our leading periodicals, we per- 
ceive proofs of the increasing number of observers, the im- 
mense variety of the objects under consideration, the skill 
which has been exercised in their developement, and the 
emulation excited to explore the vast series which yet remain. 
In the midst of apparent confusion there arises abundant evi- 
dence to show that order prevails, and that certain rules and 
principles have every where influenced the distribution of the 
phenomena we are attempting to investigate. This observ- 
ation is not new, neither is the result wholly unexpected. 

Eighteen years ago it was said, " if the face of the earth 
were divided into districts, and accurately described, we have 
no doubt that, from the comparison of these descriptions, the 
true theory of the earth would spontaneously emerge without 
any effort of genius or invention. It would appear as an in- 
controvertible principle, about which, all men, the moment 
that the facts were stated to them, must of necessity agree. 
Instead of a hundred different theories, about which they dis- 
pute with never ending sophistry, there would be a few general 
maxims, in which all men of sense and information would 
uniformly acquiesce." The period anticipated by the reviewer 
is still, probably, very remote. So vast an era presents an 
almost inexhaustible field to occupy the researches of geolo- 
gists yet to come. We possess at best but the rudiments of 
geological surveys of the principal portion of Europe. In 
France and Germany, the examination has been limited to 
particular spots, while large districts have been almost over- 
looked. Of all countries Great Britain has been most 
minutely investigated, and its ablest naturalists, having accom- 
plished so much at home, are widely extending their researches 
to remote countries. 

It would be invidious, even were it compatible with the plan 
of the present essay, to particularise the contributions to this 
department of natural science, in England, since the publi- 
cation of the first geological map. A second map, nearly of 
the size of Mr. Smith's, made its appearance shortly after, 
chiefly through the exertions of Mr. Greenough ; and some 
valuable corrections and additional details, contributed by 
that gentleman and by contemporary geologists, were therein 
introduced. The adaptation of the colours which distinguish 
the strata, and define their boundaries with great precision, 
exhibits much judgment, and is not the least of its improve- 



450 Progress of Geology, 

ments. This map has been since engraved upon a reduced 
scale, with the advantage of possessing most of the principal 
observations made during the last ten or twelve years ; and, 
notwithstanding some obvious minor defects, as a guide to the 
scientific English traveller, cannot be too highly commended. 

Mr. Farey completed an elaborate mineralogical survey of 
Derbyshire, and was long an active contributor, through 
various channels, towards the promotion of a science to whidi 
he was zealously attached. 

It were injustice to the memory of Mr. Parkinson to pass 
unnoticed his Organic Bemains of a former Worlds which 
appeared in 1808; the earliest (except the Fossilia Han- 
toniensia of Salander and Brander), the most elaborate, and 
certainly the most magnificent, work that issued from the Bri- 
tish press, in illustration of a department of natural history 
then little understood. This, and a subsequent Introduction 
to the Study of Organic Remains^ have placed their author in 
the first class of naturalists. But English geology at that 
period w^as quite in its infancy. Little was known of dis- 
tinctions in strata; and, as the fossils were classed without 
regard to geological arrangement, the utility of the work was 
considerably lessened. Of this imperfection the author ap- 
pears to have been aware in his preface to the concluding 
volume. 

The unavoidable deficiencies here alluded to have been, in 
a great measure, supplied by Mr. Sowerby's Mineral Concho- 
logy of Great Britain, The first portion of the work had also 
the disadvantage of appearing before the nomenclature and 
true position of the formations were determined; a circum- 
stance which has disturbed the uniformity of the plan, but 
which a carefully compiled general index, or rather a good 
series of indexes, will materially rectify. This unrivalled pro- 
duction, commenced in 1812, and continued to the present 
time, does honour to the name of this distinguished naturalist 
and his sons, and will long remain among the most useful, as 
it is one of the most splendid, acquisitions to the science it so 
beautifully illustrates. 

Mr. Bakewell published a useful Introduction to Geology in 
1813, the third edition of which has been recently printed, 
comprising much valuable additional matter- The views of 
this gentleman on some points relating to the arrangement of 
rocks, and their analogies to Continental formations, ditier 
somewhat from those currently adopted by English geologists, 
but demand all the respect to which so experienced an autho- 
rity is entitled. 



progress of Geology. 451 

In the same year, 1813, appeared a translation of Baron 
Cuvier*s Essay on the Theory of the Earth, with notes, by Pro- 
fessor Jameson. This work, so deservedly celebrated, which 
has contributed so much to extend the taste in this country 
for such pursuits, reached its fifth edition in 1827. Few 
scientific essays have been studied with such interest as this ; 
and so strongly do the sentiments impress themselves on the 
memory of the reader, that it would be difficult to point out 
a modern geological writer who has not unconsciously adopted 
some expressions of its eloquent author. 

About the same time some highly interesting discoveries 
were made, by Mr. Webster, in the Isle of Wight and on the 
southern coast of England, which established some remarkable 
facts relative to the vertical strata in that quarter, and the co- 
incidence between the fresh-water formations in the basin of 
Paris and those, previously unknown, in the Isle of Wight. 
To the talents of this gentleman, both as an artist and an 
accurate observer, science is under great obligations. 

For elucidations of the natural history of those obscure 
tribes, the Encrinites, the Belemnites, and other animals allied 
to them, we are indebted to the labours of Mr. Miller. 

Messrs. Coneybeare and Phillips, authors of Outlines of the 
Geology of England and Wales, have, in that useful treatise, 
made us acquainted, in detail, with the entire series of deposits 
from the tertiary to the carboniferous class. The introductory 
compendium of the general principles of geology is the best 
of its kind ; and we may be excused, if, during the progress of 
the following pages, we occasionally draw our information from 
a source so authentic. In a field so extensive and so newly 
explored, it would be remarkable, indeed, if some omissions, 
some unintentional inaccuracies, were not occasionally dis- 
coverable ; yet such is the value which we, in common widi 
other practical enquirers, attach to these Outliries, that we 
cannot but regard the period of their appearance as an epoch 
in the progress of the science. It only remains for us to 
express the hope that the second volume, so long delayed, 
will ere long make its appearance. 

Many occasional writers, particularly the contributors to 
the Transactions of the Geological Societies of London, Edin- 
burgh, and Cornwall, the Royal Societies of London and 
Edinburgh, the Wernerian Society, and the Cambridge Phi- 
losophical Society, have elucidated various portions of our 
mineral and mountain districts, or have exhibited much sagacity 
in unravelling the zoological labyrinth of a former world. 

The geological professors at Oxford and Cambridge have 
each largely and liberally contributed to our knowledge of the 



452 Progress of Geology, 

structure of our island ; and the names of Buckland and 
Sedgewick have long been classed with the profoundest in- 
vestigators of our times. 

In the department of comparative anatomy, interesting 
results have attended the researches of Dr. Buckland, Mr. 
Clift, Mr. Pentland, Mr. Mantell, Sir Everard Home, and 
Mr. Coneybeare.* The volcanic phenomena have been ably 
illustrated by Mr. Scrope and Dr. Daubeny. 

There is some difficulty in determining where to pause. 
Were we to enumerate all those who have assisted in the 
advancement of English geology, the list would extend fur- 
ther than is compatible with the plan of our sketch ; but the 
names of several of these authorities will occur as we proceed. 

While the naturalists of Great Britain were rewarded by 
so many interesting discoveries, others, not less important, 
resulted from the researches of their foreign contemporaries, 
Cuvier, Humboldt, Brongniart, Lamarck, and other scientific 
men in France, Italy, Germany, and in more remote parts of 
the earth. 

The examinations of our own countrymen have likewise 
been widely extended, and there are few parts of the world 
which have not been subjected, more or less, to the inspection 
of British geologists. For improving our knowledge of the 
structure of Southern and Western Europe we are indebted 
to Dr. Buckland, Mr. Bakewell, Mr. Scrope, Dr. Daubeny, 
Sir A. Crichton, Dr. Fitton, Mr. Coneybeare, Dr. Trail, and 
Mr. De la Beche ; of Russia, to Mr. Strangeways ; of Hungary, 
to Dr. Bright; of Jamaica, to Mr. De la Beche and Mr. 
Bennett ; of Antigua, to Dr. Nugent ; of Ceylon, to Dr. Davy ; 
of the Straits of Magellan, to Captain King; of Rio de Ja- 
neiro, to Mr. Caldcleugh ; the southern and western parts of 
the Canadas, to Dr. Bigsby ; and the coast of Labrador, to 
the Rev. Mr. Steinhauer ; the northern coasts of America, to 
Captain Franklin and Dr. Richardson ; and of some portion 
of the Arctic regions, to the scientific gentlemen attached to 
the expedition commanded by Captain Parry. 

In India geological investigations have been pursued by 
Mr. Colebrooke, Mr. Eraser, Messrs. S. and B. Babington, 
Dr. Adam, and Mr. Craufurd ; and the latter gentleman has 
recently brought a magnificent collection of fossil animal re- 
mains from Ava. Captain James Franklin has illustrated the 
geology of a portion of Central India by a map and memoir. 

• Mr. Weaver has described the fossil elk of Ireland ; and Mr. Konig, 
of the British Museum, has commenced a work on fossils, under the title of 
Icones FossUium Sectilcs. 



Progress of Geology, 453 

The science is also indebted to the researches of Dr. Skey 
in Barbadoes, of Dr. Nugent in the Isles of Trinidad and 
Montserrat, of Captain Veitch in the Island of Bermuda, and 
Dr. Jack in Sumatra. 

With regard to the history of geological discovery, much 
valuable information is comprised in a series of masterly articles 
in the Edinburgh Revieis)^ commencing in 1811, and continued, 
at intervals, to a late period. In the Qiiarterhj Bevieiio also, 
and in several of the scientific journals, geological communi- 
cations of high character and value have occasionally ap- 
peared. Nor ought we to omit to notice, in this place, 
the able address delivered by Dr. Fitton, President of the 
Geological Society, at the Annual Meeting of the Fellows, 
February 15. 1828. 

When we consider the short time that geology has been 
pursued as a science of induction, the enormous area sub- 
mitted to examination, and the prodigious mass of unques- 
tionable facts which have been established, we cannot but 
exult at the progress which has been made, and at the elevated 
station it now holds. 

While new discoveries are daily occurring, while doubtful 
points are from time to time receiving elucidation, and many 
desiderata continue to be supplied, the time is perhaps still 
remote when it may be asserted that the work of English 
geologists is done, and their acquaintance with the structure 
even of their own country is cpmplete. Even now we are 
familiar with little more than the most prominent features of 
some formations. The subordinate details remain to be filled 
up, and will afford scope for the investigations of an increasing 
class of observers. In almost all our great provincial towns, 
institutions have been established within a very short period, 
having, amongst other objects, those of facilitating the study 
of local geology, and forming illustrative collections of mine- 
ralogical and fossil substances. To most of these associations 
lectureships are attached ; and museums of natural history, 
mineralogy, and comparative anatomy are founded, and r^idly 
augment. Thus the advantages which at first exclusively 
appertained to the parent institutions of the metropolis, are 
placed within the reach of a very extensive class of society. 
The time may be distant ere these local museums will rival 
the noble collections in some Continental universities; but, 
originating in the improved state of society, they are supported 
with energy. The foundations are laid ; the nuclei are formed, 
around which are rapidly concentrating vast masses of matter, 
available to the interests of science, to an extent we are 
scarcely able to appreciate.

454 Modification of Clouds 

Art. XI. On the Modification of Clouds called Wind Reels, 
By J. Rennie, A.m. 

The names which have been given to different species of 
clouds by Mr. Luke Howard, are now pretty generally known 
and adopted in meteorological journals ; but, though the author 
(naturally enough,, no doubt) deprecates the attempts which 
have been made to substitute English terms for his Latin 
ones, there can be little question that his learned nomenclature 
has retarded the popularity of the science. If this be the fact, 
as it, indeed, appears to be, it will be preferable to adopt such 
English terms as may be more intelligible to the general reader. 

The species of cloud, therefore, which is called Cirrus by 
Mr. Howard, may be conveniently termed the "jDane-cloud, 
being the thinnest, lightest, and highest of all the clouds : as 
if the accumulated vapour which composes the lower and 
denser clouds had waned away, by its distance and elevation. 
The different forms which the wane-cloud assumes, in conse- 
quence of atmospheric changes, may be equally designated by 
English as by Latin terms. The modification which falls to 
be noticed at present, is called, by the peasants in Kent, "doind- 
reels, from the notion that the streaks lie in the direction of 
the wind. That the current of the wind may have some in- 
fluence in the arrangement of those streaks of wane-cloud, is 
not improbable : but that some portions of the cloud are not 
influenced by the wind, is proved by the streaks which may 
often be observed to cross the main lines at various angles ; in 
some instances, indeed, so regularly, as to make a part of the 
sky look like network. 

A very beautiful instance of the wind reel fell under my ob- 
servation, on the 20th of May, 1828. The wind was N. W., 
light, warm, and there had been a succession of dry weather 
for many days, a circumstance which is popularly supposed 
to influence the formation of such clouds ; with some justice, 
perhaps, as they seem to be frequently the forerunners of rain ; 
the first nucleus, as it were, of the gathering rain-cloud. One 
of the streaks spanned the entire visible horizon, from N. W. 
to S. E., in an uninterrupted and nearly uniform arch, about 
the usual dimensions of a rainbow, though not so well defined, 
as I have endeavoured to represent in the following sketch. 
(^.198.) This arched cloud was accompanied by others, 
conterminous with it, and nearly parallel with respect to the 
direction of their component streaks. These appeared to verge 
to a point ; but this was, probably, a common optical decep- 
tion, depending on the laws of perspective ; at least, this is the 
received opinion of meteorologists respecting arched clouds. I 
am disposed, however, to think that the phenomenon cannot 



called Wind Reels. 



455 



be always referred to optical deception ; for I have, more than 
once, observed arched clouds in vai'ious positions and direc- 



198 




tions, with regard to the eye, which they could not have ap- 
peared in according to this supposition. 

I continued to observe and admire those arched lines of 
cloud for several hours, namely, from noon till between four 
and five in the evening ; and, what was remarkable, though 
there was a light but steady breeze of wind in the direction 
of the arched lines, the form of the cloud remained nearly 
stationary, and uniform in its outline. Now, are we to infer 
from this, that a thin light stream of vapour, spread over the 
whole extent of the horizon, and acted upon, for four or 
five hours, by a breeze of wind, would neither be evaporated 
nor moved from its position ? The affirmative would be the 
natural inference; but Mr. Daniell, in his excellent Essays on 
Meteorology^ has endeavoured to account for the apparent sta- 
tionary phenomena of clouds, in so very ingenious and satis- 
factory a manner, that I hesitate not to adopt his explanation. 
" The apparent permanency," says Mr. Daniell, " and 
stationary aspect of a cloud, is oflen an optical deception, aris- 
ing from the solution of moisture on one side of a given point, 
as it is precipitated on the other. No phenomenon is more 
common amongst mountains, or upon hills by the sea-side, 
than clouds upon the summits, which appear to be perfectly 
immovable, although a strong wind is blowing upon them at 
the time. That this should be the real state of the case, is 
clearly impossible, as so attenuated a body as constitutes the 
substances of the clouds must obey the impulse of the air. 



456 Modification of Clouds 

The real fact is, that the vapour which is wafted by the wind, 
is precipitated by the cold contact of the mountain, and is 
urged forward on its course till, borne beyond the influence 
which caused its condensation, it is again exhaled, and disap- 
pears. A slight inspection and consideration of the pheno- 
mena will be sufficient to convince any one of the correctness 
of this explanation. Reasoning from analogy, we may con- 
clude that the process which thus proceeds, under our eyes, 
upon the summits of the hills, likewise takes place on either 
side of the planes of precipitation in the heights of the atmo- 
sphere ; the vapour is continually condensed, as continually re- 
dissolved in the act of precipitation, and the cloud appears to 
be unchanged and stationary." (Page 124., first edition.) 

According to the electro-chemical theory of the formation of 
clouds, however, it would be affirmed that the cloud was really 
stationary and unchanged, in consequence of the equilibrium 
of the electrical influence produced by the primary develope- 
ment of the cloud, from the union of the constituent principles 
of water previously existing in the gaseous state. It is barely 
possible to apply the ingenious reasoning of Mr. Daniell to 
this theory, and to suppose that, while the mist or vapour 
constituting the cloud is forming upon one side, the water is 
simultaneously decomposed on the other side. 

We are still too much in the dark, with respect to the prin- 
ciples that regulate atmospherical phenomena, to decide upon 
the precise effects of electricity ; but, supposing the theory 
alluded to has some foundation in nature, we may be tempted 
to proceed a step farther, and connect it with the nearly 
allied influence of magnetism. Indeed, without some such 
power acting upon the light and movable streaks and tufts of 
vapour which form what I call wane-clouds (Cii^ms, Howard), 
I cannot devise any satisfactory explanation of the appearances 
which may so frequently be observed ; for, if the wind were 
the sole agent in determining their forms and positions, they 
ought always to stream in the direction of its current, as we 
see is uniformly the case in the analogous instance of smoke. 
In the case of wane-clouds, however, they as frequently appear 
to cross, or lie obliquely to the current of the wind which blows 
in the plane of their stratification, as the contrary ; and, some- 
times, they may be seen in positions simultaneously so dissi- 
milar, that it seems difficult to refer the direction of any 
particular tuft or streak to any known agent. As an instance 
of this, I sketched the following (^^. 199.), a few days after the 
occurrence of the preceding arched wane-cloud. The wind, it 
is true, was easterly in the general direction of the streaks ; 
but besides the shorter crossing streaks at a {Jig, 198), which 



called Wind Reels. 



457 



were almost at right angles to the current of the wind, there 
were long streams extending over half the visible horizon, di- 
varicating very considerably from the parallelism of the line 
which mS'ked the direction of the wind. Might it not be that 
some, at least, if not all, of the lines of cloud were in a position 
corresponding with what mathematicians call the resultant of 



199 




two forces, which, in this case, I assume to be the current of 
the wind and terrestrial magnetism ? So far, at least, I am 
certain that those long lines of wane-cloud very frequently lie 
in directions corresponding, or nearly corresponding, with 
the magnetic meridian ; and, if magnetism has no influence 
over them, the coincidence must be confessed to be singular and 
unaccountable. 

It would be wrong, however, to venture upon any positive 
assertion of this theory, or rather speculation, in the deficiency 
of well-ascertained facts ; but, from the analogous arrangement 
between the wane-clouds figured above, and the streaks of the 
aurora borealis, which is also supposed to be connected with 
magnetism or electricity, I think that farther investigation may 
elucidate the dependence of the phenomena on the same 
causes. The aurora borealis, indeed, is almost always in the 
direction of the magnetic meridian, while the wane-clouds in 
question, so far as I have remarked, are more under the in-? 
fluence of the current of wind blowing in the plane of their 
stratification.

Art. XII. On Water-Spouts. 

Water-spouts make their appearance from the bosom of 
a heavy cloud, such as that represented at {Jig.20(^ a), gra- 
dually descending in a point like an inverted cone, sometimes 
perpendicularly, and sometimes bending, or waved. The 
weight and velocity of such a body of water falling into the 

200 




sea, agitate and throw up the water around in a suiprising 
manner, as represented at b, till it is exhausted, when it dis- 
appears gradually as it began. It is obvious that the pheno- 
menon is caused by a change in the atmosphere when full of 
clouds, by different contrary currents of air opposing one an- 
other, perhaps in the same manner as may be seen in streams 
of water, which, by the intervention of some body are variously 
thrown into whirlpools, which by their circular motion carry 
down a conical column of air in their centres. 

In this manner we may suppose, that when the atmosphere 
is surcharged with gross and heavy vapours, put into violent 
motion by the impulse of contending winds, one of which must 
prove the most powerful, they may force one another into a 
circular or spiral motion, as at figure c, to the centre of which 
the grossest and heaviest parts inclining, as is the case in all 
fluid bodies, form into a body which we see descend. The 
body is of various sizes ; one seen at about a mile distant ap- 
peared to be about 5 ft. in diameter ; but there are some seen 
much larger. It cannot be ascertained from their appearance, 
whether they are solid or hollow in the centre.

With the exception of botany, perhaps, there is no branch 
of natural history so fascinating as the study of insects, par- 
ticularly to the young ; that is, if the bias of opening curiosity 
be properly directed. It is the common every-day practice in 
most families, to teach children, from the earliest infancy, to 
treat the greater number of insects as if they were serpents, 
venomous and dangerous, and of course meriting to be de- 
stroyed, or at least avoided with horror, wherever they are 
met with. Associations are by this means linked with the very 
appearance of insects, which become gradually more inveterate 
with advancing years, provided, as most frequently happens, 
the same system be persisted in of avoiding or destroying 
almost every insect which is unlucky enough to attract observ- 
ation. How much rational amusement and innocent pleasure 
are thus thoughtlessly lost, and how many disagreeable feel> 
ings created in the most absurd and foolish manner, we shall 
be fully able, we hope, to show as w^e proceed. 

To prove that the study, or (if the word be disliked) the 
observation, of insects is peculiarly fascinating to children, even 
in their years of infancy, we may refer to what we have seen 
in the family of a friend, who is partial to this, as well as to 
all the departments of natural history. Our friend's children, 
a boy and a girl, were taught from the moment they could 
distinguish insects, to treat them as objects of interest and 
curiosity, and not to be afraid even of those which wore the 
most repulsive appearance. The little girl, for example, when 
just beginning to walk alone, encountered one day a large 

I I. 2 



460 StepJiens*s British Entomology. 

Staphyliniis, which she fearlessly seized, and did not quit her 
hold, though the insect grasped one of her fingers in his for- 
midable jaws. The mother, who was by, knew enough of the 
insect to be rather alarmed for the consequences, though she 
prudently concealed her feelings from the child. She did well ; 
for the insect was not strong enough to break the skin, and the 
child took no notice of his attempts to bite her finger. A whole 
series of disagreeable associations with this formidable-looking 
family of insects was in this manner averted, at the very moment 
when a different mode of acting on the part of the mother would 
have produced the first link of the chain. For more than two 
years after this occurrence, this little girl and her brother as- 
sisted in adding numerous specimens of insects to their father*s 
collection, without the parents ever having had cause, from any 
accident, to repent of their employing themselves in this man- 
ner. The sequel of the little girl's history strikingly illustrates 
the position for which we contend. Family embarrassments 
rendered it expedient for the child to be sent to a relative in 
the country, where she was not long of having carefully in- 
stilled into her mind all the usual antipathies against "every 
thing that creepeth upon the earth;" and though she after- 
wards returned to her paternal home, no persuasion nor remon- 
strance could ever again persuade her to touch a common 
beetle, much less a Staphylinus, with its tail turned up in a 
threatening attitude, and its formidable jaws ready for attack 
or defence. 

But while we contend for the advantages in point of plea- 
sure alone, though science be left out of our consideration, we 
would not be understood as carrying the matter to extremes. 
Our meaning is, that while children are taught to look upon 
all insects as objects of interesting observation, they ought, at 
the same time, to be carefully warned of those which may do 
them injury, such as bees, wasps, and ants, and among the 
beetles, the male stag-beetle (Z/Ucanus cervus), whose bite, or 
rather pinch, is not a little painful. Nothing, however, can be 
more absurd, than the fear universally entertained in England 
of the larger sorts of dragon-flies (Libellulida?), which are 
branded with the erroneous name of /wrse-sti?igers, though the 
most superficial examination will demonstrate that these insects 
have not a shadow of a sting : but their jaws are large and 
strong; not stronger, however, than those of the Staphylinus 
above mentioned, and of course not dangerous in the slightest 
degree, even to infants. 

Holding these views to be important, in reference to early 
education and to the multiplying of the pleasures of youth, 
manhood, and old age, we cannot but cordially hail the pub- 



Stephefis's British E7ttomology._ +6 1 

lication of every work which is calculated to extend them, by 
pointing out subjects of observation, and thus leading the in- 
quisitive and the curious from the known to the unknown in 
the productions of nature. Mr. Stephens's book is eminently 
calculated to efFect that purpose in many respects, though its 
extensive plan, and the elegant manner in which it is got up, 
render it by necessity too expensive for very general circula- 
tion. In the two volumes now before us, the author has 
furnished us with the best (in numerous instances with the 
only) account which has hitherto been given of our native in- 
sects, and as he has not copied his descriptions from books, 
but given the result of his personal observations upon the spe- 
cimens in his own rich, if not unrivalled, cabinet, the confidence 
of the student in the author's accuracy is thereby strongly 
corroborated. 

The author follows the two leading divisions of insects pro- 
posed by Clairville, namely Ma7idibuldta, comprehending insects 
furnished with mandibles, or jaws ; and Haustelldta, compre- 
hending insects furnished with haustella, or suckers. These 
he divides into orders, and subdivides into sections, sub-sec- 
tions, families, genera, species, and varieties. As his orders 
are somewhat difFerent from, those hitherto proposed, and 
withal moi'e distinctly characterised, we shall take the liberty 
of giving in English what the author has put down in Latin 
in his tabular sketches. It may be remarked that he is an 
advocate for the circular system of Macleay, though he does not 
follow his quinary divisions ; the septenary (as he appears to 
think) being more suited to his orders. The following num- 
bers, therefore, are supposed to return reciprocally into one 
another.

2. Sfrepstptera, — The upper wings more or less coria- 
ceous ; the under wings contorted ; as in Xenos.

This sketch, slight as it is, will enable our readers, with a 
very little attention, to class any insect with which they happen 
to meet ; but for ample, clear and scientific descriptions of the 
genera, species, and varieties, recourse must be had to the 
work itself. It is but justice, however, to Mr. Stephens to add, 
that he has by no means limited himself to a mere description 
of insects. He has in many cases entered minutely into their 
economy, and into details connected with utility. Speaking, 
for example, of the larvae of the Adephaga of Clairville, a 
section of the order Coleoptera, he says : — 

" They voraciously devour worms and the larvsB of all other 
insects, as well as perfect insects ; though the larvae of Zabrus 
gibbus are said to destroy young wheat, and a long account of 
their devastations, in the canton of Seeburg, near Halle, in 
Germany, is given in the first volume of Germar's Magazine 
der Entomologies wherein it is stated, that they were accompanied 
with a large proportion of the herbivorous larvae of Melolon- 
tha ruficornis. May not," Mr. Stephens adds in a note, " these 
herbivorous larvae have been the principal cause of the mis- 
chief to the wheat, while those of the Zabrus contributed rather 
to lessen their numbers than to destroy the corn." (vol. i. p. 4.) 

" And is it not probable that the perfect insects ascend the 
corn for the purpose of devouring the parasite insects thereon ? 
This is a subject that requires investigation, as it is highly 
important for the interests of the agriculturists, in those dis- 
tricts where the insect abounds (as at Worthing, Brighton, 
Hastings, Cambridge), that the question should be thoroughly 
set at rest ; because, should the 2Sabri depart from the habits

of the group to which they belong, and become herbivorous 
instead of carnivorous, their destruction would be desirable ; 
while, on the contrary, if they destroy the devourers of our 
produce, their preservation should be attempted." (vol. i. 
p. 140.) 

Did our space permit, we could multiply extracts of similar 
interest, though the merit of the work does not depend so 
much on details of this kind, as on its profound, minute, and 
accurate science, in which department Mr. Stephens could not 
be easily surpassed. We cannot but heartily wish all success 
to a work so eminently deserving the patronage of the British 
public. J. R.

We have no wish to retract the very favourable opinion 
which we expressed of this work, when it was first put into 
our hands (see p. 280.) ; but, in order to put it in the power 
of our readers to judge for themselves, we shall now give 
some account of its plan and execution. 

The author, as will appear from the title, has rejected (we 
think, wisely) the obsolescent catechetical method formerly so 
fashionable, and has in some measure followed the classical 
models of Xenophon, Plato, and Cicero. This, it has been 
observed by a contemporary reviewer, as a method of exciting 
interest and affording room for apt illustrations, is immeasur- 
ably beyond the clumsy, dry, and lifeless plan too frequently 
followed, of question and answer, inasmuch as it carries with 
it the thread of a narrative, which the question and answer 
system is perpetually snapping asunder. According to the 
latter plan, we might expect, in a Catechism of Geology, some 
such beginning as the following : —

464 Conversations on Geology, 

Now, as a contrast to this, let us see how the subject is 
managed in the conversational style, by the author under re- 
view. We quote from the opening of the first conversation, 
premising that the speakers are Mrs. R. and her two children, 
Edward and Christina, each of whom is characterised by 
peculiarities of sentiment and style of thinking. 

" Edward. — Sea-shells, did you say, mother, in the heart of solid rocks, 
and far inland ? There must surely be some mistake in this ; at least it 
appears to me to be incredible. 

" Mrs. R. — Incredible as you suppose it to be, my dear boy, you may 
see it with your own eyes in the marble of this chimney-piece, which you 
may perceive is throughout studded with shells, as if they were fresh from 
the sea. They even retain, as you perceive, their original nacre^ as the 
French call the peculiar lustre of mother-of-pearl. 

" Chinstina. — Ah, so they do ; but, I dare say, it is only a good imitation 
of shells made on the marble. There is a very pretty one on the lid of my 
work-box, which is certainly artificial ; and those in the marble may have 
been done in the same way. 

** Mrs. R. — But, my dear, there is no nacre on the shell on your work- 
box ; and it is evident, indeed, that it is wholly made of pieces of stained 
wood, ingeniously put together : but the shells in the marble are real 
shells, as you may see, differing in nothing from those we find on the sea- 
shore. 

" Edward. — Then how could they come into the marble ? It must 
have been soft, like paste, or have been precipitated or deposited, as we say 
in chemistry, over the shells j for they are distributed, as I perceive, through 
its substance. 

** Mrs. R. — Yes; and if you were to break the marble into a thousand 
fragments, you would find a shell in almost every one of them. 

" Christina. — Is there any history of these curious shells, mother ? I 
should like above all things to read it. I suppose it must be something 
like the stories I have seen of living toads found in the heart of growing 
trees. 

" Mrs. R. — The history of the shells, my dear, and many other things 
no less wonderful, is given in the science called Geology, which treats of 
the first appearance of rocks, mountains, vallies, lakes, and rivers, and the 
changes they have undergone from the creation and the deluge till the 
present time." (p. 3.) 

As a considerable portion of the volume is devoted to the 
two rival theories of the earth, proposed by Hutton and by 
Werner, whose several disciples have been named Vulcanisis 
and Neptimists, because the former advocates the agency of 
fire, and the latter the agency of water, in the formation of 
the crust of the earth, we shall give a short sketch of the 
leading doctrines of both systems, nearly in the words of .our 
author : — 

' For the purpose of making a globe like the earth, with seas, continents, 
and islands, diversified with hills and vallies, and productive of food for 
various animals. Dr. Hutton considered it as indispensable that other globes 
should have previously existed, from which materials for the structure might 
be derived. These supposititious woHds being acted on by the moist atmo- 
sphere, by rains, and by the frosts and thaws of winter and spring, would, in 



Convet'satiofis on Geology, 465 

a long course of years, be crumbled down, or, as the geologists say, disin- 
tegrated, and gradually carried by rivers, in the form of sand, clay, and 
gravel, to the sea. At the bottom of the sea these materials would arrange 
themselves in beds, differing in thickness, according to the circumstances by 
which they might be affected. But those beds would have continued in the 
soft state of sand or clay for ever, unless something occurred to harden 
them. It is here that Dr. Hutton brings in the agency of fire, and tells us, 
that there is at the bottom of the sea sufficient heat, from a great central 
fire which he conceives to exist in the centre of the globe, to melt all the 
clay, sand, and gravel, and to form them into rocks. He provides for the 
appearance of these above water, by supposing that the central fire occa- 
sionally expands itself, and elevates the newly formed rocks into islands and 
continents, diversified by hills and vallies ; these being destined in their 
turn to the same changes of destruction and renovation, as those from which 
they took their origin.* (p. 47 — 50.) 

* According to the rival geological theorist, Werner, all the substances 
which now constitute rocks, mountains, and soil on the earth's surface, were 
originally existing, in a state of solution, in the waters of the great chaos, 
which he supposes at the beginning to have surrounded the globe to a vast 
depth. The substances or materials of rocks, thus swimming in the primi- 
tive ocean, he conceives to have gradually fallen to the bottom, sometimes 
by chemical, sometimes by mechanical means, and sometimes by both to- 
gether ; and in this manner, he thinks, all the rocks have been formed which 
we now find on digging into the earth. The inequalities of mountains and 
vallies on the surface of the earth, which were thus produced as soon as the 
waters began to subside (and this subsidence is an important point in the 
system), gradually rose out of the primitive sea, forming the first dry land. 
The rocks which were in this manner first formed, Werner calls the Ori- 
ginal or Primitive Formation : they consist of granife, gneiss, different species 
of slate, marble, and trap. 

* The formation of these rocks, however, did not, it seems, exhaust the 
materials floating in the waters, for the deposition went on, and a class of 
rocks were formed consisting of grey wack^ limestone, and trap, which 
rested on the primitive, and are called by Werner the Intermediate ar 
Transition Rocks, because, on their appearance above the waters, the earth, 
he conceives, passed into a habitable state. 

* After the formation of those primitive and transition rocks, Werner 
alleges that the water suddenly rose over them to a great height, covering 
them in many places, as it again subsided, with a new formation of rocks, 
consisting of sandstone, conglomerates, limestone, gypsum, chalk, and rock- 
salt, which he called Level or Floetz Rocks. 

* Since that period, the wearing down of the rocks, by the action of the 
weather and other causes, and the washing away of the worn materials by 
rains and streams of water, have formed soil, gravel, sand, peat, and the 
various other beds which are called AlluviaU (p. 58 — 60.) 

Into the details of these two systems, and the numerous 
objections to their several opinions, started and explained in 
the Conversations, we have not room to enter ; and much less 
can we take up at present the still more rational and plau- 
sible system which Mr. Granville Penn has constructed from

is also fully treated of in the latter part of the volume. Our 
readers, however, may like to see a list of the subjects treated

explained by Mr. Penn; Bones and shells in rocks and

It may be objected to these Co?iversations on Geology, that 
they contain too many objections, and leave many parts of the 
subject in utter uncertainty : but we may be permitted to reply 
to this, that all the systems of geology are precisely in the 
state in which they are here represented, uncertain and imper- 
fect in their theories and speculations ; though these are gene- 
rally illustrated by interesting and well ascertained facts, and 
sufficiently plausible arguments. The author of the Convei- 
sations, therefore, it would appear to us, has acted judiciously 
in representing the actual imperfections of geology, rather 
than concealing them, and in expressing doubts upon points 
imperfectly ascertained, rather than dogmatising.

EPiNALy Oct. 15. — There is a small miscellaneous Museum here, but it 
is more remarkable for Roman sculptures and coins dug up in the neigh- 
bourhood, than for specimens of natural history. The attention to this 
science, however, is increasing, as appears both by the specimens lately pur- 
chased and added to the collection, and by the communications to a very 
useful periodical which appears here every three months, Le Journal de la 
Societe d^F/mulation. There is a tolerable collection of minerals, and a 
number of precious stones of different kinds procured from the shrines of 
saints, or sacred relics of monasteries or convents, formerly existing in the 
department of the Vosges. A number of pearls have lately been taken from 
the fresh-water muscle (ilf ja margaritlfera), found here in the river Valogne ; 
and when the Duchess of Angouleme, who lately visited Epinal, saw those 
in the museum, she very patriotically ordered a necklace from the director 
and librarian, M. Petit-Jean, a liberal minded excellent man, who seemed 
to us to unite the best parts of the French and English character. 

Strasburgy Oct. 19. — The Museum of Natural History here contains 
an extensive collection. It is more than usually rich in corals, sponges, 
Rtar-fish, and marine Mollusca. There is an excellent specimen of Asterias 
caput Medustr, a great number of Gorgonia, of Scalaria speciosa, and of 
Cypr«^'a, and a pair of gloves manufactured from the fibres of Pinna nobi- 
lis. There is an excellent collection of birds, especially those of Alsatia, 
which is rich in this division of animals, and cont^iins some species found 
but in few other countries. Several species of owls, birds in which Alsatia 
is very prolific. 5trix uralensis (the owl of the Ural mountains), rare, and 
worth fifty Napoleons. Certhia muraria, only found in Alsatia. TYochilidaB, 
a large collection. Charadrius gallicus and Phaenicopterus ruber, found on 
the banks of the Rhine. A considerable collection of fishes. Diodon ma- 
culatus. A good specimen of the rattle-snake. ^Sorex moscellatus, from 
Siberia, very rare, presented by Pallas. Myrmecophaga jubata, the ant- 
eater, a remarkably fine specimen. Sciuropterus volucdla. One of the best 
collections of butterflies in existence out of Paris and Vienna ; and the same 
may be said of the collection of organic remains, and petrified productions. 
Phys^ter macrocdphalus, the iiead and part of the vertebrae. Large frag- 
ments of mammoths, elephants, hyenas, and other fossil quadrupeds. A 
good collection of minerals. Hyalia roule, a species of quartz found in the 
Rhine, but rare. A collection of the minerals of Alsatia, with those which 
have been applied to purposes of utility particularly indicated. 

An apartment devoted to vegetable productions, contains the section of 
the trunk of a silver fir tree (^'bies picea), called Le grand Sapin de Hoch- 
wald, a forest at Barr, in Alsatia. This tree was 1 50 ft. high, with a trunk 
perfectly straight and free from branches to the height of 50 ft., after which it 
was forked with the one bhoot 100 ft. long, and the other somewhat shorter. 
The diameter of the trunk at the surface of the ground was 8 ft. ; at 50 ft. 



Natiral Histoiy in Foreign Cmmtries, 469 

from the ground, 5 ft. ; estimated age, 360 years. It was cut down on the 
3d of June, 1816, the branches having begun to wither at the top, and the 
trunk to liecay at the centre. There is another silver fir tree standing near 
where this one stood, nearly of the same height, and estimated to be of 
the same age. The forest of Hochwald (High-wood, in allusion probably 
to the height of the trees) consists almost entirely of silver firs, and before 
the revolution belonged to the town of Strasburg. 

There is a good collection of specimens of different kinds of timber, 
which, instead of exhibiting a series of polished tablets, as is generally the 
case, consists of oblique sections of the trunk with the bark on, of the ave- 
rage size which the trunk attains. Specimens polished, and otherwise 
manufactured, are also exhibited ; so that the collection becomes at once 
instructive to the botanist, and to the cabinet-maker and joiner. It also 
contains a collection of seeds, with their pods and other integuments or 
receptacles, arranged according to the natural system, amongst which the 
different cones of the Coniferae, and the pods of Leguminosae, form very 
interesting assemblages; and a herbarium, arranged after the manner of 
Jussieu. 

The whole of this museum is in excellent order. Among the quadrupeds 
and birds there is no appearance of moths, and at the same time no smell 
of camphor, or other preservative ingredients. On enquiring of M. Vinet 
what means he used to preserve in such excellent condition the objects un- 
der his care, he answered, " Nothing more- than frequently inspecting them, 
airing them, gently brushing them over, or wiping off any thing extraneous, 
and keeping the cases perfectly clean.'* He observed that camphor, pepper, 
cedar wood, savine, &c., which were used by some housewives to keep moths 
from clothes, had been found perfectly useless if the clothes were not fre- 
quently taken out, brushed, and aired ; and that if clothes were taken out 
frequently, and brushed and aired, no camphor or "other ingredient was ne- 
cessary to keep them from the moth, or other insects. The idea occurred to 
him that what held good in keeping furs, leather, woollen cloth, feathers, and 
other articles of dress, free from moths, might hold good in preserving the 
same articles in their unmanufactured state, and he tried it and was success- 
ful. The same idea has been applied in England to the keeping of speci- 
mens of plants, which require to be frequently turned over. To convince 
himself and others of the uselessness of camphor and other nostrums alone, 
M. Vinet has hatched moths in an atmosphere impregnated with camphor, 
and the other substances mentioned. This hint, as to the preservation 
of articles of dress made from animal substances, will, we know, not be lost 
on our female readers. 

M. Vinet, besides being the keeper of this museum, collects and prepares 
objects of natural history for sale, and sends the natural productions of Al- 
satia to other countries. 

The Botanic Garden here contains a tolerable collection, the hardy 
plants arranged in the Jussieuean manner. There are some good specimens 
of exotic trees and shrubs, of which the most remarkable is a Salisburia 
fldiantifolia, the male plant, as in England, and almost every where else in 
Europe, which flowers freely every year ! It is about 18 ft. high, and has 
no leading shoot, having been completely overshadowed for many years by 
an immense Populus angulata, which was taken down about twelve years 
ago. Professor Nestler conjectures that the change of circumstances pro- 
duced by the removal of the poplar, may probably be the cause of the 
inflorescence. A female Salisburj'a is now planted beside the male, raised 
from a bud received from Professor Decandolle, who, some yeai's ago, found 
accidentally, in a garden near Geneva, the only female plant at that time 
known in Europe. We suggested the idea of inserting buds of the female 
plant on the points of the extreme shoots of the male, thinking it probable 
that, by becoming a part of the same tree, it will become sutyect to the

same disposition to produce blossoms. The amentums of the male flower 
are small, like those of the walnut. Other interesting Epecimens are : — : 
Gymnocladus canadensis, which flowers and fruits most abundantly every 
year, and the pods, which remain on the tree till spring, produce a fine effect 
during winter. Juglans nigra, very lai'ge, and bearing immense crops of 
fruit. Qu^rcus C^rris, 100 ft. high, flowers and fruits every year, but the 
fruit never ripens. Aokv monspessulanum, very large. Cornus alternifolia, 
1 8 ft. high. Laurus Sdssafras, Tiburnum nudum, Lentago, and /jrunifolium, 
very large, iycium europae'um, as a standard, laden with fine, large, deep 
red fruit ; very ornamental. L. barbarum beside it, with fewer, smaller, and 
paler-coloured fruit, and with ovate leaves, while the other has lanceolate 
leaves. Xanthoxylum/raxlneum, large; the male and female plant beside 
each other, and ripening seeds every year. A collection of wild gooseber- 
ries and currants, lately collected in the Vosges, among which it is possible 
there may be some new species or varieties. iSonchus Plumieri, also from 
the Vosges ; it grows 5 ft. high, with fine blue flowers, and large succulent 
leaves and stems which might probably be rendered useful in agriculture, 
and possibly even for salading. Lycopodium denticulatum, commonly kept 
in green-houses, and sometimes even in hot-houses, in England, but here 
growing most luxuriantly on a bed of peat, where it remains during winter, 
being covered with loose dry leaves. We may remark that the winters in 
England have at least ten times as many rainy days as those of the north of 
France, and that to render this plan of preservation successful in the for- 
mer country, a covering of boards or of thatch matting would require to be 
suspended over the leaves. 

The Empress Josephine Bonaparte, allowed by all parties to have been 
an excellent woman, and known as a great patroness of botany and garden- 
ing, resided three months at Strasburg in the year 1808. She walked 
almost every day in the botanic garden, conversed respecting the collection 
with the director and the gardener, and sent a number of exotics from Mal- 
maison, among which the following have attained a large size, and some of 
them are obliged to be cut down every year when replaced in their winter 
quarters. Banksia praemorsa, .Schinus Motley Uvularia guineensis ; Acacia 
acanthocarpa, floribunda,and lophantha var. coarctata; i^^icus p^ndula, 12 ft. 
high, and now covered with yellow fruit, about the size of gooseberries j 
Tectona grandis, Cheirostemon julatanoides ; ^aphdrbia 7ieriif61ia, 10 ft. 
high ; Ekeb^rgia capensis; and *S'olanum auriculatum, 10 ft. high, turned out 
of the pot every year in the open garden, where it attains the height of 15ft., 
and forms a magnificent object of its kind, covered with flowers and fruit. 
There are two large date palms, and a number of the other old inhabitants 
of hot-houses, which we need not notice. 

MetZy Dec. 8. — There is a small Cabinet of Natural History here, forme4 
by M. Hollandre, the professor of natural history and botany and the librar 
rian. He has prepared most of the subjects himself, and is obviously wholly 
devoted to natural science. He seems very properly to aim at collecting 
together something of every order in the different classes and families of 
animals and minerals, and has already formed a complete herbal of the 
plants which grow in the neighbourhood of Metz. The animals and birds 
are in cases, fitted up with three or more stories of stages, each stage of 
three or four shelves, according to the size of the subjects to be placed on 
them. As the mineral specimens are small, there are five or six small 
shelves to each stage devoted to that part of the collection. Nothing is 
gained in point of room by these stages, but a great deal in the convenience 
of viewing the objects placed on them. The cabinet tables in the middle 
of the apartment bear glass cases with small objects in the usual manner, 
and their interior contams a stage, facing the light, and enclosed by glazed 
frames, for objects of a larger size. The advantage of the stage disposition 
in reflecting the objects to the eye, is here strikingly obvious. Every spe- 



Natural History in Foreigti Countries. 471 

Cimen is conspicuously named in French, and after Linnaeus or some more 
recent author. There ai-e few Mammalia, but a considerable collection 
of birds, the greater part prepared and mounted by the professor himself. AH 
the birds of the department of the Moselle, and as many as possible of those 
which are indigenous to France, are contained in this collection ; and as 
owls and the falcon family are much more common on the Continent than 
in Britain, these birds make the most conspicuous appearance. There is one 
large sea eagle which was shot in the neighbourhood ; a bird which one 
would not have expected so far in the interior. The Flora of the environs of 
Metz is arranged according to the natural system j each specimen attached 
by narrow slips of paper to the third page of a folio leaf; the class, order, 
family, tribe, name, locality, &c., being inserted on the first page, under 
printed heads or titles, the last of which is " General Remarks." Unfor- 
tunately, the Professor being out of town, we could not ascertain the 
number of families, species, or rare plants ; but we were assured gene- 
rally by M. Clerc, the sub-librarian (whose grandfather, a native of Scot- 
land, accompanied King James to France and settled there), that it was 
rich. M. Clerc is much attached to agriculture and gardening, and was 
a particular friend of the late Baron Tschoudy, of this neighbourhood, 
the inventor of the GreflPe herbac^e. There are a magnificent specimen of 
J^olfetus ramosus, and a very curious fragment of the trunk of a beech tree, 
which the Professor discovered in the street when passing by a man who 
was sawing up some fire-wood. This fragment is a portion separated longi- 
tudinjJly from a cross section of a tree, which may have been 18 in. or 2 ft. 
in diameter, and from fifty to sixty years of age. At the age of fifty years, 
some person had cut in the bark, and through the liber and alburnum, the 
form of a cross, about a foot long, and had, by some means or other, black- 
ened or oxidised (or probably the weather might have effected this) the 
denuded surface which formed the cross. The tree had been felled about 
ten years afterwards, and happened to be split by the wood-cutter, exactly 
at the layer where the cross was formed ; the fragment now displayed a black 
cross on the wood or interior side, and a corresponding cross on the bark 
side of the section, though the two are three inches apart from each other. 
On counting the layers of wood between the internal and external cross, it 
appears that the former had remained two or three years uncovered, be- 
cause two or three layers are lost there ; but eight between the inner cross 
and the bark are very distinct. In the effort of nature to cover the cross, 
a portion of bark, which had formed the edges of the wound, had been com- 
pletely enclosed and covered with wood, and still remains sound, but not 
lignified. This fragment is not described as being particularly important, 
in a physiological point of view, but still it shows that the accretions to a 
timber tree are added from without, and that bark cannot be changed into 
wood, any more than the skin of an animal can be turned into flesh. There 
is a very complete collection of specimens of timber of all the trees which 
the late Baron Tschoudy knew, and proved would bear the open air in the 
department of the Moselle ; indeed the greater part of the specimens were 
taken by M. Hollandre from trees planted by the Baron ; but we must 
reserve further particulars respecting this museum, and other subjects con- 
nected with Natural History at Metz, till we can seee Professor Hollandre, 
the plantations of the late Baron Tschoudy, and the Natural History Cabi- 
net of M. Meslier de Rocan. 

The Botanic Garden here is small, but not without interest. It was for- 
merly the garden of a convent of Capuchins, whose church now forms a 
very good orangery, and contains 140 large handsome trees, some of them 
20 ft. high, and a Magnolia grandiflora exceeding that height, and finely 
furnished with branches and leaves. This change took place about twenty- 
eight years ago, at which time the present curator, M. Coutie, a native of 
Strasburg, who has been three years in Paris, and six years in England, 



472 Natural History in Foreign Cmmtries, 

and is, consequently, a very superior botanist and gardener, was appointed 
to its management. The hardy herbaceous plants are arranged m beds 
edged with box, according to the natural system, and the hardy ligneous 
plants are also arranged according to that system, at the north end, and 
along piu-t of two sides of the garden, leaving the area open to the south. 
There are none of the specimens of extraordinary magnitude, but some are 
worthy of notice for the progress they have made in twenty-eight years. 
The largest specimens belong, of course, to the genus Populus ; but ^'cer, 
Tilia, JSetulus, Pinus, Platanus, and some other genera, have attained re- 
spectable dimensions. A handsome specimen of Guilandina Bonduc is here ; 
and a T^lia argentea, grafted at the height of 6 ft. upon a common lime 
tree, the diameter of the stock about 1 ft. 6. in., while that of the graft 
projects abruptly, like a capital of a column, nearly l ft. all round, so that 
the diameter of the graft is upwards of 3 ft. ; the head is ovate, about 50 ft. 
high, and 30 ft. in diameter. Other specimens which have grown vigor- 
ously are, Pinus romana, sylvestris, MUgkus (such as we saw in abundance 
in the neighbourhood of Munich), maritima, and Laricio ; Larix americana 
^hus Toxicodendron, and Hippopha'e rhamnoides. The first plant which 
attracted our attention in the stove was Andrtcn Cheriinoliay 1 5 ft. high, in a 
pot not quite a foot in diameter at the surface. It Was raised from seeds, about 
twenty-eight years, ago, and fruited six or eight years ago It produced, in 
two years, nine or ten fruit, about the size, shape, and colour of oranges, and 
very palatable. The seeds were perfect, and yomig plants have been 
raised from them, which are now nearly as large as their parent. There is 
a specimen of Picus bengal^nsis, nearly twenty feet high, with a root pro- 
ceeding from the trunk at the height of twelve feet from the surface of the 
pot. This root, without any assistance from art, has dew^nded to within 
1 ft. 8 in. of the ground ; and the fibre, in its descent, has: in some places 
become monstrous, and expanded into a lamina nearly half an inch broad. 
Having in this state left off growing, the recommencement of growth was 
in the form of small round fibres from the lower extremity of the lamina ; 
these, in their turn, have again become monstrous, and the tongue- 
shaped monstrosities again fringed with fibres, so that the entire tissue of 
roots has rather a singular appearance. Nothing can prove more clearly 
that the fibres of plants, like the leaves and every other accretion, are nou- 
rished by the prepared sap of the plant directed towards them, and not 
immediately by the substances which the roots absorb from the ground, 
water, or air ; just, in short, as an animal is nourished by its blood, and not 
immediately by the food received into its stomach. There is a fine plant 
of Bombax pentaphyllum, 1 5 ft. high, and only ten years old, raised from 
seeds received from Kew. Ehretia /inifolia, Malpighia urens, and Piper re- 
ticulatum, received from the late Mr. Loddiges. Psidium montanum, 1 5 ft. 
high. Sterculia ^jlatanifolia, upwards of 20 ft. high, raised from seeds, 
twenty years ago. In the green-house there is a considerable collection of 
Cape and Australian plants, the greater part received direct from Kew gar- 
dens, either as seeds or small plants. Massonia pustulata. Primula sinensis, 
and fourteen sorts of Chrysanthemum, are the principal plants in flower. M. 
Coutie, though within three weeks of being eighty years of age, is still as 
fond of plants as ever, and showed us some recent arrivals from M. Cels, 
of Paris, which he had received in exchange; a proof, if proof were 
wanting, of the congeniality of botanical and gardening pursuits to age, 
which ought to induce such as are young to take every reasonable op- 
portunity of laying in a stock of ideas on these subjects, for use in that 
period of life. Of the numerous nurseries and gardens in the neighbour- 
hood of the town, and of the pine-apples grown in this garden for the use 
of the Mayor of Metz, we shall have to speak in the Gardener's Magazine.

Besearches on the Pollen of Plants and the ultimate Particles of Matter. — 
The Academy of Sciences, at their Meeting of Dec. 8., heard the report of 
MM. Cassini, Desfontaines, Mirbel, and De Blainville, on a memoir on 
Pollen and the Spermatic Granules of Animals, by M. Adolphe Brongniart. 
In a former memoir on the same subject, this gentleman had detailed some 
interesting and accurately analysed facts ; on the theory contained in it the 
Committee had not given any opinion, but had requested the writer to per- 
severe in his observations. In a subsequent paper, M. Raspail, an experienced 
microscopic observer, had combated the opinions of M. Brongniart, and 
endeavoured to demonstrate that the granules contained in the grains of 
pollen, so far from being analogous to spermatic animalcules, are not even 
organised bodies. After adverting to these memoirs, M. Cassini noticed the 
opinions contained in a paper by the celebrated English botanist, Mr. Robert 
Brown. This gentleman thinks, with M. Brongniart, that the granules of 
pollen are endued with a distinct and independent motion ; but on various 
theoretical points he differs from him. He has not only observed this 
motion in the granules of living plants, but has also perceived the same pro- 
perty in those of plants dried for a century, and preserved in spirits of 
wine, and in those of mosses and equisetums living or dried ; in the mole- 
cules obtained by triturating in water the organic tissue of animals or vege- 
tables living or dead ; and in those obtained in the same manner from all 
sorts of inorganic substances, as glass, granite, &c. In shorty he thinks 
that all the active molecules, organic or inorganic, are the same in nature, 
form, and size, and endued with the same properties ; and not in the least 
different from those observed in pollen by M. Brongniart. 

In the present memoir, which is principally devoted to the refutation of 
M. RaspaiPs objections, M. Brongniart cites, in support of his own mode of 
observation, the curious fact, that plants made to flower in winter, by means 
of shelter and artificial heat, have generally their grains of pollen filled with. 
a mucilaginous substance, devoid of regular and moving granules ; and, as 
these plants rarely fructify, he thence draws an inference favourable to his 
system. 

Thus, then, the question discussed by M. Brongniart is now debated by 
three very skilful observers, and resolved in three different ways : for, whilst 
M. Brongniart admits, in the interior of grains of pollen, regularly organised 
corpuscles, of a very peculiar nature, distinct from all other bodies, analo- 
gous to spermatic animalcules, and essentially destined to produce the 
embryo ; M. Raspail sees nothing in these corpuscles but little resinous 
masses, shapeless, variable, and absolutely deprived of organisation and of 
life ; and Mr. Brown, discarding at once the exclusive opinions of both, 
admits in all natural bodies, whether organic or inorganic, active molecules 
of the same form, size, and nature, and exhibiting a spontaneous motion as 
soon as they are disintegrated and plunged in fluid. 

The Committee, on the one hand, agreed with M. Brongniart and Mr. 
Brown, that the causes to which M. Raspail attributes the motion of the 
granules, exercise, in reality, no influence over them ; and, on the other, 
they coincided with Mr. Brown, that various inorganic bodies, triturated in 
water, offer, if not always, at least sometimes, corpuscles whose size, form, 
and motion are nearly the same, under the microscope, with those of the 
granules of pollen. They also remarked, that the resemblance between the 
active molecules of Mr. Brown and the spermatic granules of M. Brongniart, 
furnishes strong presumptions against the hypothesis of the latter. They 
called the attention of botanists to the singular phenomenon of apparently 
spontaneous motion, and asked if it might not be attributed to mutual 
attraction and repulsion. Great difference was observed in the manifest- 
ations of this phenomenon ; so much so, that, under circumstances to all 
appearance alike, the granules of the same plant at one time exhibited a 
very perceptible motion, and at another perfect immobility.

" Such," said M. Cassini, "are the external appearances. But must we, 
from these, necessarily conclude that the internal nature, and all the pro- 
perties and functions, are absolutely the same, in bodies of so different 
origin ? On this we have not had the temerity to decide ; it can only be 
done after researches much more numerous and profound than we have 
been able to make." {Le Globe, Dec. 13.) 

GERMANY. 

Munich, November 6. — The attachment of the late King of Bavaria, 
Maximilian Joseph, to the pursuit of natural history, was evinced by the 
expedition of Drs. Spix and Martins to examine the natural productions of 
Brazil ; by the botanic garden at Munich, and by the rich collection of 
exotics in the hot-houses at Nymphenburg, in the neighbourhood of that 
capital. The Museum of Natural History is also much indebted to the late 
King, and especially for the Museum Brasilianum, which contains a great 
number of articles, collected by Drs. Spix and Martius. The present king 
does not neglect natural history, and has lately purchased in Holland 
upwards of twenty large specimens of palms, which have been conveyed to 
Nuremburg ; but his attention is chiefly directed to the advancement of 
agriculture and other arts of industry, and to the fine arts. New roads are 
projected i a rail-road (the climate being unfavourable for canals) to join the 
Rhine and the Danube is talked of j an immense building for containing a 
collection of pictures is in progress, and one for a collection of antique 
sculpture nearly completed. Works like these constitute the capital of a 
country, by which its industry is employed to advantage ; and though gal- 
leries of pictures will not return to the nation the same interest on their 
cost, as money laid out on roads, bridges, general drainages, &c., yet in the 
way of attracting strangers, such expenditure will bring something; and, at 
least, more than money laid out in multiplying palaces, which are much less 
interesting to mankind in general, and which cannot, like gardens, mu- 
seums, and collections of objects of art, be enjoyed by every body, and 
afford instruction and entertainment at the same time. 

The Museum of Natural History at Munich may be divided into two 
parts ; the original collection, and that from Brazil. The former is arranged 
according to the Linnean system, and may be considered as extensive. 
Among the Mammalia are good specimens of the rhinoceros, the elephant, 
the reindeer, the elk, and, as an interesting curiosity, the horse of the late 
Count Rumford, on which he is said to have rode out of Munich, to hold 
a conference with the army of Conde, and on which occasion he prevented 
the threat of that army to burn the town from being carried into execution. 
The collection of birds combines also a collection of nests and of eggs. 
The birds a#e placed on sloping stages, enclosed in upright glass cases ; the 
advantage of the slope is that the objects receive the light from the win- 
dows, and reflect it to the eye of the spectator, at a better angle than when 
placed in ranges of shelves rising perpendicularly. Among the insects is an 
excellent collection of exotic butterflies, and the Mollusca and Zoophites 
are numerous. 

The Museum Brasilianum, besides a great many domestic, personal, 
warlike, and regal instruments and ornaments of the Indians, contains large 
specimens of the siren and the dolphin ; a beautiful assemblage of birds; 
a snake above soft, in length; skeletons of Mammalia, including those of 
two alligators ; and a great many specimens of amj)hibious animals, fish, 
shells, and insects. Among the mmerals is a large fragment of meteoric 
stone. Respecting the description of this collection Dr. Martius has pub- 
lished the following 

" JAtcrary Notice. — The sudden death of his fellow-labourer and travel- 
ling companion has given occasion to Dr. Martius to notify to amateurs.

and to the subscribers to the literary undertaking relative to his voyage to 
the Brazil with the deceased, that the description of that voyage will be 
continued, the King having communicated to him the papers of the late Dr. 
Spix. The greater part of the second volume, and of the atlas, is already 
printed. It being impossible to comprise every thing in this second volume, 
a third, without an atlas, will by necessity be published, which will contain 
the voyage on the river Amazon, and some geographical, statistical, and 
physical details. Dr. Martius will study to keep the work within mode- 
rate limits, so that it may be sold at a reasonable price ; the atlas will con- 
tain twenty sheets, instead of fifteen, as originally announced, with views, 
portraits, &c., a second sheet of the general map of South America, and 
several subordinate maps. 

" The botanical works will also be continued on same principle. The 
genera and species of palms will be finished with the delivery of the fifth 
part, and the Nova Genera Plantarum will be completed by a third volume, 
which will contain a very curious monograph of Cryptogamia, half of 
which, on twenty-five plates, is already finished. 

" 'i he description and figures of the the fishes of Brazil, which death 
prevented Dr. Spix from completing, will be published by Dr. Martius, who 
hopes to effect all these objects with respect to Brazil in the course of two 
or three years, and in this manner to give an idea of the riches, in natural 
history, of a country which, in every respect, merits the attention and the 
interest of Europe.

Dr. Martius is at present occupied with an original and ingenious 
theory of the structure of plants ; the Doctor gave" some account of it a 
few weeks ago at Berlin, wliere it excited a great sensation ; it will very 
soon be published in a German periodical, and we are promised a copy on 
its first appearance, for the purpose of translating and laying before our 
readers. In the mean time we put down one or two ideas recollected from 
a general outline of the theory which the Doctor stated to us. The knot, 
or joint, of plants with stems, or the collar of plants without stems, con- 
tains the life, and is for all the purposes of reproduction as perfect as the 
seed. The leaves of plants are protruded from the stem in the order of 
circumvolving lines ; the fifth or the sixth leaf will always be found over 
the first, and no plant can produce a flower till the leaves have made at 
least one circumvolution. The flower and all its parts are but modifications 
of the leaf; and the calyx, the corolla, and the stamens follow the same law 
in their developement as the leaves. The whole of that part of the plant 
which is above ground, may be described as a travelling leaf. Supposing 
this theory to be supported by facts, the uses to be derived from it, in vege- 

K K 2 



4i76" Natural History in Foreign Countries, 

table culture and scientific description, are various and important. In the 
first place, an end will be put to the doubts respecting the comparative 
durability of plants propagated by extension, and those propagated by seeds. 
In the second place, from details which we cannot fully enter into, the de- 
scriptions of natural orders and genera may be reduced to short definitions, 
and the employment of signs, somewhat in the manner of algebra, be 
adopted, instead of long descriptions. Dr. Martins showed us a proof- 
sheet, in which a number of natural orders, beginning with iZanunculaceae, 
•were defined in less than two lines each, and some in only one line, by signs 
and numerals. We shall not follow these very remarkable views further, 
lest we should fall into error, and because we hope, in our next Number, 
to give them in more detail. 

It is possible that, as the study of natural science advances, the language 
of scientific description may be greatly simplified and abridged. This has 
already been done by Linnaeus, and may be carried still farther by such in- 
ventions as that of which we have endeavoured to give an idea. It is more 
easy to conceive this, than it is to conceive with what facility, and in how 
short a time, a knowledge of all the objects of natural history may ulti- 
mately be acquired ; and that whidi is at present considered learning and 
science, and confined to a few specially devoted to it, may at length be 
universally possessed in every civilised country, and in every rank of life. 
To have speculated, two centuries ago, on the probability of all the inha- 
bitants of a country being able to read, write, and count, as they now are 
in Bavaria and Wurtemberg, would not have been thought more preposte- 
rous than to assert, at the present day, the practicability and probability of 
mechanics, chemistry, and natural history being, two centuries hence, com- 
mon acquirements of the country labourers of Europe. 

Ratisbon, Nov. 10. — There are a Botanical Society here and a small 
Botanic Garden. A periodical, exclusively devoted to botany, The Bo- 
tanische Zeitung^ has been published at Ratisbon since 1801. Its projector 
and first editor was Dr. Hoppe, the president of the Society; and its present 
editor is his pupil. Dr. Eischweiler, who has lately commenced another 
periodical, in like manner exclusively devoted to botany, entitled Literatur 
blinker fur reine und angew-andte Botatiick, &c. The Doctor is of opinion, 
that there ought to be a periodical exclusively devoted to every separate 
division of natural history and literature ; for he finds, in the present state 
of things, in which one journal embraces so many objects, that he cannot 
discover every thing which is published respecting botany, though he devotes 
himself entirely and exclusively to that science, and has access to all or most 
of the periodical publications of Europe. The Bulletin des Sciences Natu- 
relles of Baron Ferussac, which he acknowledges to be the most complete 
thing of the kind in existence, he says, does not contain notices of the half 
of what is pubhshed in Germany on natural history ; and his own journal, 
he doubts not, is likely to be deficient, both in respect to England and 
America. The truth is, that ninety-nine hundredths of what is published 
in the world of literature is mere repetition, in one country or language, 
of what has been published in another, or known long before. What is 
really new is like a grain of wheat in a bushel of chaff. At all events, we 
are certain of this with respect to agriculture and gardening, in which there 
has been very little novelty since the time of the Romans, who, on their 
part, seem to have added nothing to what was known to the Greeks. With 
the progress of things, it is probable that the literary men of every country 
may finally arrange themselves in one grand republic; and that all which is 
already known and worth becoming acquainted with, in each particular 
department of science and literature, being fixed in one elementary and 
fundamental work, a committee of the whole world, for each particular 
department or subdivision, may be employed to record the increments 
which are added to each as they arc discovered. There will then be such 



Natural History in Foreign Countries, 477 

periodicals as Dr. Eischweiler would approve of. In the mean time, it must 
not be forgotten, that the nearest approximation to such a state of things 
has been made by the Baron F^russac, in his system of Bulletins Universals 
dcs Sciences el des Arts^ a work which, it is to be hoped, will meet with 
such encouragement as to enable its conductor to render it as perfect as the 
present state of things admits of. 

Nuremberg, Nov. 12. — There is neither botanic garden nor public col- 
lection of natural history here; but there is a lady, Madame de Hepp, who 
is one of the greatest botanical amateurs in Germany. Her collection of 
hot-house and green-house plants is the most extensive which we have seen 
in Bavaria, next to those of the government at Munich, and of the king 
at Nymphenburg. This lady makes an extensive journey almost every 
year, to see what is new or rare in Holland, France, Prussia, and Austria; 
and no price deters her from purchasing what she considers desirable. She 
has also an aviary with a variety of birds. The garden of Madame de Hepp 
is close to the town, beautifully laid out, and highly kept ; but of this we 
shall speak elsewhere, though we cannot help adding, that we have seldom 
been more delighted than when we were conducted through it by this 
charming woman. 

Stuttgardy Nov. 21. — There was formerly a very considerable menagery 
here, the private property of the late king : but it was given up on the pre- 
sent king's accession to the throne; some say, as being too expensive to 
support ; and others, because the king is so great a lover of liberty, that he 
cannot bear to see any animal in confinement, not even birds in cages. The 
inhabitants of the menagery were poisoned by prussic acid, and stuffed for 
the Cabinet of Natural History ; where they may now be seen, bearing, with 
other objects there, evidence that this institution also is found rather ex- 
pensive to keep in order. It deserves to be noticed, that the academy of 
Stuttgard, celebrated about thirty years ago, and in which were educated 
several great men from every part of Europe, many of them now living, no 
longer exists, and for the same reason. The building is now occupied by 
the king's private library; and the grounds, for every pupil of the academy 
had a small garden for his recreation, have been levelled, and formed into 
an English garden, in front of what is called the New Palace. The truth, 
probably, is, that poor kings, like other poor men, are generally blessed with 
large families ; like other poor men, they, too, feel it necessary to economise ; 
and collections of natural history, being luxuries, are dispensed with, in 
order to build palaces, and lay out gardens, for the rising generation of 
princes. This evil, however (which, it must be observed, neither applies to 
Wurtemberg nor Bavaria), like other evils, will, in time, work its own cure; 
and what was proposed to be brought about in some of the German states, 
in the beginning of the present century, and rejected at the time, will, pro- 
bably, before the century is completed, be adopted as the result of public 
opinion throughout Europe, and as matter of necessity. 

The Museum of Natural History is placed in a very suitable building, 
and, compared with the collections at Strasburg and Munich, is respect- 
able. In every department there are species of most of the Linnean genera ; 
and, in the class of birds, there are several hundreds, not yet mounted, 
which have been sent from the Cape of Good Hope by Ludwig, a native of 
Wurtemberg, resident at the Cape, and a great lover and promoter of natu- 
ral history. A considerable proportion of the articles are neither arranged 
nor named; some of those which have names do not present the labels to 
advantage ; and the cases, in respect of Hght and the convenience of the 
spectator, are not either so favourably designed or placed as in the museums 
of Strasburg and Munich. These defects are not the result of any want 
of skill or anxiety on the part of the naturalists who are connected with 
the establishment. Professors Jager and Bopp, but arc evidently unavoid- 
able, for want of funds. The most remarkable objects, and, happily, those 

K K 3 



478 Natural Histoj-y in Foreign Countries, 

•^hich. require least expense for tlicir preservation, are, specimens of the 
mineral products of Norway, Iceland, and Siberia; a collection of fossil 
bones of the mammoth, elephant, stag, horse, and other animals, dug up at 
Canstadt, near Stuttgard, which are frequently referred to by Cuvier (who 
was educated at the academy here), Buckland, and other authors. There is 
also a collection of specimens of native marble, of which the most remark- 
able variety is that of Bottingen, which, being formed of an agglomeration 
of stalactites, when sawn up longitudinally, presents the appearance of pur- 
ple stripes passing into white, and, of course, transversely, of concentric 
circles similarly coloured. As an appendix to this museum, there are a 
number of curious pictures, books, relics, and other articles, selected from 
the suppressed convent, among which is a portrait of the Countess of Salz- 
burg, who, at the age of fifty years, had mustachios, whiskers, and a beard, 
as long and black as those of any man. 

The Botanic Garden here contains a tolerable collection ; the herbaceous 
plants are arranged according to the Linnean system ; and the trees and 
shrubs grouped in masses, after the natural orders of Jussieu. To zoology 
and botany, however, Wurtemberg has contributed less than to geology, the 
fossil remains of this part of Germany being highly interesting. On this 
subject we are promised communications, from time to time, by the corre- 
spondent whom we have had the good fortune to establish here. 

Heidelberg, Nov. 25. — A Museum of Natural History was commenced 
here in 1821, and has already made considerable progress. The collection 
of birds is very considerable: they are arranged in glass cases along the 
sides of a narrow gallery, and each subject has a label of green paper pasted 
on the glass, with the name printed, according to Linnaeus, Cuvier, or such 
other modern naturalist as may have proposed a nomenclature which has 
been received in the scientific world, in French and in German. As good 
specimens in excellent preservation, were pointed out to us, Fultur fuscus, 
Falco Albicilla ; Gapeatus barbatus, young and full grown ; O^tis tarda, 
Tringa pugnax, Vanellus melanogaster, Turdus roseus, Rhynchops nigra, 
and a number of others, which we had not time to note down. The other 
divisions of zoology are not yet so rich ; but there are a great many 
specimens of reptiles and amphibia, and a good many insects ; each insect 
fixed in a small case, with a glass bottom and top, which admits of viewing 
it minutely and completely on both sides, and without derangement. Every 
day this collection is receiving accessions from different quarters. Much 
taste and spirit are shown by those who have commenced it and are promot- 
ing its progress ; and the curator, who shows it to the public, is a man who 
takes the greatest pains to excite an interest in the spectator, by pointing 
out the more interesting specimens, and accompanying his indications with 
short historical details. 

There are two Botanic Gardens here : one adjoining the museum, chiefly 
for the sake of the medical students, and containing a collection of her- 
baceous plants, arranged according to the Linnean system ; the other on 
the eminence on which stand the ruins of the castle of Heidelberg, con- 
taining a collection of hardy trees and shrubs for the students of forest 
culture (forstwissenschaft), and also a collection of agricultural plants for 
the students of agriculture (ackerbau). Forest culture is a subject of great 
importance in densely peoj)led countries, where wood serves not only for 
the purpose of architectural construction, but is the only fuel. The garden 
round the castle is well known and justly celebrated for its picturesque beau- 
ties, its antiquities, and its views of the town and the valley of the Neckar. 
The agricultural garden contains one of the most extensive collections of 
CerelSilia cultivated in Europe, unless we except that of M. Lagnsca, as far 
as respects the genus Triticum. 'J'he director of these gardens, M. Metz- 
ger, has written Europacische Ccrealicn in Botanischer und Landmrlhschajl- 
licker Himicht, &c., Heidelberg, 1824, folio, 20 plates; a work of which we 



Natural History in Foreign Countries, 479 

have already given a short account in the Garde7ier*s Magazine, and which, 
on our returnto England, we hope to make better known. In the mean 
time we may state that M. Metzger cultivates, yearly, a bed, about 50 ft. 
long and 4 ft. broad, of each of the marked varieties of Cerealia grown 
in Europe, of which he willingly distributes the seeds to all who will 
make a good use of them. We declined accepting of a collection which 
he offered us till we could find an East Lothian farmer, or some nobleman 
like the late Duke of Bedford, who would undertake to cultivate them, and 
persevere in their culture, till their comparative value, with respect to 
Britain, be ascertained. M. Metzger is a learned and scientific gardener of 
great ingenuity ; he lives in a habitable fragment of the ruins of the castle, 
has a considerable Hbrary of gardening and topography, and a good herba- 
rium. He keeps an assistant and an engraver, and is occupied in preparing, 
among other works, A Description of the ancient and present State of the 
Castle and Gardens of Heidelberg, in which some very curious information 
will be given from two very rare works ; the one describing the ceremonies 
which took place on the arrival at Heidelberg of Elizabeth, daughter of 
James the First of England ; and the other Hortus Falatinus a Heidelbei'gcB 
extructiis, S. de Cans Architecto, 1620, in folio, with many plates. M. Metz- 
ger has also, in his own room, by a very simple process, which he has 
described to us, prepared paper, resembling that of the Chinese, from the 
bark of ilforus papyrifera ; and a still more perfect paper, peculiarly 
adapted for taking tracings of drawings, from the roots of ^Ithge^a officinalis. 
Both processes we shall elsewhere describe. 

The grounds adjoining the castle occupy several acres, and are laid out 
with winding walks in the natural style. The trees and shrubs are not 
arranged according to any system, because the collection has been assem- 
bling for several years ; but each genus is kept by itself, and the individuals 
are disposed on the turf in natural or picturesque groups. Every spe- 
cies and variety has placed by it a tin label on an iron rod, on which is 
written the Linnean name and synonymes, the German name, the natural 
order (?), and the native country. Close to the building, and also within 
its ruined walls, it is in contemplation to have collections of alpine and 
other herbaceous plants, and small American shrubs. These gardens are 
open to every body, and constitute one of the principal promenades of 
Heidelberg. There are not many instances in which the grounds of ruined 
castles, or what may be called the feudal wastes of ancient cities, are 
arranged in so instructive and agreeable a manner; and we should like to 
gee something of the kind imitated here and there in Britain, for instance, 
at Ludlow, Stirling, &c. 

The museum and clinical botanic garden occupy what was formerly a 
monastery and its burying ground; a change of destination not less bene- 
ficial to society. 

At Schwetzingen, in the post-house, we witnessed, for the first time, what 
we have since seen frequently, an amusing application of zoological know- 
ledge, for the purpose of prognosticating the weather. Two frogs, of the 
species jRana arborea, are kept in a crystal jar, about 18 in. high and 6 in. 
in diameter, with a depth of three or four inches of water at the bottom, 
and a small ladder reaching to the top of the jar. On the approach of dry 
weather, the frogs mount the ladder; but, when moisture is expected, they 
descend into the water. These animals are of a bright green, and in their 
wild state here climb the trees in search of insects, and make a peculiar 
singing noise before rain. In the jar they get no other food than now and 
then a fly ; one of which, we were assured, would serve a frog for a week, 
though it will eat from six to twelve in a day if it can get them. In catch- 
ing the flies put alive into the jar the frogs display great adroitness. In the 
gardens and hot-houses of Schwetzingen are extensive collections of plants, 
but nothing in the way of zoology or mineralogy worthy of remark. 

K K 4 



480 Natural History in Foreign Countries, 

Carlsrvhcy Nov. 30. — In the Museum here there is the best collection of 
shells which we have seen out of Paris, in excellent preservation, but, un- 
happily for the visitor, not named. A number of the specimens are very 
striking, from their size or singularity of form ; and of some of the rarest, 
as of the Geometrical Stair (?), there are duplicates and triplicates. The 
collection was made by degrees, at the expense of the late Marchioness 
Caroline Louisa, known to botanists by the genus of exotic trees Carolinea. 
Of the C. princeps there is a dried specimen, framed and glazed, suspended 
in the museum. The collection of Mammalia and other zoological sub- 
jects is limited, but still respectable, though not in remarkably good order, 
and none of the species named. Among the curiosities is a fibrous or fox- 
tail root of Pdpulus italica, the thickest part of which does not exceed one 
fourth of an inch, while its length is 24 ft. A small root had found its way 
into a wooden pipe which conveyed water to a fountain, and gradually 
increased in length and in number of fibres, lessening, of course, the quan- 
tity of water delivered, till at last the current was entirely stopped, when, 
the pipe being taken up, the root was removed. 

Tne collection of minerals is rich. Besides the granites, marbles, ores, 
stalactites, petrifactions, crystallisations, salts, agates, and other rare stones 
of the country, there is a collection of Siberian minerals, presented by the 
late Emperor of Russia, containing emeralds estimated to be worth 14,000 
florins ; a mass of rock crystal, 2 ft. square by 18 in. deep, for which, accord- 
ing to the guide, two Englishmen offered 20,000 florins ; a number of large 
masses and beautifully formed specimens of rock crystal, from St. Gothard; 
a piece of the trunk of a petrified beech tree, 2\ ft. in diameter and 5 ft. 
long; bones of the head and legs of a mammoth,' the head of a rhinoceros • 
a great number of impressions of fishes, plants, leaves, &c. The apartment 
in which these articles are exhibited is too small, and it is also badly lighted ; 
still the collection is very interesting, and we cannot but regret that it is not 
placed in a suitable building, with all the ai'ticles conspicuously named, and 
a careful and skilful attendant appointed to keep the whole in proper 
order. We think it would contribute to the instruction and enjoyment of 
the public who visit such museums, and especially of country people who 
have not much leisure for reading or the culture of their minds, if a pro- 
fessor or professors were appointed to show and describe the articles, and 
even if the professors were to accompany their indicative remarks by others 
of a scientific, philosophical, moral, or theological character, according to 
the apparent wants and wishes of the visitor. It would not cost the three 
governments of Baden, Wurtemberg, and Bavaria, for each professor of 
this description, more than what it now costs them for each couple of game- 
keepers. Gmelin, the professor of botany here, is said to be occupied 
in preparing a catalogue of this museum ; but, as he was at this time absent, 
we had not an opportunity of ascertaining what progress he had made. 

There was formerly an interesting menagery in the grand-ducal garden 
here, kept up at the expense of the same munificent princess, who devoted, 
as we were told, her pin-money to the formation of the collection of shells 
in the museum, already mentioned ; but, at her death, the menagery was 
sold, and, as at Stuttgard, the skins of some of the animals are now in the 
museum. 

The Grand-Ducal Botanic Garden is known, by the Horius Carlsmhunus^ 
to contain one of the first collections of exotics in Germany, diamse'rops 
humilis ripens perfect fruit here every year, the plant bearing both male 
and female flowers. Wistaria Consequa«« (Glycine sinensis) appears to 
have been introduced here long before it was known in Britain, there being 
a large plant against the end of a green-house, which has been there for 
upwards of fifteen years, under the name of Glycine arborca : it is as iiardy 
as Glycine frut<?scens, flowers profusely, and ripens seeds, from which young 
plants have been raised. American trees and shrubs thrive remarkably 



Natttral Histoi-y in Foi'eign Countries, 481 

well ; they are not planted in peat earth, as in England, but in rotten 
wood, mixed with common garden soil. Andromeda arborea has attained 
the size of a tree, and ripens seeds every year ; Dlrca palustris is large, and 
has also perfected seeds, from which plants have been raised. Many other 
interesting particulars we omit, as belonging rather to gardening than 
natural history : but we must notice a very extensive collection of seeds, 
perhaps 1 000 species, in small flat crystal bottles, conspicuously arranged 
and named ; and a collection of woods, indigenous and exotic, perhaps 
100 species, each specimen in the form of a book, lettered on the back, and 
placed in a bookcase. In the green-house of this garden, as in that of the 
botanic garden of Heidelberg, plants of Vallisnerifl spiralis, male and female, 
are kept for the purpose of illustrating the sexual system. 

In the centre of the principal green-house there is a fountain, and over 
it a large wire cage, containing a collection of hardy singing birds, which, 
when those parts of the windows that are opened for air are covered with 
wire netting, are allowed to fly about the house ; but as they are only fed 
in the cage, or rather wire tent, they always return to it, and are easily re- 
enclosed. In the bark bed of the stove, M. Harsweg, who is a great lover 
of insects, inserts the eggs of ^Scarabae'us nasicornis Lin., a singular-looking 
beetle, in the beginning of February : the perfect insects appear in the 
course of the summer, and in the evening fly about the garden, and add to 
the variety of twilight sounds and insect forms. The eggs, unlike those of 
the common cockchaffer, which require upwards of a year to become per- 
fect insects, are perfected in the course of three or four months. He has 
not found that this beetle does harm to any thing, though he has found the 
common Rose Cockchaffer, in its winged state, attack and eat ripe pine- 
apples. He also observed that the S. nasicorn's, or the Horned Cock- 
chaffer, frequently deposited its eggs in soft earth and rotten dung in the 
open air, but that they were always destroyed by the winter frost ; so that 
there is no danger of their being naturalised in Germany. Those who wish 
to try this experiment, may procure the eggs, as well as those of a number 
of other curious insects, from, or through, M. Cels, nurseryman, Mont- 
rouge, Paris. 

Koelreuter (known to botanists by his name-plant, Koelreuterirt panicu- 
lata), who was formerly professor of botany here, is said to have made a 
great many observations on the pollen of plants. The Chevalier Zeyer, the 
garden-director of Schwetzingen, a scientific and ardent botanist, who has 
formed and collected a herbarium of upwards of 20,000 species, informs 
us that he has seen drawings, by Koelreuter, of the magnified particles bf 
pollen, of upwards of 2000 genera ; that Professor Koelreuter considered 
that every genus that was truly distinct had a distinct form of pollen, and 
that the magnified figures of the ultimate particles of pollen would probably 
be found the most definite of all generic distinctions. The drawings are in 
the hands of his son, a physician here, who, it is regretted by M. Zeyer, 
does not communicate them to the public, or state his reasons for with- 
holding them. 

We have brought away from Carlsruhe one live JKana arborea, not being 
able to procure a second or third individual ; plants of Vallisneria, a genus 
which, we believe, is not yet introduced into England; and, as souvenirs. 
Wistaria Consequawa, Andromeda arborea, and Dirca palustris, raised from 
seeds ripened at Carlsruhe. We hope we shall be more successful with Val- 
lisneria than we were with Salvlnia natans in 1819, which we succeeded in 
bringing from Lago Oscuro to Paris, but lost there, by placing it, floating 
in a vessel of water, on the outside of our chamber window, whence it could 
only be taken by sparrows or swallows. The grief and pain of disappoint- 
ment that we experienced on this occasion, can only be understood by those 
who have had a similar trial, or who know, from reasoning and reflection,

the value which care and labour give to any thing; in short, who can apply 
the theory of the value of labour metaphysically as well as physically. 

Man in the South of Germany. — It cannot be altogether foreign to 
natural history, to notice the influence of climate, food, and political and 
religious regulations on the human species ; and wc are unwilling to leave 
Germany without saying something on so interesting a people as the Ger- 
mans. It will not be denied that man is subject to the same laws as other 
animals, and that his natural or inborn character must depend principally 
on the climate and products of the soil where he is placed. His factitious, 
or civilised, character will as certainly depend on his education, taking that 
word in its most extensive sense, as including parental care and example, 
scholastic tuition, religion, and government. In warm fertile countries, 
where nature produces every thing spontaneously, man becomes inactive, 
and has naturally few labours and few enjoyments. In extremely cold and 
inhospitable climates, the enjoyments of man are also few, because the 
labour necessary to overcome natural objects is too great for his powers. 
Jt would seem, therefore, that intermediate climates are more favourable 
for human happiness than either extremes ; but whether such as are at all 
times temperate, as those of many parts of Italy and Spain, or such as 
are alternately temperate and severe, as those of the south of Germany and 
the north of France, are the best, may perhaps be doubted. It appears that 
a climate where the winters are severe, has a considerable influence on the 
human character, by the necessity which it induces of forethought, in the 
laying up a provision of food for winter, and the greater attention and 
labour that are requisite in the article of clothing for that season. It is 
certain, on the other hand, that, in climates at all times temperate, the 
health, other circumstances being alike, must be better than in severe cli- 
mates, where it is impaired by the artificial atmosphere of apartments during 
the winter season ; and constant good health must necessarily have a con- 
siderable influence on the character. Supposing, therefore, all the artificial 
circumstances to be the same in two climates, such as that of the south of 
Germany, and that of Italy or the central parts of France, it seems reason- 
able to conclude that man would attain to a higher degree of perfection 
in the latter climates than in the former. So much for our theory of the 
influence of soil and climate on man ; and, for further details, we refer the 
reader to Dr. Falconar's work on the subject (Bath, 4to, 1788 ?). 

Of all the artificial or accidental circumstances which influence the cha- 
racter, personal education must be allowed to be the greatest, and, next, 
religion and government. Manner of life, occupations, and pursuits, and 
even amusements, have an important influence. To do more than premise 
these matters, would be unsuitable to this Magazine ; but what has been 
said became necessary as an introduction to what is to follow. 

Applying the above theory to the three states of Germany which we have 
passed through, Wurtemberg, Bavaria, and Baden, the climate and soil of 
these states seem favourable in the second degree; education, to a certain 
extent, is there universal ; religion is, on the whole, more simple than in 
some other countries ; and the laws and governments seem, at least, equal, 
in constitutional merits and impartial administration, to those of any people 
in Europe. The manner of life, or occupation, is chiefly agricultural ; which, 
though not favourable to luxury and refinement, seems, without doubt, for 
the great mass of the people, the happiest mode of existence. Local and 
personal attachments are universally telt to be essential sources of happi- 
ness ; and in no way can this feeling be gratified so easily anil eflectually as 
by the possession of land. In the three countries named, the great majority 
of the population are occupiers in perpetuity, of a portion of the soil, 
either as absolute proprietors or as perpetual renters. This state of things 
is far from being favourable to what is called making money ; but it is highly 
favourable to health and contentment. It is a groat deal for a poor man to 



Natural Hhtoi-y in Foreign Countries, 483 

have something which he can call his own ; something on which he can 
bestow labour, and from which he can-, in consequence, extract enjoyment. 
The absolute necessities of life are few, and derived directly from the soil; 
the labouring man, therefore, M'ho has a house and a few roods of land, is 
certain of a b.ome and food ; he increases the interest of his home by a wife ; 
and parental care and solicitude, with connubial and filial attachment, fill 
up the measure of his happiness. These are the Cissential purposes and 
enjoyments of life, which nature intended for all men; which the poor man 
can enjoy as well as the rich ; and for which no other enjoyment, either of 
the rich or the poor, the wise or the learned, can entirely compensate. In 
no part of Europe have we seen, or thought we have seen, these enjoyments 
so generally diffused as in the countries we have recently passed through, 
and more especially Wurtembcrg. We entered on these countries, expect- 
ing to find the people not much better off than in France ; but we could 
not resist the conviction, produced by constant observation, and the result 
of various enquiry, that comfort and happiness exist to a much greater de- 
gree among the labouring classes of society in the south of Germany, than 
they do in Britain. The people, at first sight, have a milder and more 
c'vilised aspect. The dress of the country labourers, male and female, does 
not consist of such fine materials as in England ; but one part of the dress 
is of a quality consistent with the others, and the whole is in a superior 
style, compared with the dress of the other classes of society. There is no 
such thing, in this part of Germany, as a man or woman in rags, or with a 
coat or gown of the best quality, and the hat or stockings in tatters, as is 
frequently the case, not only among labourers, but even among niechanics, 
in England. In short, the dress in Germany is in much better keeping. 
Both men and women of the labouring class here are more intelligent in 
their aspect, much more civil and polite on a first acquaintance, and much 
better furnished with conversation, than the British labourers. What struck 
us particularly were, the great rarity of exceptions to this general descrip- 
tion, the general uniformity of manner and character throughout the whole 
country, and the total absence of public beggars. On enquiry, we found 
that there were ?e\w or no poor supported publicly, though every parish is 
obliged to support its poor when unable to work ; and, also, that there were 
very few people in prison, either for debt or for crime of any kind. 

This state of things more particularly applies to Wurtemberg ; and the 
causes, we think, may be very easily traced. The first and principal cause 
is a law respecting schools, which has existed, more or less, in the states of 
the south of Germany, for above a centnr}^ but which has been greatly im- 
proved within the last thirty years. By this law, parents are compelled to 
send their children to school, from the age of six to fourteen years, where 
they must be taught reading, writing, and arithmetic, but where they may 
acquire as much additional instruction in other branches as their parents 
choose to pay for. To many of the schools of Bavaria large gardens are 
attached, in which the boys are taught the principal operations of agriculture 
and gardening in their hours of play ; and, in all the schools of the three 
states, the girls, in addition to the same instruction as the boys, are taught 
knitting, sewing, embroidery, &c. It is the duty of the police and priest 
(which may be considered equivalent to our parish vestries) of each com- 
mune or parish, to see that the law is duly executed, the children sent re- 
gularly, and instructed duly. If the parents are partially or wholly unable 
to pay for their children, the commune makes up the deficiency. Religion 
is taught by the priest of the village or hamlet ; and where, as is frequently 
the case in Wurtemberg, there are two or three religions in one parish, 
each child is taught by the priest of its parents; all of which priests are, 
from their ofhce, members of the committee or vestry of the commune. 
The priest or priests of the parish have the regular inspection of the school- 
master, and are required by the government to see that he does his duty. 



484 Natural History in Foreign Countries. 

while each priest, at the same time, sees that the children of his flock attend 
regularly. After the child has been the appointed number of years at 
school, it receives from the schoolmaster, and the priest of the religion to 
which it belongs, a certificate, without which it cannot procure employment. 
To employ any person under twenty-one, without such a certificate, is ille- 
gal, and punished by a fixed fine, as is almost every other offence in this 
pai't of Germany ; and the fines are never remitted, which makes punish- 
ment always certain. The schoolmaster is paid much in the same way as in 
Scotland ; by a house, a garden, and sometimes a field, and by a small salary 
from the parish j and by fixed rates for the children. 

A second law, which is coeval with the school. law, renders it illegal for 
any young man to marry before he is twenty-five, or any young woman be- 
ibre she is eighteen ; and a young man, at whatever age he wishes to marry, 
must show, to the police and the priest of the commune where he resides, 
that he is able, and has the prospect, to provide for a wife and family. 

There are minor causes, but these two laws, and the general possession of 
land both by labourers and tradesmen, are the chief. Amongst the minor 
causes are the general simplicity of their forms of religion, and universal 
toleration ; even the Catholic faith, in Wurtemberg, is unattended with the 
ceremony and spectacle with which it is exhibited in various parts of Ger- 
many and France. The equal footing on which the different religions are 
placed, is also favourable to liberality of sentiment and good neighbourhood. 
That particular mildness of feature and character, so different from what is 
met with in the labouring classes in England, is, no doubt, partly owing to 
the greater proportions of vegetables and fruits which enter into the general 
diet of the population ; the almost total abstinence from strong liquors or 
spirits, the general drink being wine ; and, perhaps, to the almost unremitted 
smoking of tobacco from morning to night. 

If we seem to have wandered a little from our direct path, in order to 
bring these particulars into the view of our readers, it is because we think 
similar laws, in respect to education and marriage, would be of the greatest 
importance to Britain and Ireland. Nothing could be easier than for every 
vestry and parish clergyman to see them executed. Such laws would be a 
small infringement, it is true, on personal liberty ; but an infringement 
which, we should think, every reasonable parent would assent to, and for 
which, we are sure, every child, on its arrival at the age of maturity, would 
be thankful. We most ardently wish that the state of things in the three 
countries mentioned, might attract the attention of some person of parlia- 
mentary interest; and that those who have doubts on the subject, would 
consent to inform themselves by a residence of a few weeks in Wurtemberg, 
and especially at Stuttgard, round which city will be found one of the richest 
and most picturesque countries in Europe. If we have made any mis- 
takes in this hurrie(l relation, written without leisure to refer to the docu- 
ments which we have in our portmanteau, M. Zoller, one of the Commis- 
sioners of National Schools, and our principal informant, will correct us, or 
supply our omissions. — Cond.

Flora Vtrgiiiatia. — Sprengel of Halle, and Martin of London, have en- 
deavoured to ascertain the identity of the plants mentioned by Virgil; and, 
more recently, M. Fee of Paris, was employed upon the same subject by the 
editor of the Latin Classics; but Sig. Tenore of Naples, has not only had the 
advantage of their remarks, but has travelled over Italy with his rirgUin his 
hand, and has just published the result in a brochure entitled Osscrvazioni 
$uUa Flora Virgiliana. He only mentions -eleven. 1. The Jrundo of 
¦Virgil is not necessarily the ^rundo Donax, nor the A. Phragmitcs, as M. 
F^e decides ; for Italy possesses other species of ^rundo. 2. The i/accar 
is not the Valcrihna celtica, as M. F<:e think?, but rather the j'sarum. 3. The

Cerlnthe must be either the ^^atur^ja Thymbra, or S. capitata. 4. The Cu- 
cumis of the line

is not the common cucumber, but the Ciicumis Chate of Linnaius, a plant 
originally brought from Egypt, by the conquerors of the world. As to the 
Cucumis' caeruleus of Virgil, Sig. Tenore thinks it must be the Melonc ver^ 
nico of the Italians. 5. The ^''sculus is, without doubt, the Qu^rcus J?obur 
var. latifolia, and not the Qudrcus JS'sculus, of which the existence in the 
Flora of Virgil is doubtful. 6. The ^^dera dlba is not the Antirrhinum 
Asarina, a common plant in the South of France, but which is not found ir> 
the Neapolitan territory. It must be that variety of if^dera called by Pliny 
Chrysocarpum. 7. The ^yacinthus is not the I/llium Mdrtagon. It accord* 
better with Gladiolus byzantinus. 8. The Oleaster is not the JSleagnus an- 
gustifolia, or Bohemian olive, which never grew spontaneously in Italy, but 
the wild olive at present known all over the south of Italy by the name of 
Olivastro, 9. The Cerca prima belong to the variety named by the Italians 
Scaldatelle. 10. The i^oseta is the cultivated rose. 11. The riburnum is 
not the Lantana, but the Fiburnum Tinus. {Bulletin des Sciences.)

Erratic Boulders and Blocks. — The huge blocks of granite and other 
primary rocks, which are found scattered over plains and ravines at a great 
"distance from any rocks of the same species, whence they could have been 
detached, have long been a subject of interesting study and speculation to 
geologists ; and numerous facts connected with their phenomena may be 
found in the papers of De Luc, Saussure, Von Buch, Hausmann, and Sedge- 
wick, of which a brief summary, along with some original facts, may be found 
in the Conversations on Geology, p. 237. To these facts we have to add an ex- 
cellent paper, by M. Brongniart, in the Annales des Sciences Naturelles for 
May, on the rock blocks of Sweden. The author agrees with Hausmann and 
Yon Buch, in tracing the erratic blocks which are scattered over the plains of 
Seeland, Holstein, and the southern shores of the Baltic, to the table lands 
(plateaux) of Scandinavia. Their size is frequently enormous, and they abound 
in the sandy plains of Holstein, still more in that of Seeland, and in the vici- 
nity of Copenhagen, even to Elsineur. They furnish, indeed, the only building 
itones in those districts. It was at first supposed that they must have come 
from the Hartz mountains, the nearest district of granite in situ, but more 
minute inspection proved their identity with the rocks of Sweden, particu- 
larly in the minerals contained in them such as wernerite, and in the cal- 
careous blocks, trilobites, and orthoceratites, as M. Brongniart proved. The 
greatest difficulty of explaining the transit of these blocks is the Sound, 
which, though narrow, is very deep ; and it does not appear in what man- 
ner they could have cleared it, as they continue to be found in Scania the 
same as in Seeland. A similar difficulty is presented by the deep valley of 
the Aar, with respect to the blocks of Mount Jura. They are so abundant 
in some places, as to form a sort of hill, which the Swedes call ose,ov sand- 
osar, according to the predominance of blocks or of sand. These M. Bron- 
gniart found more particularly in Scania, Smoland, Sundermania, and Up- 
land. They are seldom high, and usually long and narrow in form, being 
rather larger, and more elevated at one extremity than another, and some- 
times interrupted towards the middle with a tranverse ravine. They main- 
tain a constant direction from N.N.E. to S.S.W., extending to considerable 
distances, and very nearly in parallel lines. M. Brongniart aptly comparea 



486 Natttral Histmy in Foreign Countries. 

them to the little mounds of sand or gravel formed in streams of running 
water, when interrupted by a large stone, or any other obstacle. One ose^ 
in particular, named Kinnekulle, and situated on the shore of the Lake 
VVenern, at the foot of a plateau of basalt, is composed of sand and black 
coloured blocks, in form of a cue from north to south. Here the origin of 
these blocks is obvious ; for they consist of the same basalt as the plateau, 
from which they have been detached, and transported to different distances. 
Upon the plateau of Kinnekulle there are many blocks of granite of consi- 
siderable size, and also similar masses of the inferior sandstone, presenting 
a striking example of primary rocks, placed upon rocks of newer formation, 
and also upon alluvial soil of more recent origin. 

M. Brongniart remarked, that both in Sweden and in many sub-Alpine and 
sub-Apennine hills, in proportion as the transported blocks are nearer the 
summit they increase in size. Thus, in going towards the summit of Su- 
perga, near Turin, the blocks at the bottom of the hill are little more 
than boulders ; towards the middle they are several pounds' weight, while 
near the top they are large. A British instance, no less striking, of the same 
fact, may be seen in Conversations on Geology ^ p. 122.

Fishes peculiar to certain Lakes. — Several travellers confirm the account 
given by Josephus {Antiq. iii. 18. and De Bcllo Jud., &c.), that the fishes of 
the Lake of Gennesareth are peculiar to it. Hasselquist says, " I thought 
it remarkable, that the same kind offish should here be met with as in the 
Nile, such as Charmuth, 5'ilurus, Boenni, Mulsil, and /Sparus galilae'us. 
Josephus says that some consider the fountain of Capernaum as a vein of 
the Nile, because it brings forth fishes resembling the Coracinus of the 
Alexandrine Lake. 

Supposed Change of Climate. — Professor Schouw, of Copenhagen, has 
ai'gued plausibly against the opinion, that certain climates have changed in 
the lapse of ages. The date tree, for instance, he says, requires a mean 
temperature of 78° Fahr., to bring its fruit to perfection; and it is as suc- 
cessfully cultivated in Palestine now as it was in the earliest times, of which 
he gives interesting notices. Jericho was called Palm town ; and Deborah's 
palm tree was mentioned between Rama and Bethel. Pliny mentions the 
palm tree as being frequent in ,Judea, and chiefly about Jericho. Tacitus, 
Josephus, Strabo, Diodorus Siculus, and Theophrastus, all speak of woods 
of palm trees there ; and on the Hebrew coins date trees are by no means 
rare, and are easily recognised by their fruit. (O/ceii's Isis.) 

Coral F6lj/pi. — MM. Quoy and Gaimard, the naturalists of the Astro- 
labe, in her late voyage of discovery, paid considerable attention to thjp 
habits of the numerous Polypi inhabiting corals and corallines, and have 
thrown some light on their history. They always found, on examining with 
attention, that the Polypi protrudetl only a very little their lamellar and 
fringed tentacula (les etoiles lamelleuses et decoupees) from their abode, 
a circumstance which gives them a very peculiar appearance. In some 
Milleporae, the animals are very obvious, though in others they cannot be 
seen ; but on passing the hand along the surface, the touch does not indi- 
cate the feeling of an immediately stony basis. In some, no organic sub- 
stance can be perceived, the surface being rough and dry, as the most arid 
limestone ; but in others, such as the elk's-horn, though similarly rough and 
dry, very minute Polypi, can be detected burrowing in the stony matter. It 
may be remarked, that touching those Polypi produces the same stinging 
sensation, followed by redness, as that produced by certain Medus<^, which 
has obtained for them the name of sea-nettles. The sting of the Polypi, it 
would appear, is produced by some acrid fluid, for it is communicable from 
the hands to any other part of the skin. 

MM. Quoy and Gaimard could find no trace of animation in the sub- 
stances called NuUiporae, by Lamarck, from their exhibiting no perceptible 
pores. They profess entire ignorance of their manner of growth. 

Corals and corallines of recent formation are much more porous and 
fragile than when of some age; because the interstices, in the former case, 
have not been filled up, and even the parts which have been formed require 
exposure to the air to consolidate and harden them. 

No Polypi appear to possess, as has by some been supposed, life or ani- 
mation in common. If they did, they would enjoy, as M. Lamarck shrewdly 
observes, qualities repugnant to the nature of every known animal, namely 
the faculty of never dying. The stars and rosettes of the Polypi, therefore.

however numerous, and however closely contiguous, have no mutual commu- 
nication, nor continuity of substance ; the only evidence indeed of which 
is the instantaneous and simultaneous retreat by the Polypi into their cells, 
when accidentally disturbed. 

It has been supposed by some naturalists, and is universally believed by 
the negroes, that fish are rendered poisonous by feeding on the coral P61ypi ; 
but MM. Quoy and Gaimard argue, that the flat obtuse nose of fishes can- 
not possibly detach the Polypi from their encasements. In the instance of 
fish which have jaws strong enough to break coral, such as the Diodon 
caeruleus, whose stomach they found filled with fragments of Madreporae, 
no nation is known to eat them. In the Mariannes they are looked upon 
with disgust.

Impressions on Rocks. — About two miles south of Brasstown, in the 
United States of America, there is a mountain which is called the En- 
chanted Mountain, celebrated for the curious impressions, resembling 
the tracks of turkeys, bears, horses, and human beings, found on its rocky 
surface, as perfect as they could be made on snow or sand. {Lon. Gen.

Mount Sorata. — From the observations of Mr. Pentland it appears that 
the Nevado de Sorata is the highest mountain in America. It is situated 
towards the northern prolongation of the eastern Cordillera, and almost in 
the centre of a group of snow-covered pics. Its latitude is 1 '>° 50' south, 
and it is to the east of the large village of Sorata inhabited by native Peru- 
vians. Mr. Pentland has determined its height to be 25,200 feet, by means 
of trigonometrical observations taken on the shores of the lake Titicaca, 
compared with the usual limits of perpetual snow in this climate, namely, 
17,100 ft. 

It is composed of transition slate in which porphyritic syenite abounds, 
traversed by auriferous veins, from which particles of gold are washed down 
into the streams which run into the Rio Beni, that runs through the cele- 
brated El Dorado. 

Mr. Pentland announces that he will publish, in a few months, the 
detail of his observations upon this and the other mountains of the Andes, 
as well as his researches into the history, antiquities, geography, and natural 
history of Bolivia, or Upper Peru. (Annates dcs Sciences, xiv. 299.) 

Alimnt Illimani. — The Nevados de Illimani, the second American moun- 
tain in point of altitude, is situated in the province of Paz, in Bolivia, or 
Upper Peru, and twenty marine leagues south-east of the city of Paz. It is 
farther south than any of the other snowy pics of the eastern Cordilleras ; 
and, according to the astronomical observations taken near its northern 
base by Mr. Pentland, it is situated between 15*^35^ ayid 16° 40' south 
latitude, and between 67° and 68° west longitude. Its summit forms a 
ridge traversed by four pics in a line parallel to the axis of the chain, and 
lying north and south. The most northern of these pics is 24,200, and the 
most southern appeared to Mr. Pentland still higher, but he has not yet 
determined the exact difference. 

The mountain is composed of grauwack^ or transition slate, the beds of 
which are often separated by strata of quartz rock and flinty slate. These 
are associated with porphyritic syenite and true granite veins, beds, or stra- 
tified masses. The transition slate is traversed by numerous veins of vitreous 
quartz, containing particles of native gold or auriferous pyrites. Some of 
these veins, at the height of 16,000 ft., appear to have been explored by 
the ancient Peruvians. 

Captain Basil Hall, it appears, has objected to the statements of Mr. 
Pentland that Illimani cannot be seen from the sea, forgetting that it is 310 
geographical miles from the coast, and could not there be seen.

Land Crabs. — In the forests of Guam, more than a mile from the shore, 
MM. Quoy and Gaimard found a very large species of Pagura, with violet 
claws, lodged in the shells of ^uccina, and covered with an earthy crust, 
which appears to be their constant abode. Some of these Paguraj had the 
faculty of emitting a sort of froth when they were irritated. They were 
attracted by light ; for one night, when encamped on shore, the sailors 
lighted a fire, and a large Pagura came towards it from a considerable dis- 
tance, and became the victim of his curiosity, being cooked in his own house, 
and afterwards devoured. 

It appears that there are two divisions of this tribe ; one living on land, 
the other in water ; the marine species being distinguished by rounded eyes, 
set upon the extremities of long cylindric peduncles. The land species, on 
the approach of danger, always retreat, either into accidental crevices or 
holes, or preferably under the roots or into the hollow trunks of trees ; 
never, or, at least, rarely, into the sea, though it be near them.

Liverpool Botanic Garden. — A clever sketch of the origin, rise, progress, 
and present state of this establishment is given in the Albion, a Liver- 
pool newspaper, for June 4. 1S27, from which we make the following 
extract : — 

" The garden was laid out, about twelve years ago, under the auspices of 
several gentlemen, amongst whom was the venerable and gifted Mr. lloscoe, 
and its success has fully equalled the most sanguine expectations. It com- 
prises five acres of land, and is well enclosed by a stone wall, which is over- 
topped by a thriving hedge, giving it at once privacy and shelter. The 
ground narrows towards the north, and terminates in the frontage formed 
by the gate, and two plain lodges on each side of it. The visitor, after sur- 
veying the monotony of the surrounding fields, which are barren and 
mossy, is agreeably surprised to find himself embowered, on entering within 
the inner gate, in shady walks skirted by the choicest ornamental shrubs and 
trees. On leaving this pleasure-ground, which is laid out with much taste, 
and contains an extensive rockery, in which, amongst many curious speci- 
mens of stones and minerals, are seen a fragment of the Giant's Causeway, 
the conservatory presents itself, an erection of great magnitude and ele- 
gance of structure {fig. 203.), extending across nearly the whole breadth of 
the ground, and sheltered, at the back, by a row of black Italian poplars. 
The middle apartment of this splendid range is the most lofty, and projects 
with a semicircular front, supported by four handsome Ionic colunms. At 
each end is a similar projecting apartment, on a smaller scale and less 
elaborate in style. From the latter, spacious walks run southward to the 
bottom of the garden, which also terminates in a delightful pleasure-ground, 
variegated by beautiful shrubs, amongst which are observed the copper 
beech, the scarlet thorn, the snow-drop tree, and numbers of tribes of 
rhododendrons, and every choice shrub which will flourish in the open air. 
This ground embraces also the angle at the southwest corner, formed by 
the widening of the ground to the south ; the main portion, for the culture 
of fine flowers, being embraced in a square, running parallel with the east 
wall. Nothing can be better contrived upon the allotted space than the 
windings of the walks in the pleasure-ground, the margins of which are 
closely carpeted with grass, affording a variety of occasional glades or 
recesses.

* Where, all unseen, the cavalier 
j\I;iypour his love in maiden's ear, 
And kiii the hand he loves so dear,' 

" The main portion of the garden is divided, by luxuriant hedges of privet 
and beech intermixed, into eight sheltering compartments, in which are 
arranged, after the system of Linnaeus, the several classes of plants. The 
neat and appropriate manner in which these are laid out in beds, intersected 
by minor walks, and affording, at each progressing step of the visitor, new 
objects of admiration, can only be estimated by inspection. Suffice it here 
to state, that the collection is copious, and comprises all the rare tribes and 
varieties in every class of Linnaeus, beginning with the second and ending 
with the twenty-fourth. The health and vigour of the plants, numbers of 
which are delicate to rear, ' bearing,' as they do in their alternate seasons, 
* their blushing honours thick upon them,' is the highest testimonial of the 
taste and liberality of the proprietors, and of the skill of Mr. Shepherd, 
the superintendent botanist. Their several tribes and species are distinctly 
labeled on small white boards, thus affording to the botanical student the 
utmost facility in his researches. In the borders the shrubs and flowers are 
placed, indiscriminately, in a pleasing variety; and the attention of the 
lounger is often arrested to examine some hitherto unobserved, beautiful, or 
extraordinary relative of the numerous famil}' of Flora. The collection 
also embraces many varieties of mosses, and creej)ing shrubs, and grasses ; 
and we never beheld richer specimens of the P^sonia and the genus 7>el- 
phiniura.

" ^ye now^ return to the conservatory. In front is a spacious walk, on 
each side of which are placed commodious garden seats. Olose to this, and 
bstween it and the main compartments of the garden to the south, is a rich 
grass-plot, decorated with shrubs and trees at each end, and in the middle 
beautified by an extensive oval pond, full of pure water, and partially over- 
grown with the yellow and white water-lily, the bulrush, and other rarer 
aquatic plants. 'I'he enchantment of this delightful little sheet of water is 
such, that it is found necessary to encircle a considerable space round its 
margin with an almost invisible wire fence, to prevent the banks from being 
trodden in. The pond abounds with the silver and gold fish, which, at this 
season, when they are about casting their scales, are either purely scarlet or 
gold coloured, white and glittering like silver, or present a motley appear- 
ance of both. Here arc also tench and carj) (some of the former two or

three pounds* weight) living in harmony with their feebler but more beautiful 
finny brethren ; and all are so much accustomed to be fed with bread by 
the ladies who visit them, that they exhibit no shyness at the approach of 
strangers, and, swimming to the edge, seem to implore a crumb or two from 
every passer by. The conservatory is divided into five compartments or 
chambertf, of which the three in the middle are maintained at a high tem- 
perature for East and West Indian, South American, and South Sea Island 
productions. The two at the extremities are reserved for the finer plants, 
which are affected only by the sharpness of the winter, and are, at this 
season, nearly stripped of their inmates, which are deposited in a warm 
recess behind the building, formed of a thick enclosure of hedging." 

Accidental Preservaiion of Hen^s Egg Shells. — As some workmen were 
employed in repairing a part of the building of the New Inn, Gloucester, 
in removing a lead spout, they discovered a hen's nest, containing eleven 
eggs, which must have been deposited there about two centuries ago ! The 
shells of the eggs were perfect, but of a very dark colour, and the inside 
quite dried up. {Cheltenham Chronicle , Feb.) 

Coleopterous Insects driven fi'om their Winter Quartei-s. — The marshes 
and low meadows about Bungay were flooded for several days in January last, 
and the water was as high as had been known for some years. This produced 
a very singular spectacle on the 19th and 20th of that month; but espe- 
cially on the 19th, when, from the rushing down of the waters, the insects, 
chiefly coleopterous, were driven from their winter quarters, and being 
washed to the land, had taken refuge by crawUng up the posts by the side 
of Earshara dam, adjoining the town, and in such numbers as to be truly 
astonishing. I have no doubt from the quantity which I saw floating on 
the water, but myriads must have been destroyed. — D. S. Bungay ,

Mineral Waters. — Dr. Thomas Thomson, the distinguished Professor 
of Chemistry in the University of Glasgow, has just published an excellent 
memoir on the mineral springs of Scotland, in the Glasgow MedicalJoumal, 
now on our table, from which we shall abridge his remarks on the sulphu- 
reous and chalybeate waters. 

Moffat Water. — The village of Moffat lies at the bottom of a range of 
transition hills, consisting of greywacke, transition green stone, and transi- 
tion slate ; and, though Dr. Thomson did not observe any alum slate, he 
thinks it not improbable that the spring originates in it ; but the rocks in 
the vicinity are so covered with soil, as to preclude examination. Dr. Gar- 
nett, who resided for a summer at Moffat, 'found that a wine-gallon of the 
water contained 36 grain? of common salt, 10 cubic inches of sulphuretted 
hydrogen ; 4 cubic inches of azotic gas, and 5 cubic inches of carbonic acid 
gas. Dr. Thomson found the constituents of an imperial gallon to be as 
follows : — 

Sulphuretted hydrogen gas - 21 '290 cubic inches. 

Common salt - - - 176-5C9 grains. 

Sulphate of soda - - 16-562

Strathpefer Water. — These wells are situated in the valley of Strath-

new red sandstone, and not far from Ben Wevis, one of the most conspi- 
cuous mountains in the north of Scotland. When the temperature of the 
air was 60^, Dr. Thomson found that of one of the springs 39° and of the 
other 39f°. The upper well was obviously the strongest, and had a smell 
of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, with a specific gravity of r00193. The im-

in the possession of Mr. David Buist, land-surveyor, Perth, is the lower 
jaw-bone of a shark, with the teeth entire and in good preservation, found 
below the surface of the ground, in the inland part of the county of Perth. 
Mr. Buist is silent as to the locality, expecting yet to find some other 
remains of the skeleton near the place. (Dundee Courier, May 9th.)'

Rare Bird. — It is now above 20 years since, in visiting my friend Mr.

his cherries. After two or three unsuccessful attempts on the part of Mr, 
Lane, the bird at hist fell to my barrel. It was about the size of a starling, 
and resembled that bird in its manner of standinfr and flying, more than any 
{>ird I am acquainted with. The tail was, I think, rather longer, and more 
like that of a blackbird. The head, and down half the neck, save the bill, 
which was yellow, and a large tuft of feathers on the crown, the colour of 
the back ; the wings and the tail were a beautiful, glossy, jet black ; the 
back, breast, and belly (the latter somewhat lighter) were the colour of the 
Royston crow, hut beautifully speckled all over, at regular distances, about 
1 in. apart, with three small bright red spots placed equidistantly in tri- 
angles, not in regular lines, but becoming more crowded towards the neck. 
The tuft on the head was of the same ash colour as the body, but I am 
uncertain whether this was also speckled or not. This tuft the bird seemed 
to have the power of raising at pleasure. Its cry resembled that of the 
water ouzel, and its legs and feet those of the starling. It was quite a rara 
avis in this country, no one knowing anything of it ; nor could any descrip- 
tion of it be found in BufFon, Goldsmith, Mavor, or Bewick. Whether this 
bird was a strayed exotic, or a variety or mule of any indigenous species, I 
am not sufficiently acquainted with natural history to say. Mule birds, 
even in their wild state, are sometimes met with. I once saw a perfectly 
white starling among a flock of them, by the road-side; and a nearly white 
hen-sparrow, for several years, had her nest within 20 yards of my bed-room 
window. 

This strange cherry-bird was given, for the purpose of being preserved in 
the Dublin Museum, to Mr. Healy Button, who happened to be in the 
neighbourhood, collecting materials for his statistical survey of the county, 
at the time it was killed. Whether it was preserved and lodged in the 
museum or not, I have never learned, nor indeed have I ever enquired ; but 
I should think, from even the imperfect description given above, it might, 
if in existence, be identified : at any rate, my account may call the attention 
of some ornithologist, who may be pleased to give his opinion as to what 
this stranger really was. — Cliarles Adams Drew. Ennisy June 25. 1828. 



• Art. V. Calendar of Nature for London, 

The remarkably mild and open weather which has prevailed since our 
last report, has been attended with its usual consequences, viz. late vege- 
table productions, as flowers, &c., rarely seen in the months of November 
and December. 

Early flowers, as the primrose, polyanthus, and Christmas rose, are already 
in bloom. The song-thrush frequently, and the redbreast constantly, 
singing. 

Many insects still swarm under hedges ; and the blind beetle (Geotr6pes 
stercorarius) is seen on wing every evening. 

The weather, since our last, has only been varied by two or three frosty 
nights in the early part of November, and a storm trf thunder about the 8th 
instant. — J. M. Dec. 23. 1 828.

Art. VII. Queries and Answers. 

The Heather hluiter of the Scotch (p. 297.) is the common bittern, mire- 
drum, or marsh-boomer (^'rdea stellaris Linn.) ; and the sound of the bird 
is so very coumion, that every child is familiar with it, though the birds, 
from being shy, are not often seen. The poet Thomson seems to have had 
a very erroneous notion of the manner in which the bird produces the noise, 
when he says, 

" So that scarce 

The bittern knows his time, with bill engulpht, ', 
To shake the sounding marsh." Seasons. 

On the contrary, I have repeatedly remarked that the bittern usually 
booms while flying high in the air. Its lofty spiral flight, indeed, is a mat- 
ter of common remark. 

" Swift as the bittern soars on spiral wing." Southey. 

A line which, I may remark, is not very ornithological ; inasmuch as neither 
the bittern, nor any other bird, has spiral wings. Southey, however, seems 
to be well acquainted with the boom of the bittern.

Numbers, with a few remarks upon the gizzard of the Bulla lignaria. I am

other species of shell fish. A little information on this subject will greatly

Organisation of Plaiits. — I take a great interest in the physiology of botany, 
and have often lamented the insufficiency of microscopes to enable me to 
ascertain the organisation of plants From a number of the Library of Use- 
ful Knowledge, I learn that this enquiry is facilitated, by plunging the parts 
to be examined in a phial of nitric acid, placing the phial in boiling water, 
and keeping it at the boiling point for 12 or 15 minutes. I have tried this, 
but cannot succeed ; the contents of the phial, when taken out, were merely 
the acid, and a portion of pulp totally disorganised, and in a state of eifer- 
vescence that would adniit of no examination, had there been anything to 
examine. I tried it with half the boiling, but, even then, the parts were one 
confused mass, from which nothing could be underntood. Can you give me 
any information about this ; or, if not, will you put a query to that effect in 
the Magazine ? — E.K. August 3. 1828.

Food of the Lapwing. — Under Art. Zoology, p. 374., on the mis- 
takes of instinct in animals, it is said that " the lapwing, when it cannot 
find a sufficiency of slugs, pats the ground with its feet, to bring forth 
earthworms." That the lapwing devours slugs is enough to propitiate the 
farmers in favour of the bird, however averse they may be from the land they 
frequent. I have often tried to discover what the food of these birds was, 
but never could be satisfied on this point. Within the last month I de- 
sired a gamekeeper (Nash, gamekeeper to G. Farley, Esq., Crowie House, 
Worcestershire) to shoot a couple, out of hundreds which frequented a 
field of fallow then sowing with wheat. I saw them opened. The gizzard 
contained small stones, and morsels of greevi vegetable matter. The vessel 
which the gamekeeper called the trail, was chai'ged with a thick mucus, in 
which were small stones, pieces of the (Elytra of small beetles, and seeds of 
some species of Polygonum ; but no slugs (though the field swarmed with 
them), earthworms, wheat (of eating which the birds were accused by 
the bailiff), nor any other matter whjch could be (V -tinguished. 

I have often observed that the lapwing finds some part of its food a little 
way below the surface of the ground, as the moist sides of the furrows are 
full of perforations made with their bills. At the same time, I have noticed 
very little hills of fine earth, resembling those of the little ground bee, 
thrown up out of round cavities or cells, each of which contains the larva 
of some insect of the beetle tribe, as they are in colour like those of the 
ladybird, but in shape and size very like the Lepisma sacchaiina. These 
larva, I suspected, might be the prey of the lapwing ; but this I never could 
determine. — M. 

Foreifrn Wtgi^atory Birds, (y). ^16.) — On the notice respecting the introduc- 
tion of foreign or migratory song birds, J, R. seems to doubt whether redbreasts 
would take to strange eggs, because, he says, " they readily forsake their 
own, if touched." J. R. ought to have known, that, though redbreasts, as 
well as other birds, will forsake their eggs and nests, if disturbed in the 
early part of the season, or while they are laying, they seldom do so after 
they have begun to sit. Mr. Anderson only stated facts. — M. 

J. R., in reply to these remarks, professes his ignorance of the circum- 
stance that birds seldom forsake their nests after beginning to sit, and is 
certain of many particular facts authorising a contrary opinion. Many birds 
will forsake their young, much more their eggs, of which the domestic pigeon 
is a well-known example. 

Biography of J. Templeton^ Esq. (p. 403.) — Sir, The biography of the 
late Mr. Templeton, which has been commenced in the last Number of the 
Magazine of Natural History was not written by me. This I stated to you 
before, a circumstance, which, in consequence,! suppose, of the manuscript 
coming through my hands, had been overlooked. It is the composition of 
the Rev. Thos. D. Hincks, M.R.I.A., and Principal of the Classical Dej>art- 
ment of the Belfast Institution. Mr. Hincks was, when he read the paper. 
President of the Belfast Natural History Society, but on account of a mul- 
tiplicity of engagements, he resigned that office, and I was elected to it. 
The very interesting account of our late excellent naturalist, has been given 
!)y Mr. Hincks in such a way as might be looked for from one of his long 
acknowledged talents and extensive erudition, and is much superior to any 
thing I could have produced on the subject. I therefore re(juest that you 
will publish this note in your next, and alter the heading of the article in 
your continuations of Mr. Templeton's life. By so doing, you will much 
oblige your constant wellwisher. — Jas. L. Drummond. Belfast^ Dec, 6,
