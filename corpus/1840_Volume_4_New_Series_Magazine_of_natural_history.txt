Art. I. — View of the Fauna of Brazil, previous to the last Geolo- 
gical Revolution.^ By Dr. Lund.^ 

Dr. Lund commences his account by explaining the circum- 
stances under which the fossil remains he is about to describe 
are found. " They are all found," he says, "in the caves 
which occur in the calcareous rocks that traverse, in various 
directions the interior Highlands of Brazil. A mountain 
chain composed of this rock diverges from the principal chain 
of the central plateau (Serra do Espinha^o) in the neighbour- 
hood of the capital of the Province Minas, and extends to- 
wards the north west, dividing the waters of the rivers Rio 
das Velhas and Paraopeba. It is this chain which has hi- 
therto formed the richest field of my researches ; and indeed 
it is to the caves on its eastern declivity that I am indebted for 
all the relics of the inhabitants of a former world which I yet 
possess. Its western side presents fewer caves, and I have 
not been so fortunate as to find any trace of animal remains 
in them, any more than in the numerous caverns contained in 
the other small limestone chains connected with the above 
principal range. 

The rock of which these chains is composed is a dark grey, 
fine-grained, crystalline, transition limestone, disposed in ho- 
rizontal strata, which not unfrequently exhibit a very gentle 

' This is a nearly literal translation of Dr. Lund's own title, but it is by 
no means descriptive of this first paper, at least, which is merely introduc- 
tory, and might be better entitled, — "An Account of the Limestone Caves 
in the Interior Highlands of Brazil ; with a description of the Mammalia 
now occurring in that district." His second paper is entitled — "A Survey 
or Sketch of the extinct species of Mammalia which inhabited the High- 
lands of Tropical Brazil, previously to the last Geological Revolution." —

dip to the east. It rests iii^on a vast mass of talc slate, which 
dips at an angle of 90° to the east, and forms the outermost 
member in connection with the higher central range : and 
farther from this principal chain, it alternates w ith beds of 
siliceous and clay slates. It often contains veins of quartz, 
but I have never yet found in it any trace either of metals or 
of organic remains. These limestone hills form smooth, 
rounded ranges, which, however, have often a wild and pic- 
turesque character, from the extraordinary disruption of their 
masses, and the projection of their bare and steep walls of 
rock. They are also clothed with a peculiar vegetation ; and 
among the isolated outliers of this same formation, are nu- 
merous lakes. Another physical phenomenon peculiar to the 
limestone district, is the sudden disappearance of rivers (Su- 
midouro), which again emerge at greater or less distances. — 
This phenomenon arises from the number of fissures by which 
the limestone is traversed, both above and below the surface. 
Of the form of these fissures no universal description can be 
given. Sometimes they appear as perpendicular clefts, run- 
ning in one direction ; sometimes they are intersected by a 
number of transverse fissures; sometimes they run in zigzags ; 
but often expand into passages, chambers, halls, and other 
similar forms, in which breadth predominates. It is more 
particularly this latter form of which I think it necessary to 
give a more detailed description. 

The first thing that strikes the observer in these caves, is 
the rounded form presented by them. The roof is arched, 
and passes into the side walls by a regular curve. The floor 
can seldom be seen ; but when visible, it exhibits the same 
mode of junction with the sides ; and it is impossible to avoid 
remarking, that all the angles which project at the different 
divisions or bends of the passages, are in like manner roundetl 
off. If we examine the walls and roof more carefully, we 
perceive that the surface of the rock is full of protuberances 
and hollow^s, blending into each other with the gentlest curve. 
But especially do we observe numerous round holes, of all 
sizes, both in the sides and roof, which penetrate more or less 
deeply into the rock, and are closed at the bottom. Fre- 
quently, where the walls project beyond the regular line, these 
holes penetrate from one side to the other, and thus form pas- 
sages, usually narrow, but sometimes large enough to admit 
of our creeping through them, and presenting, on a smaller 
scale, the same phenomena already described in speaking of 
the principal passages. 

The surface of the stone is moreover smooth, often to such 
a degree as to reflect light : which circumstance, combined

with the rounded forms assumed, frequently gives the rocky 
masses the appearance of bronze statues. 

The number of caves already visited by me in Brazil, 
amounts to eighty-eight, to the whole of which the charac- 
ters here described are more or less applicable ; and these 
characters are such as, in my opinion, leave no doubt as to 
the mode of formation of the caves. In traversing them, one 
appears to be walking by the rock-bound shore of ocean, and 
to see its naked cliffs as they are hollowed and smoothed by 
the waves. And doubtless, such is their origin ; doubtless, 
we must assign the formation of these caverns to those peri- 
ods when either this whole tract, that is now dry land, was 
covered with vast lakes ; or when it yet rested in the bosom 
of the sea. At any rate, it is certain that the filtration of wa- 
ter through the limestone, is quite insufficient to explain the 
phenomena we have been describing, and particularly the 
deep yet blind holes gnawed into the roof. 

All these caves are more or less filled with soil, which I 
will take the liberty of describing, by giving a short account 
of the newest fonnation that covers the surface in this part of 
Brazil : it is exactly the same as that which is found inside 
the caverns. 

The plains, the valleys, and the lower hills are, without 
exception, overspread by a vast layer of loose soil, from which 
the higher ranges alone are free. This stratum, with a cer- 
tain degree of uniformity combines no inconsiderable variety, 
which is partly shown in its subordinate beds, and partly in 
the occasional appearance of these beds, without any such 
sequence, by the side of each other. The most common form 
assumed by these formations, is that of a stratum of coarse, 
red clay, from ten to thirty or more feet in thickness, in which 
there is no trace of stratification or other divisions. Occa- 
sionally we may follow this clay -bed over considerable tracts, 
without observing any remarkable extraneous substance; but 
it usually contains, in a greater or less quantity, rolled stones 
of quartz, from the size of a pigeon's egg to that of a man's 
head. These boulders are sometimes strewed about without 
order ; sometimes they form more or less regular beds. In- 
termixed with these rolled quartz stones are found, but in far 
less quantity, similarly rolled fragments of the other kinds of 
rock belonging to this district ; and it is out of this same soil 
that the natives obtain gold and diamonds by washing. — 
Quartz is also found in this bed of clay, under another form 
still more common in the Province of Minas, namely, that of 
sharp angular fragments, grouped together so as to form 
regular beds, of from six to eighteen inches thick, and fre- 



4 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

quently of considerable extent. This siliceous stratum has 
no uniform depth in the clay, but often approaches the sur- 
face, and then forms the * Gruns Campos ' so characteristic of 
that country, and so unfriendly to agriculture, though clothed 
with so peculiar a vegetation. Amongst this quartz occur, 
although sparingly, fragments of other rocks, particularly of 
ironstone. ' The colour of the clay occasionally passes from 
red into dull ochre-yellow : and this change in colour is usu- 
ally accompanied by a greater degree of fineness and unifor- 
mity of composition, with some slight trace of cleavage, or 
separation into cubical masses. I have hitherto had no op- 
portunity of observing these beds of clay alternating with beds 
of sand ; whereas this last formation appears on the surface 
over an extent of many degrees in length, in the broad vale 
watered by the St. Francisco river. 

But the most peculiar character under which these newest 
formations present themselves in Brazil, is that called in this 
country " Tapanhoacanga," or negro-head. This formation 
is seen, like a stream of lava, spread over the plains, valleys, 
and hills, nay, even on the highest mountain-ridges of Brazil. 
It is most common in those districts where there are iron- 
stone rocks of the older formations. It consists of a ferrugi- 
nous conglomerate, composed of rolled and angular fragments 
of quartz, and other rocks of the country ; but chiefly of the 
iron formation itself, such as ferriferous mica slate &c., united 
by a ferruginous cement of red, yellow, or black colour. Oc- 
casionally, the fragments disappear, and the cementing sub- 
stance alone remains. It forms a mass almost as hard as 
stone, with a smooth and often shining surface ; inside, it is 
full of vescicular holes, which give it the appearance of a slag. 
It very often contains stone marrow, and in general the same 
minerals that form the constituent portions of the common red 



* The origin of this quartz-hed was long a puzzle to me, until more care- 
ful examinations of the principal mountain range enlightened me on the 
subject. One of the most important members in the composition of that 
range is a vast mass of talc slate, with numerous veins and subordinate beds 
of quartz. This talc slate, in most places, and to considerable depths, is 
in such a state of decomposition, as to crumble between the fingers, and 
the quartz separates with the touch into larger or smaller angular frag- 
ments. If we examine the beds of diluvium at the foot of this mountain 
chain, we there see the red homogeneous clay replaced by a mass of nothing 
but fragments of talc slate, lying in all directions, but containing also the 
same siliceous layers disposed with more regularity, so as often to look like 
connected quartz beds. That this talc slate is in a secondary position, is 
evident from its irregular stratification ; and if we follow its development 
from the foot of the mountain, it is easy to convince ourselves of its gradual 
passage and change into the common red clay, with its usual siliceous bed.

clay, particularly gold, which is often in sufficient quantity to 
be worked. The same conglomerate is likewise found in the 
caves, and contains the same animal remains as the red clay ; 
so that there can be no doubt of the contemporaneousness of 
their formation. These most recent formations are found in 
the caves, under all the conditions I have thus attempted to 
describe, and in about the same relative proportions as to 
quantity ; the red clay soil being by far the most common, ei- 
ther in a pure state, or mixed with siliceous boulders or gravel. 
But all these kinds of soil have undergone changes since their 
deposition in the caves, of which changes I will now proceed 
to give an account. 

The first change arises from the infiltration of water charged 
with lime. The lime derived from the evaporation of the wa- 
ter, and its contact with the surrounding hard bodies, unites 
the loose particles of the soil, and changes the whole into a 
mass as hard as stone. Indeed, the looser the soil was pre- 
viously to this infiltration, the harder does it afterwards be- 
come, from the greater quantity of calcareous particles which 
it allows to penetrate. For this reason the fine yellow clay 
never becomes so hard as the coarse red, the loose composi- 
tion of which even permits the calcareous incrustation to col- 
lect in connected masses, which are sometimes solid, at other 
times contain holes lined with beautiful small crystals of cal- 
careous spar. Lastly, the beds of boulders and gravel, which 
outside the caves are loose and unconnected, are metamor- 
phosed into perfect pudding-stone inside. Another character 
which distinguishes the soil within the caves from that with- 
out, is the much greater quantity of fragments of limestone 
contained in it. These fragments have their angles partly 
sharp, and partly broken off and rounded ; and are from the 
most trifling size up to that of immense blocks. In those 
caves the opening of which is to the north, and which are 
closed at the end, these fragments are found in extraordinary 
abundance, especially in the inner part, towards the bottom : 
while in those which open to the south, or have two opposite 
entrances, the fragments are either entirely wanting, or occur 
in trifling quantities. This result is based upon the exami- 
nation of so many caverns, that it cannot be looked upon as 
an accidental circumstance : and the natural explanation ap- 
pears to be, that the inundation which deposited the soil in 
these caves, must have moved from north to south, and vnth 
sufficient force to carry along with it the blocks of all sizes 
which we see scattered inside and outside of the caves. 

But the most important substance which has enriched the 
soil since its deposition, is, without doubt, saltpetre, which is 



6 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BIIAZFL 

found in sufficient quantity to become an article of industry 
and export to the neighbouring population. The origin of 
this salt was for a long time obscure to me ; but at length 
numerous observations and experiments have convinced me 
that it is neither formed in the soil where it lies, nor contain- 
ed in the limestone in which the caves occur, but that it owes 
its origin to the bed of mould which lies above the caves. — 
The rain water that filters through this mould becomes charg- 
ed with decomposed vegetable particles, and by contact with 
the limestone in its passage through the fissures, the salt is 
produced. 

Most frequently this bed of soil is covered with a coating of 
stalagmite. In my former communication, describing the cave 
of Maquine, I have drawn attention to the difference in the 
manner and period of formation of this stalagmitic crust, and of 
those columnar and leaf-shaped productions, which, either as 
stalactites, hang from the wall or clothe the roof in a thousand 
fantastic and indescribably beautiful forms, or, as stalagmites, 
rise like enormous pillars or cones from the floor. By far the 
greatest quantity of this stalactitic mass belongs to ages an- 
tecedent to the introduction of the soil, which is seen resting 
on it as a base, just as the soil outside rests on the base of 
the older rocks. A much smaller portion has formed since, 
and indeed it continues daily to increase, even under the eye 
of the observer. On the other hand, the stalagmitic coating 
which covers the surface of the soil, must have been a later 
production, to which many causes have contributed ; these 
causes it is important to distinguish, in order that we may be 
enabled to decide upon the age of the organic remains found 
under the stalagmite. In the communication already referred 
to, I have proved that the formation of the columnar and leaf- 
shaped stalactite is effected by a very slow process. If the 
dripping of the water proceeds too rapidly, its dissipating pow- 
er prevents its setting, and the stalagmitic mass below is hol- 
lowed out, instead of being increased. The calcareous water 
which runs down the sides of the stalagmitic blocks, collects 
in the first hollow it finds near their base. There, and on its 
passage thither, it gradually deposits its lime, and thus there 
is gradually spread round the stalagmite mass, and in the de- 
pressions nearest to it, a calcareous coat, which the water 
continually enlarges, until by the filling up of the first hollow 
it is compelled to flow onward to the next, and so on. The 
splash of each drop that falls upon the stalagmitic mass also 
contributes to form a similar incrustation around it ; as may 
easily be seen from the innumerable small inequalities of the 
surface, which, with the faces of their crystals, often give an

appearance of crystallized sugar to the substances covered by 
them. 

Whoever visits these caverns to admire the beauty of their 
fantastic draperies, will dwell with most pleasure on the for- 
mations of this class : while for the zoologist they possess 
less interest, since the substances they enclose are most com- 
monly of very recent origin. Under the stalagmitic mass, and 
forming, as it were, the nucleus of these " confetti," I have 
often found recent bones of existing animals, shells, nay, even 
a piece of charcoal, probably left by savages. Not unfre- 
quently do we detect nature in the very act of forming these 
incrustations, where, in a heap of bones lying on the floor, 
some are already entirely enveloped in stalagmite, others stick 
half out of it, while others again lie perfectly untouched, and 
awaiting the incrustation that will veil them from our view, 
and preserve them perhaps for the investigations of a future 
generation. Forasmuch as this formation depends on agen- 
cies which are in daily operation on the surface of the earth, 
that it to say, on the infiltration of rain water through the fis- 
sures and pores of limestone, there can be no reason for sup- 
posing that it should not also have been going on at a period 
before the introduction of the soil into the caves : and expe- 
rience has convinced me that this is really the case. I have 
fi'equently had occasion to observe, under the stratum of soil, 
a similar stalagmitic incrustation, with those beautiful basin- 
shaped crystallizations known hereby the name of "Pias," or 
baptismal fonts. 

Besides these originating causes, there is scarcely a cave in 
which we may not see, at least in time of rain, the water drop 
from the roof, and form basins of a larger or smaller size. — 
At the bottom and round the edge of these basins, the same 
phenomena already described occur, and occasion incrusta- 
tions and depressions in the floor. These two modes of for- 
mation of the stalagmitic flooring of many caves are indubi- 
table ; and where passages are narrow, and the quantity of 
stalactite on the roof and walls considerable, they are suffi- 
cient to account for the phenomenon : but at the same time 
they are evidently insufficient, in many respects, to serve as^ 
an universal explanation, as for instance, in the case of those 
wide and spacious halls into which the caverns often expand,, 
where a coating of stalagmite covers the stratum of soil, like 
ice on the surface of the lake, and yet where no dripping from 
the roof betrays the actual presence of incrusting water, — na 
stalagmitic crust on the walls or roof attests its agency in 
time past. 

In the communication already cited, I have drawn atten- 



8 M. SANDER RANG 

tion to the proofs derived from the condition and preservation 
of the bones found in, and immediately under, this calcareous 
tegument, which compel us to conclude that its formation 
dates from the time immediately subsequent to the introduc- 
tion of the soil ; and that it owes its origin to the extraordi- 
nary condition into which the surface of our globe passed, as 
a consequence of the equally extraordinary catastrophe that 
occasioned the destruction of the whole race of animals pre- 
viously existing, and the introduction of their remains into 
the caves. This stalagmitic crust, which, with so few ex- 
ceptions, covers the surface of the soil in all the Brazilian 
caverns, is never found beneath it ; which circumstance con- 
trasts so strongly with the abundance of the stalagmitic blocks 
produced during the remote period that preceded the intro- 
duction of the soil, as to be sufficient, in connection with the 
adduced proofs, to confirm their distinct origin. 

I fear that I must have wearied the Society by dwelling so 
long on this point ; I trust however that its practical impor- 
tance will plead my excuse. Future visitors to these caverns 
may perhaps find here a hint to guide them in their search 
after the treasures contained in them, and in the determina- 
tion of the age of those treasures. The same remark will 
hold good with respect to the observations I shall next pro- 
ceed to offer on the conditions under which the bones are 
found in the caverns.

Thus the intention of the membraniferous arms with which 
certain species of poulps are provided is now known. These 
organs envelope the argonaut-shell as the lobes of the mantle 
in some other kinds oimollusca envelope their shells. But for 
what purpose are they so disposed ? Some naturalists have 
thought, and there are those among the number whose learn- 
ing and talent are incontestible, that the poulp secreted the 
shell by means of its airholes ; would then an opinion be 
more unreasonable which should attribute this secretion to 
the membranes themselves ? The slender form, the fragile

and diaphanous nature of the shell, its sides, which so well 
indicate the different applications of the anterior margin of 
the membrane, its tubercles along the keel, constant in all the 
species ; the coloration of the bases of the arms, correspond- 
ing so well with the colouring of the keel towards the spire; 
— are not these characters, which, more thoroughly investi- 
gated than they have yet been, would tend to support the 
fact of the membranous anns being the organs of secretion ? 
We shall be told that it is not by the aid of their mantle that 
the Mollusca secrete their shells, but by the collar which 
unites them to the opening ; and without doubt this is an 
opinion very justly adopted, and we have proved by more 
than one circumstance, and even in the preceding note, that 
we have for a long time ranged ourselves on the side of this 
opinion ; but the argument does not, for that reason, appear 
to us the less feeble, for admitting it to be proved that it is by 
the collar that the Mollusca secrete their shells, it is also 
proved that there are exceptions to this rule. The mollusc 
of the Nautilus, for example, the shell of which is very solid 
and strong, and must have required two or three kinds of se- 
cretion, has no collar, as a skilful English naturalist teaches 
us by the anatomical examination which he has lately 
made, and in which we find no mention of these organs. — 
Now if the mollusc of the nautilus, without the aid of a col- 
lar, has constructed a shell so strong, so heavy, and so emi- 
nently calcareous, surely we may believe that the mollusc of 
the argonaut, likewise a cephalopod, is equally capable of 
constructing a shell without such aid. Such a supposition, 
according to our view, is so much the more admissible, be- 
cause the argonaut, by nature delicate, flexible, and submem- 
branous, would seem to favour such a theory much more 
readily than the nautilus. Would it then be very strange 
that the lobes of the large arms should possess the property 
of secreting this slender shell, and that it is but a mere mem- 
branous pellicle in its early stage ? Do not the lobes of the 
mantle of the Mollusca w^hich form the cowries and the olives, 
secrete calcareous layers, which change, in such a remarka- 
ble manner, the original aspect of these shells, and ultimately 
add largely to their thickness ? 

M. de Blainville, who rejects with all the weight of his 
authority this line of argument, has, from the very first, 
sought to re-consign the use of these membraniferous arms, 
with which we have made him acquainted, to the wants 
of the poulp of the argonaut, and, having so done, has pressed 
it into the service of parasitism. Indeed this philosopher 
points out to us, that since the poulp, as is now perfectly 

Vol. IV.— No. 37, n. s. c 



10 M. SANDER RANG 

known, does not adhere to its shell by a muscle, or even a 
collar, it is therefore very necessary that it should have some 
organ to hold it by ; and, if we do not deceive ourselves, 
there lay perhaps one of the difficulties which most clogged 
this naturalist in developing his whole ideas upon the para- 
sitism of the mollusc in question, for it was impossible, with 
the knowledge which he has of the organization of this ani- 
mal, that he should believe, like some naturalists, that the 
poulp made use of its suckers as a means by which to adhere 
to its shell. M. de Blainville sees then, in this abnormal or- 
ganization of the large arms of the poulp, an arrangement 
necessary for its maintaining its position in the shell that it 
inhabits, and, without which, it would be every moment ex- 
posed to the loss of it. This is a fact incontestably demon- 
strated, and which cannot fail to be adopted indifferently by 
the partisans of non-parasitism, and those of parasitism. 

Should it be objected, (for it is necessary as much as possible 
to anticipate objections), that the poulp can have no need to 
cling so strongly to its shell, because the effort that it makes 
to expel the water from its branchial cavity, when swimming, 
far from tending to separate the two, only on the contrary 
brings them closer together ; — it would be easy for us to re- 
ply, that the movement does not consist merely of removal : 
and, that without speaking of shocks, of the agitation of the 
waves, &c., it is very natural to suppose that when the mol- 
lusc crawls along, carrying its shell with the opening turned 
downwards, the shell could not fail to escape, and mount to 
the surface of the water, on account of the air which it indu- 
bitably contains, if the poulp did not retain it by some means 
as constant and as powerful as those which it possesses. 

The position of the large arms with their membranes over 
the shell, and the service which they render to the poulp, 
being once made known and adopted, let us see what are the 
inferences which may yet be drawn from this fact to throw 
light upon the question, and simplify it from the chaos of ar- 
guments presented on all sides, and generally derived from 
facts wrongly intei-preted, or from pure imagination. 

Those naturalists who have turned their attention to the 
argonaut, have been very little agreed as to the relative posi- 
tion of the poulp to its shell ; and from this there has re- 
sulted — first, the inconvenience of not being able sooner to 
explain the use of the membraniferous arms; — and, secondly, 
a supply of weapons to the partisans of parasitism ; for these 
latter have skilfully seized upon this disagreement to draw 
from it this certainly rather rational argument, that, since the 
mollusc adheres sometimes in one manner, and sometimes in 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 11 

another, it is a proof that the shell has not been made for it, 
and does not belong to it : this part of the question being 
one of the most important, we shall pause here a little. 

Poli, who, from what he says, must have thoroughly in- 
spected this animal in a living state, places its great arms in 
front, that is to say, at the anterior edge of the opening. — 
Ferussac, who has reproduced the beautiful, but too fabulous 
sketch of Poli, has, like that naturalist, placed it the wrong 
way, at the same time sketching other figures in a proper 
manner, which, on the part of one of the most ardent parti- 
sans of non-parasitism was a serious fault; but, at least, 
proved his candour in the discussion. However, in 1836, 
upon some information which we gave him from Algiers, and, 
we believe also, in consequence of some observations of M. 
Delle Chiaje, or Verany, he resolved to make a new copy of 
the plate borrowed from Poli, in order to turn the animal the 
opposite way, which is in fact the true one. It has been 
wrongly thought that he made this change only that he might 
not leave such weapons in the hands of his adversaries ; — 
on the contrary, it was the result of conviction in his mind. 

It is very clear, as to the rest, that Ferussac had adopted 
the idea that the palmated arms were to be found on the side 
of the spiral line of the shell; since, from 1825, as may be 
seen by the memoir which he read to the Academy, he sup- 
posed that the palmated portions of the gveai tetitacula folded 
themselves into a globular mass in the spiral cavity of the 
shell, which he would not have been able to point out if he 
had thought that these arms were in the anterior part. 

M. Delle Chiaje, whose observations will always be of 
great weight in all questions of malacological organization, 
has not been happy in this circumstance. In fact, he also 
reverses the animal in such a manner as to put its menibra- 
niferous arms at the anterior part of the shell ; and manages, 
as he can, to explain how the animal holds its shell by the 
aid of suckers, which is difficult enough to conceive, since 
he says at the same time, that the arms are spread out upon 
the surface of the water. After these come Mr. Broderip, 
who affirms, that in a specimen which he had in his posses- 
sion, the palmated arms were on the side of the back of the 
shell; and Mr. James Sowerby, who nevertheless acknow- 
ledges that in Cranch's specimen it was the contrary. 

M. de Blainville has also had well-preserved specimens 
in his hands, and he has seen them turned in the manner we 
have described ; nevertheless, he draws from the divergence 
of opinions, another argument in favour of parasitism. This 
argument ought now to fail him, and indeed the inference 



12 M. SANDER RANG 

which he himself draws from it decides this question ; for it 
is very certain, that since the function of the membranes of 
the large arms consists in seizing the shell, by enveloping it 
from the re-entering part of the keel, to its further extremity, 
the animal must be constantly turned, so that this arrange- 
ment can take place, that is to say, it must have its dorsal 
part towards the spire. 

The partisans of parasitism place great stress upon an an- 
ecdote, which in fact would be very fit to decide the question, 
if it constituted an accurately made and precise observation, 
or even one worthy of confidence. We refer to the mollusc 
of which Rafinesque has made the genus Ocythoe. We 
know not if we are right, but it appears to us, that natural- 
ists, who have in some instances very just pretensions to 
having based their opinion upon scientific principles, de- 
ceive themselves in this instance, and take hold of a fact of 
no value, as we are about to show. The history of the genus 
Ocythoe is as follows. — 

A traveller, studying natural history in the Sicilian seas, 
found among other curious things, a cephalopod, of which 
this is the description, quoted, and no doubt verbatim, by 
M. de Blainville. " Tentacular appendages to the number of 
eight ; the two upper ones winged within ; with interior 
suckers; pedunculated; joined by the lateral wing; without 
any membrane at their base." If, as we cannot doubt, such 
is the description furnished by this naturalist, truly those who 
back themselves upon this clause to sustain their opinion are 
very fortunate, for never besides, according to what we know 
of the other poulps he has described, has this observer taken 
such great pains in describing a mollusc ; he does not speak 
of any shell; so that fact has been seized upon to show that 
the mollusc is the poulp of the argonaut, walking fieely in 
the open sea, and without its testaceous covering, as if the 
author usually took the pains to describe all that he sees in 
a mollusc — thus the parasitism is demonstrated ! 

To all this may we not make the following objections ? — 

1st. — It is not proved from this that the mollusc was 
without a shell, though Rafinesque says nothing of one. 

2nd. — It is not further proved, that in case the animal was, 
as we are willing to believe, without a shell, the shell had 
not been lost a few minutes before the capture of the animal : 
it is necessary, in order to reap advantage from this anecdote, 
that we should be well acquainted with all its details. 

3rd.— The astonishing descriptions of five or six poulps 
met with by the same traveller, and that taken from his Ocy- 
thoe, which are the only things that we have the honour of 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 13 

knowing about him, are not calculated to give to ourselves or 
others any confidence in the precision of his observations. 

4th. — We have not felt ourselves obliged to believe that 
this cephalopod was an argonaut-poulp, more especially be- 
cause his description states that the arms had no membrane 
at their base, and, as we have seen, although contrary to ob- 
servations made upon specimens preserved in alcohol, these 
molluscs possess, if not very large, yet, at least, very visible 
ones. 

5th. — If we wished to describe one of our " Poulpes a 
grandes membranes^'' of which Ferussac makes his V^liferes, 
and a species of which we shall introduce at the end of this 
memoir, we should choose very nearly the same expressions 
as M. Rafinesque, so much does his poulp resemble those of 
this division. 

6th. — An expression made use of by M. de Blainville him- 
self, shows of itself, all the uncertainty which prevails con- 
ceraing this mollusc. "There have been found," says this 
naturalist, " in the seas of Sicily, poulps, whose pair of up- 
per tentacula is spread out in width, probably as in the para- 
sitic poulps, since they appeared to differ sufficiently from 
known species to form a distinct genus, under the name of 
OcythoeP We shall just observe, that the veliferous poulps 
are common in the Mediterranean, and particularly in the 
seas of Sicily and Italy ^ and, that at the epoch when this 
traveller made his discovery, and even at that when M. de 
Blainville published his article, ' Poulpe du Dictionnaire,* 
no other species was known. 

It would be the same with the argument which it has been 
attempted to draw from the two poulps Ocythoe that Ranzani 
had in his possession : they were in alcohol, and one of them 
moreover carried the fragments of the shell. 

The partisans of parasitism bring forward yet another ar- 
gument, to which we believe it easy to reply, so as to make 
it valueless ; they say, that it is not always the same species 
of poulp that we find in the same species of shell. Their 
adversaries seek to demonstrate its non-parasitic nature, by 
sustaining, that it is always precisely the same. Which are 
we to believe ? As for ourselves, our opinion upon this sub- 
ject was formed long ago ; and we endeavoured to prove it 
in the ' Bulletin Universel des Sciences,' by citing an occa- 
sion when we had been able to examine a great number of 
these animals, some occupying the Argonauta Argo and others 
the rice-grained argonaut. We then easily convinced our- 
selves that the same species always inhabited the same shell ; 
for we never found in one those that we discovered in the 



14 M. SANDER RANG 

other. But- we will not argue from this fact ; for, following 
the example of M. de Blainville, we think that it is not well 
in any case, to support ourselves upon an observation capable 
of being set aside as being but a mere anecdote ; we will en- 
deavour to proceed by means of reasoning. 

M. de Blainville thinks, that it was an ordinary poulp that 
was seen by Aristotle in the shell of the argonaut ; and he 
founds his opinion upon what is said by that great naturalist 
of the xrms being united by a membrane, slender as a spi- 
der's web, in the same manner as the toes of ducks. Our 
ov\Ti observation of the palmatures upon the arms of the 
poulps of argonauts, of which we have already spoken, over- 
turns this argument, since it shows that the character ob- 
ser^^ed by Aristotle, applies as well to the one as the other. 

Mutien, Pliny, Bom, and Bosc, have all spoken of a Seiche 
which inhabits the argonaut ; that doubtless is true, but it is 
not less certain that these naturalists understood by a SeicJie, 
a poulp ; as is shown by the Sepia octopus of Linnaeus, the 
Sepia rugosa of Bosc, &c., &c. How otherwise are we to 
comprehend that a Seiche, which is always an elongated ani- 
mal, and not at all proteiform as poulps are in general, which 
besides,''encloses in its body a large, straight, and solid shell, 
could ensconce itself in the cavity of an argonaut, and conse- 
quently cause the first shell to accommodate itself to the form 
of the other. And further, to admit the possibility of so extra- 
ordinary a circumstance, we must suppose, (the narrowness of 
the opening in some argonauts considered), that the Seiche 
would place itself sideways, — that is, for example, the ventral 
part to the right, and the dorsal part to the left ; which would 
be contrary to what we have just pointed out as existing in 
the cephalopod of the argonaut, where the dorsal part is al- 
ways behind, and the ventral part always before, without a 
possibility of its ever being otherwise. 

M. de Blainville cites M. de Roissy, as having assured him 
that he had seen in the hands of M. Ferussac, in two different 
species of argonauts, the A. lisse, and the rice-grained argo- 
naut, two poulps, evidently of the same species. Here is, 
certainly, a very strong objection, and one which appears to 
carry much weight ; for M. de Roissy, as all naturalists know, 
is an observer as skilful as conscientious, and, for our own 
part, we often allow ourselves to be influenced by his judg- 
ment, because we have learned to know its worth ; but, wish- 
ing to have on this subject very accurate details, we interro- 
gated this naturalist, and, we confess, that the objection lost 
a great deal of its merit in our eyes, when we had learned 
from his own mouth that he had not seen the two poulps in 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 15 

question in the hands of M. Femssac, but merely drawings 
of them ! and that also these allowed some slight differences 
to be perceived, particularly in the colouring. 

Every one will agree with us, that, if this fact does not en- 
tirely lose its importance by this explanation, it is at least 
allowable to adjourn all conclusions with respect to it, and 
set it on one side. As to the rest, what inference of any 
importance can we draw thence, when we have shown that 
the premises are incorrect ? In fact, we can affirm positively, 
that the rice-grained argonaut has never been found in the 
Mediterranean, but chiefly upon the coasts of Brazil, at the 
Cape of Good Hope, and in the Indian ocean. 

What we have said of the position and use of the mem- 
braniferous arms of the poulp of the argonaut, will suffice, 
according to our view, to demonstrate that the same species 
of poulp cannot inhabit indifferently either species of shell. 
If it were otherwise, it would be in fact difficult to conceive 
how the upper arms and the membranes should be found to 
correspond in form and proportion with the lateral faces of 
the shells, which vary much according to their species. Thus 
we should be troubled to comprehend, how the poulp could 
maintain itself one day in the rice-grained argonaut, and ano- 
ther in the Argonauta Argo ; for, if its arms and membranes 
are just large enough to grasp the extent of the face of the 
former, they certainly would not be so for those of the latter. 
We declare further, that we have never found in the Argonauta 
Argo any but the species which we have sketched at the end 
of this memoir ; and we are obliged to add, that the intensely 
blue colouring which we have never failed to meet with up- 
on the large arms, gives us little confidence in the rather 
romantic pictures hitherto furnished. 

The discovery of the use of the palmated arms overturns 
some other hypotheses also, from which one or the other 
party drew more or less force ; and by this means it simpli- 
fies the question. 

Among such, is the assertion advanced by one naturalist, 
that the two large arms of the poulp arrange themselves in 
the interior of the shell, in such a manner that they cor- 
respond exactly to the two tuberculated edges of the keel, 
and that then the suckers form the tubercles ; — and also 
Ferussac's way of viewing it, who thought that the palmated 
part of the great te7ttacula rolled itself into a little globular 
mass, in the spiral cavity. 

Such is also this other opinion of M. Delle Chiaje, who 
thinks that it is by means of suckers that the animal trans- 
udes the calcareous matter, destined for the progressive in- 



16 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

crease of the shell ; and he finds proof of it in the supposed 
fact that the animal adheres to its shell only by these organs : 
an assertion also of this same naturalist, that the animal 
sees through his shell both his enemies and his prey; a cir- 
cumstance, which we confess appears to us difficult to credit, 
on account of the covering over of this shell by the mem- 
brane of the great arms, which must considerably diminish 
its already small degree of transparency ; and, finally, a 
description in which the same naturalist proclaims the fact, 
that when the poulp of the argonaut wishes to change its 
place, it overturns its shell, spreads out at the surface of the 
water its two membraniferous arms, as well as its pointed 
tentacula, so that there remains only its body in the shell, 
adhering to it only by means of some of the suckers nearest 
the base. It is now evident, that the palmated arms an- 
swer a purpose quite different to that of floaters.

Ascending the rising ground to the south of Ballinahinch, I 
found the view amply repay me for the trouble. Immediate- 
ly beyond the palace — the Martin is a king in Cunnemara, 
and his house a palace — rose that strange assemblage of hills 
called the Twelve Pins. In my endeavours to count these 
Pins, I was quite unsuccessful ; and the number appears to 
be optional on the part of the counter. Immediately around 
the palace, — a modem and by no means an elegant building, 
— water and wood are very prettily interspersed. It would 
add some fraction of interest, could I name the bold head- 
lands that jutted out into the more level bog, — the lakes that 
even there, mountain-locked though they were, reflected a 
bright blue sky, and fleeting clouds of surpassing white- 
ness, — and those lovely islands, covered with the richest, 
thickest, wood. How is it that throughout Cunnemara the 
lake-islands alone bear trees ; and that here they abound, of- 
ten to crowding ? I here observed the hen-harrier [Cercus 
cya7ieus), hunting over the bog, as owls fly along our fallows 
in quest of mice. The face was turned downwards, often 
however being moved in every direction. I fancied that these 
marauders were looking after the young curlews, which I am 
sure must be abundant, for the old ones would run before me 



NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORV. 17 

as I marched over the hills, and waken the echoes of the 
Twelve Pins with their piercing whistle. The curlews were 
evidently at enmity with the hawks, for sometimes two or 
three would follow a hawk, and attempt to stun him with their 
whistle ; when they apj)roached too near, the hawk would 
turn up his round face as if to take a survey, and then look 
down again, as if quite satisfied he had nothing to fear, and 
with noiseless wing beat the bog as regularly as a well-train- 
ed pointer. During the day I saw^ many of these hawks, but 
not one that I supposed to be the female of the same species. 
In the afternoon the clouds came down so low as to hide all 
the hills by whose forms I had endeavoured to steer, and 1 
was not sorry to see something like a road winding round the 
shore of a beautifully wooded lake. This lake, I afterwards 
learned, was Garromin, and the beautiful woods the property 
of a Mr. Mahon, the residence being called Glendalough. — 
Just beyond the lake is a cottage called the Recess, and a few 
cultivated fields, one of which was completely purple with 
the blossoms of Vicia Cracca. The grass was intended for 
mowing, and was not yet cut ; I think it would have averaged 
three feet in height, and was very close together ; the crop 
must have been enormous. There was a patch of oats that 
must have been nearly five feet high. From what T learned 
at Roundstone, I believe the land might be taken at sixpence 
or eightpence an acre unbroken, and where partially re- 
claimed, for 2s. or 2s. 6d. The plan is, " to set a plot of 
ground to a man," that is, to let him have a tract marked out 
from point to point, but not measured, and for this he is to pay 
an annual sum. I saw, above Roundstone, plots of about 
forty English acres, as nearly as I could guess, set at £^ a- 
year. But between Urrisbeg and the sea, is a wonderfully 
rich and populous tract, which is let in small pieces, and at 
a higher rate. I was told that in the immediate vicinity of 
Roundstone, under Urrisbeg, is a population of nine or ten 
thousand people ; and I was quite willing to credit it, for [ 
could have counted near upon a thousand cabins, and ten in- 
mates to a cabin is by no means an extraordinary number. — 
But this is going back. From " the Recess " I walked stea- 
dily along the road, in hopes of finding a place to stop at for 
the night, but the bog seemed to stretch out before me, and I 
began to anathematize the Irish miles. I felt a twinging in 
the shin-bone, which had annoyed me for seven or eight days, 
get so much worse that I could scarcely step with that leg 
without crying out. I had walked ten hours a-day, which 
would be thirty English miles, ever since I broke my shin in 
crossing Achill Sound, and it had day by day grown more

painful. I began to think the bone was splintered, and that 
I might perchance meet with an effectual stop, if I persisted 
in bearing up against it : so I made a halt, took off my knap- 
sack, and throwing it on a bed of Metiziesia, sat myself down 
and examined my wound. I did not like its appearance, and 
waited for chances. 

I sat for an hour, or rather perhaps lay, for I went to sleep ; 
and a party of police, who had been spending a night in 
Clifden, to superintend "a pattern" which had been going 
on there, happened to come by on their way to their quarters. 
They had a queer vehicle ; it was like a liondon brewer's dray 
in nakedness, but with this difference, that the wheels were 
under the bed of the vehicle, so that they could sit over the 
wheels and dangle their legs down, as in an outside car. Of 
course they gave me a lift, and deposited me safely at Flynn's 
half-way-house, — a wonderful place, and the residence of a 
whole colony of Flynns. I shall never forget the kindness of 
the people at this place : they made me an excellent fire|in 
my bed-room, brought in an enormous dinner, — a fowl killed 
on purpose, a pile of potatoes, eggs and bacon, beyond all 
possibility of consumption, bread and butter, and whiskey a 
discretion. The next morning I could not w^alk ; so I got a 
lift by Bianconi's car. Leaving Flynn's there is a most sweet 
lake — Lake Shindella — to the right, with such beautifully- 
wooded islands, it was like a land of enchantment. After 
Shindella was passed, there came a line of lakes along the 
road to the right, and finally these issued in a river, and this 
river still accompanied the road, but was so overshadowed by 
a fringe of huge Osmunda regalis, that the stream"was]often 
lost to sight, though its course was abundantly marked by this 
luxuriant fern. 

The road towards Galway is cut beside the river Feogh, a 
picturesque although small stream. It runs rapidly over lime- 
stone slabs, and similar slabs often overhang its waters, par- 
ticularly where it enters the village of Oughterard. Here, 
for many hundred yards, a beautiful skreen of the greenest ivy 
is suspended from the bank above, and actually dips its ex- 
tremities in the rushing river, forming caves and grottoes that 
naiads and water-nymphs might be proud to occupy. The 
stream falls over a succession of ledges, and just after pass- 
ing Oughterard, it flows under one huge slab of limestone, 
and is soon lost in the waters of Lough Corrib. The slab or 
mass of stone forms a natural bridge, over which passes the 
road to Galway. Here the country becomes more cultivated, 
and planting to a very great extent is going on. The face of 
the country is very curious, displaying the most wonderful

forms of craggy limestone that I have ever seen, and crowded 
with such ferns as delight in rocks. Ceierach officinarum 
and Asplenium Ruia-muraria and Trichomanes were in the 
greatest possible luxuriance. And here I should remark that 
I have never seen Ceierach so fine as in Ireland. Many of 
the larger ferns were also in great profusion : — Lastrcea Filix- 
mas, Las. dilatata, Athyrium Filix-foemina, and all the forms 
of Polystichum aculeatum, and Osmunda regalis, as usual. — 
Most of these ferns, but more particularly Ceierach, occurred 
on all the walls till I reached Galway. 

The walls and houses in Galway are half covered with 
Parietaria officinalis ; and being generally very old, and the 
Parietaria unusually fine, we might venture to call the old 
age of Galway " a green and vigorous old age. " Ceierach is 
abundant all round and even in the town. Mine host having 
detected me in the act of stowing away a iew fi-onds I had 
just been gathering, informed me of a botanist resident in the 
town, and assured me he would be glad to see me ; so in a 
few minutes I found myself in the presence of one of the 
most ardent and right-spirited naturalists with whom it has 
ever been my good luck to foregather. He gave me authen- 
tic specimens of Erica Mackaiana, and also Adianiuyn Ca- 
pillus- Veneris from the foot of Urrisbeg. 

Having now finished Cunnemara, I will just run over an 
enumeration of its ferns. Adianium Capillus- Veneris, rare; 
Lomaria spicant, abundant ; Pieris aquilina, very sparingly 
scattered ; Polypodlum vulgare, very local ; Cystopteris fra- 
gilis, local; Polystichufn aculeatum, abundant in some places 
and in all varieties ; of Lasircea Oreopteris I saw one plant 
only ; Las. Filix-mas, rare ; Las. dilatata, everywhere ; var. 
dumetorum, abundant; Athyrium Filix-foemina, abundant; 
Asplenimn Adiantum-nigrum, common on rocks ; Asp. Ruta 
muraria, on ruins; Asp. marinum, on cliffs by the sea; Asp, 
Trichomanes, on rocks and buildings, not uncommon ; Ceie- 
rach officinarum, abundant on walls ; Scolopendrium vulgare 
not common ; Hymenophyllum Tunhridgense and Wilsoni, 
on wet rocks, and intermixed ; Osmunda regalis, most abun- 
dant, sometimes covering small islands in the lakes. In pass- 
ing through the country as I did, and omitting altogether the 
Mam Turk range and the Twelve Pins, I must of course have 
missed many of the finest localities ; yet is this list a goodly 
one. 

I must now make a comment or two on those ferns which 
I either did not see at all, or saw but seldom. Polypodium 
Dryopteris and Phegopieris ; these species, in Scotland and 
Wales, abound in all districts similar to those which I hunted 



20 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

most diligently in Cunnemara, yet I never detected a single 
frond of either of them in the latter district. Lastrma Ore- 
opteris ; although I traversed large districts such as this fern 
usually delights in, yet I found it not. I suppose the climate 
is too warm for these three ferns, and that they may possibly 
occur at a greater elevation : but I should say that Polypo- 
dimn Dryopteris is exceedingly rare in Ireland, and with the 
exception of two fronds gathered by Mr. Moore on Knocklayd, 
Co. Antrim, I have neither seen nor heard of a single speci- 
men. Osmunda seems to have completely taken the place 
of Pteris, and Filix-foemina of Filix-mafi. 

It was with regret that I left Galway without having visit- 
ed the South Isles of Arran, but the lame leg was in the way, 
and moreover I was told it would be difficult to get away 
from them with the violent wind that was blowing off shore ; 
and much as I wished to see them, especially Arranmore, 
where Adiantum Capillus- Veneris is found in such profusion, 
I was compelled to give it up, and to patronise Bianconi. — 
And really, after all, it is a great comfort that you never can 
find yourself in any considerable town, without finding also 
one of Bianconi's cars ready to transport you elsewhere as 
soon as you please. As I was jolting along the bank of Gal- 
way Bay, the clouds were driven headlong to seaward, and 
the sun burst forth with bright but watery splendour. I 
gazed on the Isles of An*an, as they rose clearly from the sea 
against the blue horizon, and even then I was half tempted to 
turn back, but having passed Oranmore, the sea was lost, and 
I turned my thoughts inland. The country now assumed a 
very different aspect ; it appeared bleak, but was generally 
cultivated, and lets at fifteen or sixteen shillings per Irish 
acre. Close to the town of Galway the little paddocks for 
cattle let at £4. and £b. per Irish acre. Loughrea is a mi- 
serable place ; whole streets of houses are without roofs, and 
I felt tempted to enquire whether the plague or cholera had 
stripped them of their inhabitants. Passing the little village 
of Aughrim, where the decisive battle was fought between 
James and William, I reached the important and thriving 
town of Ballinasloe. There I got on board a boat just start- 
ing by the canal for Shannon Harbour ; it was drawn by three 
horses, a boy was on the first, and another on the third, and 
they set off at full gallop, the whips cracking, and the boys 
vociferating in the choicest Irish. 

At Shannon Harbour I stayed a night, and then went on 
board a steam-boat going down to Limerick ; it is a tedious 
passage. The steam-boat which took us to Portumna was 
a funny concern ; the funnel, boiler, pistons, &c., amidships,

and the paddle-wheels aft, and no wider than the deck. The 
locks and artificial cuts seemed endless ; it is called navigat- 
ing the Shannon, but you really navigate little canals, twelve 
or fifteen feet wide, for which the Shannon supplies the wa- 
ter. However, when we arrived at Portumna, a steamer of 
the usual build took us through Lough Derg, the scenery of 
which is certainly interesting, but can scarcely be called fine. 
This steamer took us to Killaloe, where a boat awaited us, 
which, with trotting or galloping horses, conveyed us through 
a perfect labyrinth of locks to Limerick. To compare the 
navigation of the Shannon with that of the Thames, is sheer 
nonsense. The Thames is a vast and deep tide-river, at all 
times navigable, but at high water capable of floating the 
largest ships ever built : the Shannon is wide, but so shallow 
in some places, and so rapid in others, that it never can be 
rendered of any mercantile importance. Limerick has in it a 
great deal to occupy the time and attention. It is divided 
into the new and old towns : the new town is very respecta- 
ble in its way, a sort of Pavement-Moorfields-looking place, 
and a long straight street, and the houses much of a same- 
ness ; but the old town, on the Clare side of the Shannon, 
took my fancy amazingly. I ascended the tower of its an- 
tiquated and mis-shapen Cathedral, and gathered Scolopen- 
driiim, and Ceterach, and Ruta-miiraria, fi"om its summit, 
and looked over that ancient town, which is known by the 
opprobrious epithet of " English.'''' 

I visited Castle Connell, a poor little village six Irish 
miles from Limerick, much frequented on account of the ap- 
pearance of the Shannon, which is here very shallow, and 
runs over a bed of stones. I crossed to the Clare side in a 
little boat, and the boatmen were very impressive in their 
conversation touching the danger of the passage (which they 
perform twenty times a-day), and told me the falls were con- 
sidered the finest in Europe, and that Mr. English (Inglis) 
had been there. On the Clare side are the grounds of Sir 
Hugh Massey, and the view of the river from the " hanging 
gardens " as they are termed, is very pretty : there is a con- 
stant ripple for half a mile. Having heard so much of Mr. 
Inglis at this place, I looked into his book, and find, after a 
page of grandiloquence, the following tvind up. — " None of 
the Welsh waterfalls, nor the Geisbach in Switzerland, can 
compare for a moment, in grandeur and effect, with the ra- 
pids of the Shannon." On the walls of the hanging gardens 
I saw abundance of Ceteracli^ Aspleniimi Ruta-muraria, 
Adiantum-7iigrum, and Trichomaiies, Scolopendrium vulga^ 
re, Lomaria spicant, and Polypodium vulgare. 



22 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

Having had my leg mended by a regular practitioner at 
Limerick, I determined to rest it another day, and so got on 
board a steamer bound for Kilrush. It was a glorious day, 
and the steamer ploughed the sea in gallant style. I call it 
sea, for though in courtesy called ^ the Shannon,' it is in fact 
all sea below Limerick. There is much to amuse the tourist 
in this picturesque estuary, but I panted for the mountains, 
and was tired of steam-boats. On approaching Kilrush, we 
obtain a view of Scattery Island, with its numerous ruins and 
lofty round tower. I did not go to the island, but was told 
that this round tower is perfectly solid — a compact mass of 
stonework from the base to the summit. If so, it differs abun- 
dantly from all other round towers, for they invariably have 
an internal cavity, apparently to allow of ascent within. 

The island is sacred to St. Senanus, who flourished here 
long before St. Patrick came into fame. The crabbed old 
saint indignantly refused to permit any woman to set foot in 
his territory. I believe it was Cannera, a saintess, conveyed 
thither on a raft by an angel, whose disappointment Moore 
deplores to the tune of * The Brown Thorn^ taking care, ra- 
ther wickedly, to add, how 

" legends liint that had the maid 

" Till morning's light delayed, 
" And giv'n the Saint one rosy smile, 
" She ne'er had left his lonely isle." 

Oh rare Tom Moore ! I heartily wished I could conjure up 
old Senanus from his long rest, not to enquire about Canne- 
ra, but simply to ask what the Scientific Associations, and 
sapient literati of his day, said about the round towers. It 
would be amusing to know at what conclusions they arrived, 
and to whom w^as then assigned the premium on round-tow- 
er-speculation. It is very obvious that in the earliest days of 
Christianity, when it is to be presumed the Irish were pos- 
sessed of more zeal than architectural skill, these towers were 
frequently built into their churches, and performed the office 
of heaven-pointing spires : but of so superior a structure were 
these spires, that even now, when the early churches have 
mended the roads, or are reduced to a confused and scattered 
heap of ruins, the towers stand triumphant and alone in their 
glory, sneering sarcastically at the feeble efforts of time. 

When I landed at Kilrush, I found all the steam-boat peo- 
ple were going to Kilkee, and I did the same, w^ithout any 
definite object. There were from thirty to fifty cars on the 
quay where we landed, and twelve of these were soon freight- 
ed with live lumber for Kilkee. We were a formidable body

altogether ; it must have been a gallant sight to a traveller 
moving in an opposite direction ! Whips cracking, carmen 
shouting, and the company laughing, talking, and smoking, 
and on terms of the most easy familiarity with each other. — 
On arriving at Kilkee there was a regular car-race to the best 
inn, and when that was glutted, to the second-best, and then 
to the third. 

When I arose the next morning T was located at a fashion- 
able bathing-place. I found it extremely difficult to make 
the Irish believe that T was such a fool as to wander over 
their island in search of plants or insects, or to see the coun- 
try. At Kilkee the folks were of a very respectable class, 
and evidently felt hurt at my explanations ; they thought I 
was "smoking " them, so T pleaded my leg as an excuse for 
coming to Kilkee, and this seemed perfectly rational ; and 
when I left the place about thirty-six hours after my arrival, 
they kindly hoped I had " found, the benefit." Up to this 
period I think I had been asked a hundred times my name, 
occupation in life, country, exact place of abode, the place I 
had last come from, the place T was next going to, the object 
of my journey, what I had in my knapsack, and at whose 
expense I travelled.

Art. IV. — On the London. Clay formation at Bracklesham Bay, 
Sussex. — By James S. Bowerbank, Esq., F.G.S., &c. 

There are few localities where the London Clay can be ex- 
amined, of which so little is known, and which at the same 
time is so worthy of a careful investigation, as that portion 
presented to our view by the action of the sea at Bracklesham 
Bay and its neighbourhood, on the coast of Sussex. The 
deposit here differs so much, both in its mineral character and 
fossil contents, from the same formation in other parts of Eng- 
land, and exhibits so close an approximation in both these 
respects to the corresponding beds in France — those of the 
Calcaire Grossier — as to render it a matter of surprise that it 
has not attracted a greater share of the attention of English 
geologists. 

The low clay cliffs extending from Selsea Bill to the mouth 
of Chichester Harbour, seldom exceed ten or twelve feet in 
height, and for by far the greater part of the space interven- 
ing between these points, do not rise higher than six or seven 
feet. This section presents the usual characteristic appear- 



24 . ON THE LONDON CLAY FORMATION 

ance of the London clay, — dark brown or blueish clay, with 
rarely any fossil remains. The base of this low cliff is usu- 
ally covered up with shingle, which extends towards the low 
water mark for about fifteen or twenty yards, and there it ter- 
minates. The remaining space intervening between the foot 
of the shingle bed and low water mark, is in many places at 
least 80 or 100 yards in length, and presents a surface, under 
ordinary circumstances, of a clean, dark greyish-green sand, 
with scarcely a single pebble to be seen : but after some 
tides it is literally strewed with thousands of the detached 
valves of Venericardia planicostay and of other shells, while 
at other times scarcely a shell can be found. The part of the 
bay most interesting to the geologist, is that immediately in 
the neighbourhood of Bracklesham Bam, especially at about 
a furlong to the east of that spot, where there is a small 
break or chine in the low clay cliff. At this place, and at a 
few paces east and west of it, beneath about six or seven feet 
of clay, there is a stratum of light green marly sand, abound- 
ing in remains of Venericardia planicosta and other shells, 
but which is frequently entirely hidden by thrown-up shingle, 
and it is very rarely that more than a few feet in length of 
this bed can be seen. It is from this bed, or from one ex- 
ceedingly like it, somewhat lower in the series, that perhaps 
most of the interesting shells of this -district are to be pro- 
cured. If we proceed from this little break or chine west- 
ward, for about forty paces parallel to the coast, and then in 
the direction of a line at a right angle to the cliff, and at the 
time of low water, we shall find, near the low- water-mark, 
the bed we have described as abounding in fossils, exposed 
by the action of the sea in the most favourable manner. At 
this spot Venericardia planicosta is found literally by thou- 
sands, with the valves united, the shells resting -upon their 
edges, and packed close to each other, exactly in the manner 
that we might expect to have found them, supposing them to 
have been recent shells with the animals yet inhabiting 4^em. 
Comparatively very few are gaping, and their condition and 
position strikingly impress upon the mind the idea that when 
alive, they must have inhabited the spot from which they are 
now disinterred ; especially as there are numerous small and 
fragile species of other well-known London-clay shells, which 
could not have remained whole had they been subjected to 
much attrition amid the larger shells suiTOunding them. On 
the sands in the vicinity of this spot I found large masses of 
Nummularia laevigata cemented together, and numerous de- 
tached specimens of the same shell. 

At the eastern extremity of this bed, which, at the time of 



AT BRACKLESHAM BAY, SUSSEX. 25 

my visit, was opened for about fifty yards, I found Sanyuin- 
olaria Hollowasii, a rare and fragile, but very beautiful shell, 
in a fine state of preservation. At about twenty or thirty 
yards westward of the western end of this interesting patch of 
shells there are large blocks of this bed, which, being of a 
firmer texture than the surrounding parts of the deposit, have 
suffered less from the action of the water, and project about 
twelve or eighteen inches above the surrounding sand, and, 
by presenting an obstruction to the ebbing tide, they usually 
induce the formation of a small pool amidst which they 
stand. At the south-eastern side of this pool, on one occa- 
sion I found the stratum, which is usually covered by the 
sand, completely exposed. At this spot there was scarcely 
a specimen of Venericardia planicosta to be seen, but in- 
stead of this shell, Tiirritella conoidea and edita were em- 
bedded in a dark green marly sand ; and among them, toge- 
ther with Fusus longcRVus, and other well-known London- 
clay shells, I found Veiiericardia acuiicostata and mitis, and 
a splendid specimen of Conus deperditus, fully equal in size 
to the one figured by Deshayes. Westward of this point I 
did not meet with anything particularly interesting. 

Proceeding eastward from this locality, I found, at about 
midway between high and low water mark, Cerithlum Cornu- 
copicB, a Corhula, which I believe to be Corb. gallica, Cythe- 
rea trigonula and sulcatarea^ and a new species which I 
cannot find in Deshayes' work ; and also Area duplicata and 
a new species of Crassatella. 

About midway betw^een Bracklesham bam and the Thomey 
coast-guard station a series of patches of a deposit of chalk- 
flints was exposed : the first of these was nearly at low water 
mark, and the remainder of them ran, at short distances from 
each other, in a diagonal line towards the coast, nearly in the 
direction of a straight line drawn from their western extremity 
to the Thomey station houses. Apparently, this stratum of 
flints has not, at any time, exceeded eight inches or a foot in 
thickness, they are indeed so thinly scattered as rarely to oc- 
cur piled upon each other : very few of them have suffered 
from attrition, and the greater part retain their original form 
and whitened surface. They are firmly embedded in the same 
light green marly sand, which I before described as occurring 
at the bottom of the London clay, in the neighbourhood of 
the little chine near Bracklesham bam. Amongst the flints 
there are numerous remains of the roots of trees, in the state 
of soft bog-wood; which indicate that this portion of the 
strata has been very thinly covered by the superimposed clay.

26 ON THE LONDON CLAY FORMATION 

Upon one of the bouldered flints, firmly embedded in the 
marly sand, I found the most interesting of the valuable series 
of fossils which I had the good fortune to obtain during this 
excursion, namely, a fine specimen of Asti'ca, built upon the 
upper and exposed surface of a flint. The base of the coral 
is three and a quarter inches long and two and a quarter wide, 
and closely embraces and spreads over the rounded edge of 
the smooth stone. No part of the coral appears to have suf- 
fered from attrition : it is three and a half inches in height 
from the base to its upper surface, from which a considerable 
portion has been broken off", and the fractured surface presents 
every appearance of having suff'ered no other injury than that 
arising from the action of the water since it was exposed. I 
have carefully examined, with a high microscopic power, thin 
sections of the stone on which this interesting coral is built, 
and can safely assert that it is truly a chalk-flint, as it exhi- 
bits the characteristic organic structure of the Kentish chalk- 
flints, and abounds with the well-known forms of the foramen- 
iferous shells of the chalk. On the following day I obtained 
from one of the coast-guard, a second but smaller specimen 
of the same coral, which had been picked up close to the spot 
where mine was procured. This has been drawn by Mr. J. 
DeC. Sowerby, and engraved to accompany the present paper. 

Astrea is completely a tropical genus ; but when we consi- 
der the many other tropical forms occurring in the same for- 
mation, such as those abounding among the fruits, the remains 
of saurians and fresh-water turtles, and also that Astrea has 
been found in the lower beds of the calcalre grossier, we shall 
not be surprised at its occurrence in beds which, according 
to the description of Mr. Webster, are so closely allied to 
those of the calcaire grossie7' of Liancourt, both as regards 
their mineral character and their fossil contents. 

Near the Thorny coast-guard station Cerithmm Cornuco- 
pi(B and giganteiim, Turritella sulcifera (Melania sulcata of 
Sowerby), Ttir. terehellata and multisulcata, are found, al- 
though I could not ascertain the beds from which they come, 
but their position is probably lower in the series than those 
which occur to the westward of Brackelsham barn. Sower- 
by, in the description of Melania sulcata in the ' Mineral 
Conchology,' states that at Stubbington, where the specimen 
/igured was found, " the cliff" is twenty or thirty feet high, 
composed of sand and gravel, more or less mixed with blue 
mud, and frequently irregular patches of sand. At the base of 
this is a stratum, not more than two feet thick, of blue clay 
or mud, in which the shells are found.'*

Five or six species of Astrea nearly resembling this are found 
at Hauteville, and other places in La Manche, where Ceri- 
thium Cornucopue abounds. The existence of this Astrea at 
Brackelsham Bay is therefore another link between the Lon- 
don clay of Hampshire, and the tertiary beds of France, and 
would indicate a temperature progressively higher in that di- 
rection, when the beings, the remains of which w^e now find, 
were living. May we not hope that an assemblage of such 
indications may hereafter show if any, and what, changes 
have taken place in the position of the equator since the de- 
position of these strata }

28 SPONTANEOUS GENERATION OF PLANTS 



Art. V. — On the Flora of Snow Formations, in reference to the 
theory of Spontaneous Generation. By W. VVeissenbobn, 

Although the recent discoveries of Professor Ehrenberg 
appear little favourable to the casual production of organic 
beings at the present period, yet they do not in the least 
affect the theory, that their original existence is owing to a 
purely dynamic process. The importance of this subject will 
perhaps excuse me if I try, in this place, to lessen the weight 
of the above conclusion,^ by some reflections (founded on 
facts to which I have not alluded in my former articles on this 
question) on certain spontaneous generations which are un- 
doubtedly going on in our time, and which, in calling the at- 
tention of the reader to the traces of a nascent future creation, 
may serve to throw some light on the conditions of the former 
and present ones, as well as to banish the uncouth idea of a 
Deus ex machina. 

Although it would appear from the calculations of M. Fou- 
rier, as applied by M. Arago (Annu. du Bur. de Long. 1834), 
that the general temperature of the globe has not changed by 
-j^ of a degree centig. within the last 2000 years, yet, accord- 
ing to the theory of cosmogony now universally admitted, the 
body which shall next add a new crust to the solid part of our 
planet must be water, in the various modifications of structure 
which it presents under the forms of ice and snow. What 
proportion of the existing quantity of it w ill be required and 
consumed in completely oxidizing and cicatrizing the actual 
mineral crust, it is impossible to determine ; but leaving the 
vapoury part of it out of the question, and supposing the mean 
depth of the ocean to be only four miles (the calculations of 
Laplace make it from four to five), and its extent about three 
fourths of the surface of the globe ; then supposing the mean 
density of the solid and lasting products of water, from the 
hardest ice to the lightest snow, to be half that of water, the 
thickness of the strata that will be added to the globe by the 
solidification of the water existing on the surface of our pla- 
net will be six miles. Were the bed of the ocean to remain 
in its present state, the present mineral crust of the globe 
would be covered only three miles high, reasoning from the 
present level of the sea ; but as that bed is constantly filling 
up, the distribution of the crust of ice and snow over the whole

surface of the globe, will be considerably more equable than 
might be otherwise anticipated. 

Now we must suppose that long before the whole of this 
vast geological formation shall be added to the surface of the 
globe, the whole of the living creation strictly belonging to 
the present crust must have become extinct, and their remains 
imbedded and partly preserved in snow and ice, as their ex- 
istence is incompatible with a ground composed (chiefly) of 
snow and ice, as well as with a perfectly dry atmosphere. 

Let us not, however, conclude, that this new surface will 
present a dreary aspect, or be void of vegetable and animal 
life. Diuing the gradual transition from the present state of 
things to the succeeding one, it cannot be doubted that many 
organisms will arise which will link the succeeding creation 
to the former ; and though in the present state of the surface 
the geographical distribution of the species of the same fami- 
lies appears to prove that the complication and perfection of 
structure depends greatly on the quantity of free caloric pre- 
sent, yet we have no right to conclude that under circumstan- 
ces entirely changed, the comparative absence of that element 
from the ground must render the new creation comparatively 
scanty and imperfect. Nay, there are many reasons which 
would seem to support an opposite conclusion. 

For proofs of this new creation we have to look to the poles 
and the tops of the alpine mountains, where the geological 
formation of ice and snow has already fairly begun. The 
Flora of these regions is, as yet, very poor; but we have to 
consider that it is in an incipient state. On the Alps grow 
two species, the red snow [Protococcns or Palmella nivalis), 
and a very curious production which M. Hugi found only on 
the glacier of the Unteraar, but which is said also to occur 
on that of Chamouni, a description of which I shall give be- 
low. To the snow-flora of the Poles, consisting likewise of 
the red snow, the expedition of the Recherche to Spitzbergen 
has lately added (as stated in a letter from Dr. Robert to 
Baron Struve, the Russian minister in Hamburgh) a second 
species of red snow, and a delicate green flabelliform plant, 
two inches in height. Now we have only to notice the pe- 
culiar circumstances under which these plants are foimd, in 
order to be convinced that they are the specific and sponta- 
neous productions of a soil that is neither "land" nor "seas," 
and to render it probable that from every new and well-esta- 
blished stratum there will spring a new creation at any time. 

As the polar regions are comparatively unknown, and have 
never been visited by man within about ten degrees of lati- 
tude from the north pole, these phenomena have only been 



30 SPONTANEOUS GENERATION OF PLANTS 

well studied on hij^^h mountains, especially the Alps of Swit- 
zerland, where besides, every modification of lasting ice and 
snow is comprised within a narrow range that may be survey- 
ed with comparative facility. 

From the foot of the glaciers to the highest tops of the 
mountains, the ice and snow present a constant change of stra- 
tification and structure. Below, the strata average eight feet 
in thickness, and the ice-crystals are often two inches in di- 
ameter. On the summit of the glaciers the thickness of the 
strata is at most two feet, and sometimes only six inches, and 
the crystals having become gradually smaller on the limit of 
the glacier, pass into that sort of granulated snow which in 
Switzerland is called Firn. The appearance of this fim marks 
the limit of a very important change in the meteorological 
conditions. Whilst the height at which the glaciers begin, 
as well as the line of perpetual snow, varies in Switzerland 
from 6,000 to 10,000 feet, according to the exposure, the firn- 
line, at about 8,000 feet, appears to be comparatively inde- 
pendent of temperature. At the height of from 10,000 to 
12,000 feet above the sea, M. Hugi sometimes observed a heat 
of from -f 15° to -f20° R. (the thermometer being probably 
exposed to the direct rays of the sun), but no melting of the 
snow, as is remarked below the firn-line at much lower tem- 
peratures; (see Hugi's Naturhistorische Alpenreise). At such 
high temperatures M. Hugi saw the fresh-falling snow losing 
its needles or rays, and converting itself into grains, so as to 
constitute Jlrn, whilst the old firn became loosened to the 
depth of several feet, so as to resemble a heap of hemp-seed. 

The Palmella nivalis is found exclusively on the firn, be- 
ginning at the fim-line and ending about 1,000 feet above it. 
It is never seen either on a glacier or common snow ; its fa- 
vourite habitat being sunny slopes where the snow is quickly 
changed into firn. In August it is already blackish and de- 
caying at the firn-line, in full growth at 8,200 feet, and just 
springing at 9,000 feet. It is interesting to find that not on- 
ly is the existence of the plant strictly dependent on that of 
fim, but that the form of the former bears an evident relation 
to the structure of the latter. The little plant, in its nascent 
state, has the form of the letter Y, the simple radicle descend- 
ing between two grains of the second layer, and the two little 
branches embracing one grain of the surface-layer of the firn. 
In its incipient state it tinges the firn with a delicate rose co- 
lour, which is not observable when the eye is brought to the 
same level as the surface of the fim ; but when fully develop- 
ed, the plant appears above the surface of the firn, which is 
then beautifully crimson-coloured. The Palmella afterwards 



ON THE SURFACE OF ICE AND SNOW. 31 

becomes dingy, and at last black, decaying into mould which 
sinks into the iirn. 

The second plant of the snow-formation, which M. Hugi 
discovered, is never found on the firn or common snow, but 
grows out of the solid ice of the glacier of the Unteraar. The 
circumstances under which it is produced, and the plant it- 
self, are described by M. Hugi as follows. 

It is well known that all snow melts away from that gla- 
cier (as well as others) every year; and a certain portion of 
the surface of the glacier of the Unteraar is afterwards seen 
studded with innumerable holes, from one to six inches wide 
and from three to twenty inches deep, the bottom of each be- 
ing filled with black mould. In the neighbourhood of still 
existing snow-patches near the north-easterly side of the gla- 
cier, M. Hugi found these holes as yet very shallow, and a 
substance, more like jelly than mould, was still adhering to 
the surface. Soon after he also observed on the very borders 
of the snow-patches, while yet at some distance, spots of a 
bright yellow colour, which he found to be substances nearly 
the size of the hand, and an inch thick, very delicate and 
spongy, the under surface of which was strongly attached to 
the glacier, but they were unfortunately already in a state of 
decomposition. If he removed them, they melted into a co- 
lourless water, leaving his hands stained with an ochraceous 
substance. It was only in one spot that he found a well-pre- 
ser\^ed specimen of this plant. He cut out the part of the 
glacier on which it was growing ; the ice was perfectly pure 
and transparent, the plant was about the size of a hand, and 
half an inch thick, and presented ill-defined hemispherical 
protuberances and almost the appearance of a Tremella, but 
had so little cohesion that every part, when touched, crum- 
bled, or rather melted, away. The whole appeared like a 
beautifully bright yellow excrescence of the glacier, studded 
with bubbles, and melting into a water of the same yellow 
colour ; whereas in the older and decayed plants, the colour- 
ing principle had already been precipitated. This produc- 
tion was sunk between the crystals of the glacier, into which 
it had struck innumerable capillary radicles. The line of se- 
paration between the ice and the growth could nowhere be 
distinctly made out, nor could any peculiar organization be 
discovered in the latter, even with the assistance of a lens. 

We see, therefore, that the power of vegetation is inherent 
even to snow and ice, and that by creating organized beings, 
which decay, they lay the foundation for the existence of be- 
ings of a higher order. 

As to the production oi animal life on the snow-formation, 



32 ON SOME SPECIES OF ASTEKIAS 

we cannot expect to find living proofs of it in the present in- 
cipient stage of the formation itself. In the mean time the 
existence of creatures, as the Podura nivalis, which are ma- 
tured by the influence of snow, and can only enjoy their lives 
on that substance, will justify the conclusion that a continu- 
ous surface, formed chiefly of ice and snow, does not exclude 
animal life. 

But if we must admit the Flora of the snow-formation to 
exist by dint of spontaneous generation, it is but rational to 
conclude that the higher creatures, to whose puiposes that 
Flora will, without doubt, be at some time subservient, will 
not be created by direct supernatural intervention ; and al- 
though it may never be given to man to point out clearly Jww 
the natural powers, through which the Almighty manifests 
Himself to him, have operated or shall operate in creating 
animals, yet any unprejudiced mind may clearly discern that 
by cutting the knot in the customary manner, we can never 
hope to arrive at anything like a fair solution of the question.

Art. VI. — Remarks on some species of Asterias ybwwc? in Cornwall. 
By Jonathan Couch, Esq., F.L.S., &c. 

I HAVE the pleasure of forwarding for insertion in the Maga- 
zine of Natural History, a notice of some of the less known 
species of British star-fish, of the first of which Dr. Fleming 
complains of the want of a figure and description. These 
might have been supplied before now, if naturalists, living in 
some of our larger ports, where the trawl-fishery is chiefly 
followed, had examined the various matters torn from the bot- 
tom by that mode of fishing. I have no opportunities of this 
sort, and am chiefly indebted to accident for the possession 
of the specimen here described. 

Prickly Star-fish. Asterias spinosa. Flem. Br. An. p. 487. 

The diameter of this specimen, across the disk and rays, 
was thirty-three inches ; but the five rays were not of equal 
length, the longest being fourteen inches. Across the disk, 
in one direction, the diameter was three and a half inches, in 
another, three inches ; the disk depressed, although this may 
be only casual. The rays, at their origin, were two inches 
wide, tapering, depressed, flaccid ; their spines stout, and 
each surrounded by a tuft of fine suckers. Two of the rays 
have a double row of spines along the middle, divided by a

slight depression ; on the other rays only one row of spines, 
which are irregularly scattered. There is also a marginal 
row pointing obliquely downwards and forwards. The co- 
lour above, reddish brown ; tufts round the spines yellow. — 
Interior of the stomach pale green, and surrounded by eleven 
teeth. This species bears a greater resemblance to Asterias 
glacialis than to any other known to me ; but besides its su- 
perior size, it differs in having the rays less tapering and more 
flaccid. The proportion of the rays to the disk is also differ- 
ent ; for whilst in Ast. glacialis they are as two to one, in the 
species under consideration, on the under surface, where they 
are best defined, the breadth of the disk is to the length of the 
ray as two and a half to twelve. The individual spines are, 
indeed, not much unlike those of Ast. glacialis ^ but their dis- 
tribution, and consequently the figure of the body, are differ- 
ent. The spines on the disk are smaller than those on the 
rays. The weight of the body cannot be sustained, or even 
turned over, by lifting it by the rays, without separating them. 
The specimen came from deep water. 

It must be allowed that on comparing this description with 
the figure of a portion of a ray of Asterias spi)wsa in Borlase's 
Natural History of Cornwall, plate 25, fig. 18, the resemblance 
is not exact ; and I have no opportunity of referring to other 
original authority. If, therefore, any learned naturalist shall 
dispute the appropriation of the name, I give it up, on the 
condition that a more coiTect reference be given. 

The difficulty of doing this, however, will be somewhat ap- 
preciated by referring to the present state of our knowledge 
of some other species, which is far from satisfactory. Thus, 
in the Mag. Nat. Hist., o. s., vol. ix, page 145, the references 
are made on the supposition that two species have been con- 
founded; one of which is studded with produced spines, while 
the other, strictly speaking, has none, — the moveable, leg-like 
crutches not being regarded as such. It is true, the species 
above described cannot have been known to Dr. Johnston ; 
for he represents his Ast. rubens, of the length of twenty inch- 
es, as being superior in size to any other British species. — 
But the Doctor, who probably is as competent to settle the 
synonymes of the British Asteriadw, as any naturalist in the 
kingdom, is in error when he judges it to be the same as that 
which he has represented at page 145 of the same volume; 
and which also is different from that which I understand to 
be signified by the name of Ast. rubens. The latter, as shown 
in Pennant's Brit. ZooL, vol. iv., plate 30, fig. 58, ed. 1757, 
closely resembles a species familiarly known in Cornwall, 
which does not commonly exceed the size given in. the plate.

although a few may be found of twice that magnitude. I 
must therefore refer to Pennant's Ast. hisplda as different from 
the Ast. spinosa described above, as well as from the species 
given by Dr. Johnston under the name of Ast. rubens, the 
figure of which, though slight, is characteristic of one, a 
description of which I subjoin, as it will supply a few parti- 
culars not contained in Dr. Johnston's account. 

The diameter of the specimen was eighteen inches, to the 
extremity of the opposite rays ; of the disk, two inches and 
three quarters ; below, the proportion of the diameter of the 
disk to the length of a ray, as one to two and three quarters ; 
the disk flat ; rays seven, thin and tapering ; breadth of the 
ray where widest, one and three-tenths of an inch. Skin 
coriaceous ; on the disk minute spines, several from one base ; 
those on the rays somewhat larger, but less thickly set ; along 
the margin of the rays a double row, larger and more elevated 
than the others. Leg-spines three lines long ; suckers be- 
neath, in two rows, stout. Rays exceedingly frangible ; two 
that were broken off, flaccid, especially at the points ; one 
remaining uninjured, rigid at the tip. Colour reddish orange. 
In its stomach a purple Spatangus, crushed together. 

I the more despair of finding a proper synonym for this 
species, that Dr. Johnston has failed in it ; but, as some de- 
signation is indispensable, I have named it Ast. pectinata, 
from the minute points which crown the ossicula, and which 
become distinctly visible only when dry. 

I shall conclude these remarks by the description of a mon- 
strosity in the common species, — Ast. glacialis, the clam or 
cramp. It is of the ordinary size, and possesses eight rays ; 
but to distinguish it from the simple duplication of parts, it 
possesses three of those circular dorsal organs, the use of 
which is uncertain, but of which a common specimen pos- 
sesses only one. These three occupy triangularly, one half 
of the disk, and seem connected with four of the rays, the 
other four lying distinct from them. 

This s]3ecies is in great abundance in spring, being found 
in multitudes in the fishermens' crab-pots, the baits of which 
they readily find. As the season becomes warmer they dis- 
appear, and in summer comparatively few are to be seen.

ON THE MONKEYS KNOWN TO THE CHINESE. 35 



Art. VII. — On the Monkeys known to the Chinese, from the Native 
Authorities. By Samuel Birch, Esq., Assistant in the Depart- 
ment of Antiquities, British Museum ; Assistant Secretary for the 
English Section of the Archaeological Institute of Rome. 
( Continued from page 592, vol. 3j. 

Leaving the animals approximating nearest to man in Chi 
nese Natmal History, a secondary kind of baboons or apes 
appears in the Encyclopedia. Of these the Pei, the Hwatso, 
the Pih yuen, and others, are not very discernable with re- 
gard to species, although their general appearance is suffi- 
ciently accurate to identify the genera to which they appertain. 
The Pih yuen is apparently a Hylohates or Machacus ursinus, 
and its name implies "a white monkey." The ^San tsae' ob- 
serves, — " There are in the Tsang ting hills many Pih yuen; 
their outward appearance is similar to a Me how. They have 
large and uneven arms and legs, taking long steps, and are 
excellent climbers of trees ; their note is mournful." — San. 
Zool. iv. 41. The Pe or Pei is perhaps the Siamang ; it is 
figured erect, is described as " like a wild boar, with white 
stripes, long neck, and tall legs. It stands erect like man, 
is fierce, stupid, and excessively powerful. It tears up trees 
and delights in injuring mankind." — San &c. Zo. iv. 19. This 
animal is not described or drawn in the Japanese Encyclope- 
dia. The Mashe (horse-hog) is fabulous from its description, 
viz. " that in the Fow yii hills are quadrupeds whose exterior 
form is like that of an ape with four ears, tiger's hair, and a 
cow's tail. Their cry is a loud bark. They are designated Ala 
she and eat men. When seen it is a sign of plenty of water." 
This, if real, is the Machacus leoninus. Likewise the animal 
in Zool. iv. p. 30, where the description states that " in the 
Yuho kingdom are beasts whose body is of a black colour. 
Fire issues from their mouths. Their appearance is like a 
Mehow. They walk and sit like men." — Zool. iv. 30. This 
is either a Hylohates or Simla Lar. 

The Pih heaou (white bawler) is an edible animal. The 
San tsae &c. fixes it to the Lun tseen hills. "In the Lun tseen 
hills are beasts like apes, with long arms. They are fit for 
killing, and called Pih heaou." — San tsae, &c. Zool. iv. 34. 
The Papio Maimon is figured under the name of Tao teih or 
glutton, and a most ludicrous mistake has been made by the 
describers ; for since the eyes of the Papio, especially of the 
adult animal, are excessively small, they have accordingly 
been figured and described in the nipples of the animal ! — 
"The gluttons" says the text "have a goat's body, with human

face, eyes under their breast, tigers' teeth, and human nails. 
Their cry is like the squalling of children ; they eat men as 
well as other things. They are found in the Kewyu hills. — 
The * Book of Hills and Streams ' calls them Keuhaou." — Zo. 
iv. 39. 

The Tung [Simla callitrix) is another type that can be 
identified. They are described as "belonging to the Yuen 
yew species, being nimble in their movements, and excellent 
climbers of trees : both great and small kinds have the long 
tails of the Yuen, but of a golden colour, and are commonly 
called Kin-tseen Jung (golden thread Jung ). They are bred 
in the Laeshin hills. Men shoot and kill them with poisoned 
arrows. Their tails are made into bed-clothes, saddle-hous- 
ings, and rugs to lie upon. The Jung are vastly fond of their 
tails, but when struck with the poison gnaw them off through 
pain, to get rid of their calamity." The Hwatso is a fabulous 
animal, and consequently an object of superstition. " In the 
Yaoukwang hills are animals whose exterior appearance is 
like a Mehow, with human face and hogs' bristles. During 
the winter they dwell in caves. They are called Hwatso : 
their cry is like cut water, and when seen they are ominous 
of a conscription." The " cut water " probably refers to the 
noise of a mill. The expression " yaon yih " in the text, ap- 
pears to imply the power that the Chinese, in common with 
other despotic Asiatic governments, have of forcing people to 
work for them. Yih is literally " police runners to send out" 
&c. — Zool. iv. 

" The Yew are like the Mehow, and of a deep yellow and 
black colour ; their tails are several cubits long, like an ot- 
ter's, but have no tufts. When they scent the dew ascending 
to form rain, they then suspend themselves from a tree by 
means of their tails, to fill their nostrils with it, or else by both 
feet. In Keangtung they call them carriers, (Wuhkeen).'.' — 
Zool. iv. 38. 

The Gaou are said to inhabit the Lunseen hills, to be like 
an ape, with long arms, to be good for killing, and called Gaou. 
— Zool. iv. 34. " The Yuen's arms, when cut through at the 
thick part, can be made into flutes rounder than reeds ; they 
are of the monkey tribe, having long legs, and are good whis- 
tlers, given to dragging things about, whence their name is 
derived from the character yuen, to drag or lead. — Zool. iv. 36. 

" The Jen are like the common monkey (how), with green 
body and dark jaws, they have black whiskers: their paws 
are also black. They are naturally very fond of their whis- 
kers, and dote on their species, living and dying together ; 
on which account if one can be got at a hundred may be kill-

ed. Men shoot them with poisoned arrows ; the shot animals' 
companions draw out the arrow in order to wound themselves, 
and die with one another." They are also called Kwojen ; 
vide Morrison, (Diet. Chin, and Engl., part ii. vol. i. p. 321. 
4to. Macao). 

The How monkey (Simla) is one name for five sorts, viz.. 
How, Nao, Keo, Yu, and Muh. The female monkey is 
called 'Moo how not pin. The name of the Muh (washers) 
is derived from their habits : " they are naturally addicted to 
running about, fond of stealing things and utensils, and of 
imitating men, and as soon as they have brought forth their 
young, in imitation of mankind, they plunge them into the 
mountain streams." — Zool. iv. The how is the proper mon- 
key, but no plates being given of the others, it is difficult to 
guess which are indicated. 

This closes the account of the Simice in the ' San tsae too 
hwuy : ' many of the animals are fabulous, some few perhaps 
new. The following scattered notices have been collected 
from other sources, to throw as much light on the subject as 
limited time and materials will allow. Although Zoology as 
a science, may not receive much additional information from 
Chinese works, yet animals of new species may occasionally 
be found, as was the case of the tapir first described from the 
Chinese by Mr. Abel Remusat, the existence of which has 
since been satisfactorily proved. The Japanese Encyclope- 
dia before quoted, only presents its readers with two sorts of 
monkeys — the Yuen or Yuen-how, and the How, also named 
Hoosun. Fan ming mo sze cha, — " The name of Fan pro- 
vokes their irritability." " The keo are like monkeys, and fond 
of seizing in their paws men's property." Fan is the name of 
an Indian bonze. (See Heuen &c. part xii. p. 5). 

The Urhya, of which a very splendid copy in 4to., an edi- 
tion of the sixth year of the emperor Keaking, exists in the 
library of the British Museum, not only contains several draw- 
ings with explanations, but also an account of the Yu, or 'do- 
mesticated class,' with a commentary. The plates have the 
Fuh-fuh holding a sword, and said to be " like a man, with 
straggling hair, and to run after men to eat them." — Urh-ya,

38 SILICEOUS CASTS OF ECHINITES 

The " Keo foo, remarkable for their steady gaze; " and in 
their description in a consecutive page it is stated, that " the 
Keo are like a large Mehow, that their general colour is of a 
blueish black, and that when they meet men, they are fond of 
looking favourably upon them." In commentary upon the 
Keu they are described as " located in the Keen ping hills, be- 
ing about the size of a dog, and like a Mehow, having much 
whisker and hair on the top of their head, which they are fond 
of brushing, and that when they meet men they pick up stones 
and throw at them." In the Dictionary of P. Basil the Keo 
are described as a species of monkey like men, which ravish 
women. In comment upon the Nao it is stated that " their 
external appearance is like a luy, but smaller ; that they are 
of a brownish black colour, can be domesticated, are more 
agile than cats in catching mice, and that Kewshih says that 
the Nao only come from the south, and are of the Mehow 
baboon species." 

This finishes the monkeys in the works above cited. In 
the Chinese Dictionary of P. Basil, published by De Guignes, 
folio, Paris, 1807, the following apes are mentioned. 

The "Kea,^ sort of ape like a man." The Tsoo. The

Art. VIII. — On the Siliceous Casts of the 'Echinites from the Chalk. 
By Edward Charlesworth, F.G.S., &c. 

Some curious facts have, at various times, fallen under my 
notice, explanatory of the anomalous appearances often pre- 
sented by the siliceous casts of the Echini from the chalk, 
more especially the genera Ananchytes and Conulus ; and 
bearing also upon the history of the occasional silicification 
of the shell itself. Were it not for the costly nature of the 
engravings necessary to illustrate the subject, I should have 
been tempted ere this, in some shape or other, to have placed 
my observations on record ; and, without losing sight of this 
intention, I now only propose briefly to state some of the in- 
ferences I have arrived at. In doing this, however, I by no 
means would have it thought that I reserve to myself the ex- 
clusive right of entering, on a future occasion, upon the details

connected with the results now mdicated. On the contrary, 
I should be much gratified if the hints contained in this short 
notice, were to form the basis of a thorough examination of 
the whole matter, by any one who may have the time at com- 
mand, and the necessary materials within reach, for following 
up the enquiry. 

Circumstances attending the disappearance of the Shell 
from the investing siliceous Matrix. — Upon breaking up the 
masses of common flint which have been taken from the chalk, 
where that substance is quarried for economic purposes, the 
contained shells of the Echinites, or the calcareous spar re- 
presenting the shell, will be found entire, and agreeing with 
the shells which occur in the chalk itself This, however, 
is not the case with the chalk-flints that, at some remote pe- 
riod, have been removed from their original site, and sub- 
jected to diluvial action. In these latter, the shells of the 
Echini have disappeared, the removal being either total or 
partial, according to the alteration in character which the in- 
terior of the flint exhibits. In the ordinary flint- gravel, as 
for example that at Household Heath, near Norwich, the ori- 
ginal aspect of the flint is exchanged for a grey or a brownish- 
yellow colour, and then the calcareous matter of the included 
fossils is entirely gone, and the space which it occupied left 
quite free. But in other places, beds of flint may be found 
overlying the chalk, in which the change in the original con- 
dition of the silex is but slight, and the shells of the Echini

— The internal siliceous moulds of the Echini may be sepa- 
rated by readily-appreciable characters, into what I propose to 
designate as the true and \h<d false casts. The false casts are 
much more abundant than the true, and are distinguished by 
having upon that portion of their surface which corresponds to 
the internal face of the ambulacral or perforated plates of the 
shell, a series of circular and regularly concave pits. Each 
one of these pits corresponds to an ambulacral perforation ; 
but it very frequently liappens that the areas occupied by 
these hollows respectively encroach upon one another, and 
the whole then become merged into so many deep sulci, ex- 
tending from the apex of the cast to the base, and indicating 
the course of the ambulacra. Another condition, much less 
frequent than the last, but exclusively confined to the false 
casts, is an abruptly truncate summit, with a surface clearly 
showing that the deficiency cannot be explained by an acci- 
dental fracture, but rather suggesting the idea of the siliceous 
matter having entered at the mouth and vent, (the shell being

in its natural position^ without rising high enough to fill the 
entire cavity. 

The true casts principally differ from ihe false, in present- 
ing us with a faithful fac-simile of the internal surface of the 
ambulacral plates ; and unless worn smooth by bouldering, 
or other causes, the course of the ambulacra is indicated by 
rows of short, cylindrical, siliceous processes, which are, in 
fact, nothing but the casts of the ambulacral pores ; and the 
length of these processes is consequently just that of the 
thickness of the original shell. These processes upon the 
true casts, conespond to the pits upon the surface of the false 
casts. 

Now, the presence of the siliceous processes, marking the 
course of the ambulacra, is a circumstance that we should 
naturally expect, the anomaly consists in this condition being 
so generally reversed, — a hollow taking the place of 2^. projec- 
tion. Every collector of fossils has probably noticed the dif- 
ference in the two conditions, but I am not aware that any 
attempt has yet been made to explain how the difference 
originates. * The secret of the matter is simply this : — In the 
case of the true casts, the silex has not only filled the 
cavity of the shell, but it has also completely enveloped the 
shell externally, the Echinus forming as it were, the nucleus 
of the flint nodule. In the false casts the siliceous matter 
has filled the cavity of the shell, but not surrounded it with 
a mass of the same substance. Now in both these instances, 
the cavity of the Echinus is entirely filled with silex, and 
the difliculty therefore is still imaccoimted for; but if we 
take an Echinus filled with, but not surrounded by, flinty 
matter, and by an artificial process carefully remove the 
shell, it will be found, that a portion of the contained silex 
(forming the cast) is in a state of disintegration. Now it 
seems, that this process of disintegration always commences 
on those portions of the casts which are in the immediate 
neighbourhood of the natural openings of the shell, and that 
it goes forward to a greater or less extent, without the degree 
being regulated by any apparent law * ; but where the Echi- 
nus forms the nucleus of a mass of flint, the disintegrating 
process takes place ( if at all ) on the surface of the entire 
stone, and does not reach the flint within the Echinus ; con- 
sequently, the casts formed in this way, present us with an 

' I have used the term " disintegrated" silex, in the absence of a more 
appropriate designation. That this condition of the silex is an altered one 
and not the state in which it was originally deposited, I ha\ e in my pos- 
session tolcrahly conclusive evidence. 



FROM THE CHALK. 41 

exact mould of the cavity of the shell. The Echinites sim- 
ply filled with flint, after being torn from their bed of chalk 
by the operation of diluvial currents, are worn away by boul- 
dering, and the internal cast becomes exposed ; — the disin- 
tegrated silex, (no longer protected by the shelly covering), 
then separates from the rest of the mass, leaving the hollows 
or deficiencies that I have described. I do not pretend to 
explain how the disintegration of the flint originates, or to 
define the change in its mineral condition, as that enquiry 
forms a distinct subject of investigation. 

Partial silicijicatioii of the Shell itself. — The above re- 
marks have reference solely to the flint which fills the cavity 
of the shell ; but the shell itself is frequently more or less 
silicified, in this respect following a general law which ap- 
pears to me altogether inexplicable, namely, the shells which 
have undergone the greatest amount of silicification, are those 
w^hich contain false casts ; it is comparatively rare for the 
shells containing true casts, to exhibit any traces of this 
process. 

The silicifying process appears to commence at a short 
distance fi-om the natural openings of the shell, and a beau- 
tifully defined siliceous ring having been deposited around 
each of the ambulacral perforations, and also around the 
mouth and vent, the silicification frequently does not extend 
farther. At other times the silex proceeds to invest the se- 
creting membrane of the shell, where this membrane dips 
between the sutures of the separate plates ; and instances 
sometimes occur where one third or more of the calcareous 
matter is replaced by silex. 

Cavity of the Shell not always 'perfectly Jilted. — It some- 
times happens that the silex does not fill the entire cavity of 
the Echinus ; but I believe that when this is the case, it in- 
variably lines the whole internal surface of the shell, leaving 
a central hollow, the interior of which presents a chalcedonic 
or crystallized surface. The nature of this surface therefore 
readily shows, whether the deficient part of the mould arises 
from the cavity never having been filled, or from the subse- 
quent process of disintegration. The occasional imperfect fill- 
ing of the cavity of the Echini, is a condition common to 
both the true and the false casts. 

I have never yet met with an Echinus enveloped externally 
with flint, having chalk in its interior, a circumstance sufli- 
ciently curious to deserve notice. 

Distinct Crystals of Calcareous Spar on the internal sur- 
face of the Shell. — It is by no ijieans a circumstance of rare 
occurrence to find crystals of calcareous spar lining a portion, 

Vol. IV.— No. 37, n. s. g

or even the whole of the internal surface of the chalk Echini. 
These crystals are of a pyramidal figure, and each plate of 
the shell of the Echinus is occupied by the base of a single 
crystal, the size of the crystals being regulated by the size of 
the plates, an arrangement depending, I suppose, upon some 
law of crystallization with which I am not familiar. Now it 
would seem that these crystals existed before the introduction 
of the flint into the cavities of the Echinites, as I have had 
specimens in my possession in which the crystals are pre- 
sent, while the rest of the hollow is occupied by silex. ^ A 
cast formed under these circumstances has a most remarkable 
appearance ; for instead of its giving you a mould of the ca- 
vity of the shell, it is a mould of the cavity formed by the 
crystals which line the shell ; and what renders the appearance 
still more puzzling is this, that wherever the silex is in im- 
mediate contact with the crystals, the silex itself assumes a 
semi- crystalline structure. 

If the various points connected with this subject w^ere tho- 
roughly investigated, I think it probable that the result of the 
enquiry might develope some important suggestions with re- 
ference to some of the conditions under which the chalk- 
flints were deposited or aggregated. Considered zoologically, 
the enquiry is certainly not without interest ; for our know- 
ledge of some extinct organisms is drawn from natural moulds ; 
and as I have shown that these moulds are sometimes modi- 
fied by subsequent causes, all facts tending to elucidate the 
nature and possible extent of those modifications, must be 
looked upon as a means of guarding us against inferences of 
a fallacious nature.

ON THE INCUBATED EGG. 43 

the bird in ovo^ which are well worthy the attention of those of our read- 
ers who may pursue the subject of Animal Physiology. It appears that 
the anatomical modeller to the Hospital, — Mr. Joseph Town, — whose 
high talent in his profession has so largely contributed to the celebrity of 
the Museum in that establishment, received instructions from the trea- 
surer, — Mr. Harrison, — to prepare a series of models illustrative of the 
changes which occur in the egg during the period of incubation. Before 
however commencing his task, he consulted the works of Sir Everard 
Home and other writers, that he might render himself familiar with the 
opinions of previous observers, and see how far his own observations would 
tally with the views entertained in reference to this subject, by physiolo- 
gists of the present day. The result was, that in the very outset of his 
undertaking, his attention was drawn to a circumstance which seemed 
to oppose the generally-received theory of the decarbonization of the 
blood in the embryo, by its contact with the oxygen of the atmosphere ; 
and this induced him to institute a series of experiments, which convey 
the startling announcement, that the natural development of the contain- 
ed embryo goes forward and is perfected without the transmission of at- 
mospheric air to arterialize the venous circulation. 

The lining membrane of the shell, through which the air was supposed 
to pass before reaching the chorion, was remarked by Mr. Town to in- 
crease in density, and become apparently less permeable to air, in a ratio 
corresponding to the extent of time during which the process of incuba- 
tion had gone forward, a condition directly opposed to that which might have 
been expected to obtain, assuming the correctness of the above-mention- 
ed theory of decarbonization. It then occurred to Mr. Town, that in the 
cases in which it had been found that incubation did not go forward 
when a barrier was put to the supposed egress of atmospheric air, that a 
source of fallacy might have been present, in the employment of a sub- 
stance to protect the shell, which, from its noxious qualities had been 
fatal to the existence of the contained embryo. Having determined to 
satisfy himself on this point, Mr. Town informs us that he repeated the 
experiment in question in the following manner. — 

" Having selected a number of fresh eggs, as nearly as I could of the 
same size and form, I varnished them over, many times, with albumen, 
which had been allowed to stand for some time in an open vessel, until, 
by evaporation, it had acquired considerable consistence : this was re- 
peated until the shells appeared completely lackered. I then, with a 
pencil, marked one of them into equal sections, like the divisions in an 
orange, and cut a piece of card to correspond exactly with one of these 
divisions ; then a great number of papers similar to this card ; and ma-

cerated them for two days in albumen, until they were thoroughly satu- 
rated, and so soft and pulpy that I could readily apply them to the egg, 
and bring the edges so well together, that the joining was scarcely ob- 
servable. After having covered the eggs in this way, and allowed them 
to dry, I repeated the papering and varnishing four times ; taking care 
to bring the middle of each section opposite the joining in the previous 
coating. They were now covered with four thicknesses of paper, satu- 
rated as described ; besides very numerous coatings of albumen, used as 
a varnish, first on the shell, and subsequently between each layer of pa- 
per ; the whole forming a covering so thick and horny, that I felt con- 
vinced it was entirely impermeable." 

The eggs thus protected were submitted to incubation on the 11th of 
April, and such of them as were examined during different periods of the 
process exhibited the development of the embryo without any deviation 
from its normal condition, the chick arriving at maturity in the same 
time as when placed under ordinary circumstances. To render the ex- 
periment doubly sure, it was afterwards repeated, and attended with a 
similar result, though in addition to the covering already described, there 
were added several coatings of oil-paint, purposely prepared with the most 
noxious materials, as a test of the air-proof nature of the protection used 
in the first instance. 

Another observation of importance recorded by Mr. Town, is that upon 
his removing a large portion of the shell without injury to the chorion, 
while circulation was going forward, no visible eS"ect was produced on 
the blood by the admission of atmospheric air. 

" The blood still continued to leave the chick of a livid-red or venous 
colour, pass to the chorion, and, after having circulated through that 
membrane, was returned to the chick of a bright scarlet ; and this dif- 
ference remained perfectly apparent so long as the circulation continued ; 
and then, but not until then, the atmosphere appeared to act upon the 
blood ; and both arteries and veins became alike bright scarlet, as if 
this change were efiected by circulating through the chorion, and de- 
pended on some principle of vitality." 

It appears to us that Mr. Town's first experiment might be advanta- 
geously varied by placing the egg in a condition under which the possi- 
ble access of atmospheric air would be even still more effectually guarded 
against. It might, for instance, protected in the way he has describ- 
ed, — be immersed in mercury, — and then subjected, in an hermetically 
sealed vessel, to the temperature under which artificial incubation is 
known to be produced. The development of the embryo under these 
circumstances, even though the experiments already performed may be

thought to have proved enough, would still he a result sufficiently inte- 
resting to repay the trouble of the attempt.' 

Mr. Town's paper is illustrated by a number of coloured and beauti- 
fully executed lithographic drawings, and his observations contain seve- 
ral other matters of great interest, but into the details of which we do not 
enter ; our object having been rather to point out the channel through 
which he has made public his experiments and deductions, than to dis- 
cuss the physiological considerations they involve. 

The first step has just been taken to establish a Society for the promo- 
tion of Natural History by means of microscopical observations, and a 
meeting, with that object in view, was held a few days back at the Hor- 
ticultural Society's rooms, in Regent Street. Our own feeling is strongly 
opposed to the multiplication of scientific bodies, upon the principle 
that one association of the kind, well supported, can do more to promote 
the interests of science, than can be effected by the exertions of half a 
dozen, when each is restricted to a particular department of research, 
and, from that very restriction, probably cramped in its available re- 
sources for prosecuting the contemplated purpose of its formation. In 
the present instance, however, the proposed institution cannot justly be 
regarded as any off-shoot from a parent stock. The nature of the enqui- 
ries it contemplates pursuing, is as independent and distinct as the field 
which lies before it is boundless ; and if only a reasonable share of sup- 
port be proffered it by the cultivators of science, its establishment must 
eventually give rise to the happiest results. 

The new year opens with a rich promise of additions to our scientific 
literature. Messrs. Whitehead and Co. announce for publication an il- 
lustrated work upon the history of the entire class Mammalia, in which 
all the known species will be described and figured. Having some know- 
ledge of the great capital embarked in this undertaking, and entertain- 
ing a high opinion of the zoological acquirements of the author — Mr. 
Martin, we anticipate in this work a contribution to Natural History of 
no ordinary importance. Mr. Bowerbank is ready with the first part of 
his history of the Sheppey fossil fruits, — a work which will put the sci- 
entific world in possession of the contents of his unique collection, and 
the result of many years most diligent research into the history of this 
little-known class of organic remains. A wide and comparatively untrod-

British Natural History, in the hands of Mr. Van Voorst, seems to

of gratification ; — a History of our indigenous species in the families As-

active preparation, on the Fishes of Madeira, to the same able superin- 
tendance ; and a volume, styled " The Canadian Naturalist" makes its 
appearance from the same quarter. Our own publishers, Messrs. Long- 
man and Co., promise an illustrated history of the various breeds of our 
domesticated animals, by the celebrated agricultural professor, Mr. Low, 
and a revised edition of Turton's Land and Fresh-water Shells, by Mr. 
Gray, of the British Museum.

New Species of Siphonia from the Yorkshire 
C/m/A;.— TntheMag. Nat. Hist, for 1839 (page 10), 
it was observed that the numerous specimens of 
Spongice and Siphonicd from the chalk in the 
neighbourhood of Bridlington, exhibit such vari- 
eties of form, that it is difficult, and in some cases 
almost impossible, to distinguish the species. — 
The Siphonia of which the annexed figure (fig. 2) 
is a reduced sketch, is, however, marked by such 
distinctive characters, that I have ventured to 
consider it as a new species, under the name of Si- 
phonia fusiformis. At the time the account above 
referred to was written, I was not aware of the ex- 
istence of this species ; the specimen from which 
the drawing was taken had been received some 
time since from Mr. Wilson, the lapidary, of Brid- 
lington Quay, and had inadvertently been laid 
aside amongst a number of duplicates.

SiPHONiA fusiformis. — Irregularly fusiform, very much elongated, the 
summit composed of a cluster of naked tubes. 

This species may at once be distinguished by the form of 
the crown, and by its great length, which is equal to about 
ten times its greatest breadth. The stem, near the root, con- 
tains as usual a single canal, which, at the distance of four 
inches from the bottom, is divided into four or five ; the num- 
ber is encreased on approaching the summit, which is pierced 
by about twelve apertures (fig. 3). These canals are neither 
so crowded as those of Siphonia clava, nor 
so large and distant from each other as 
those of Slph. anguilla. The appearance 
of the crown is that of a cluster of thick, 
solid tubes, but this character is lost at a 
short distance from the extreme point. The 
annexed sketch, which is drawn of the na- 
tural size, will give an idea of the general 
appearance of the summit. The length of 
the whole specimen is more than fourteen inches. — John Ed-

day ; this is I believe the second occurrence of this bird in 
that county, and it is rather singular, that in the other instance 
the bird was bought in Plymouth market in 1804, by my 
brother, Wm. Prideaux, and presented to the late Col. Mon- 
tagu, and is now in the British Museum ; it was, killed in the

Habits of the different Species of Sterna and Larus. The 
sandy island of Mareat is quite covered with salt plants, be- 
tween w^hich thousands of sea-birds had built their nests, in 
different groups, according to the different species. T re- 
marked five species that had collected there for the purpose 
of hatching their young : Sterna affinis, St. nigra, St. tenui- 
rostris, Larus leucophthahnus, and Lar. Jiavipes. Each 
species had occupied a division by itself, in which the several 
nests were hardly a foot distant from each other. Tn each 
nest of four of the groups there was only one egg, in a much- 
advanced stage of incubation ; in the nests of Sterna nigra 
only were there two eggs. The sailors collected a great num- 
ber of eggs, every one of which they were obliged to throw 
away. It was heart-rending to hear the cries of the disturb- 
ed birds, which were so eager to hatch that those which had

Society for Microscopical Investigation. — A meeting was 
held at the house of E. J. Quekett, Esq., Wellclose Square, 
Sept. 3rd., 1839, to take into consideration the propriety of 
forming a society for the promotion of microscopical investi- 
gation, and for the introduction and improvement of the mi- 
croscope, as a scientific instrument ; — The following gentle- 
men were present : — Rev. J. T. Bean, Rev. J. B. Reade, Dr. 
F. Farre, Messrs. Francis, Greening, Jackson, Lister, G. Lod- 
diges, C. Loddiges, E. J. Quekett, Rippingham, Ross, R. H. 
Solly, C. Varly, N. B. Ward, and A. White. It was "Re- 
solved, that such a society should be formed ; that a provi- 
sional committee be appointed to carry the resolution into 
effect ; and that the said committee do consist of the under- 
mentioned gentlemen ; — Messrs. Bowerbank, Lister, Loddi- 
ges, Quekett, Reade, Solly, and Ward." The provisional 
committee, in accordance with the above resolution, having 
prepared an outline of a constitution for the society, a meet- 
ing was held at the Horticultural Society's rooms, Regent- 
street, on Friday evening, the 20th instant. The meeting 
was numerously attended. Professor Owen, F.R.S., &c., took 
the chair, and was elected president ; after which, the treasu- 
rer, N. B. Ward, Esq., the secretary. Dr. A. Farre, and the 
council were appointed. The constitution prepared by the 
provisional committee was unanimously adopted by the meet- 
ing, and the president announced,' that the future meetings 
of the society would be held in the Horticultural Society's 
rooms. The society will be designated the "Microscopical 
Society." Its objects are, to promote improvements in the 
optical and mechanical construction of microscopes ; the 
reading and discussion of papers, upon new and interesting 
subjects of microscopical enquiry ; the formation of a col- 
lection of rare and valuable microscopical objects; and of a 
library of reference. At the close of the business of the 
evening, upwards of fifty gentlemen joined the society. The 
terms upon which members are admitted, are one guinea en- 
trance, and a yearly subscription to the same amount.

The greater proportion of these caves have their entrances so 
disposed, that rain-water penetrates into them, either in the 
shape of casual or periodical floods, or else in that of con- 
stant streams. This water has often no other outlet than 
the fissures in the floor of the cave; but it not unfre- 
quently pursues its course quite through, and escapes by an- 
other aperture. The rain-water necessarily brings with it soil 
and organic remains, which it is highly necessary to distin- 
guish from the older deposits of the same kind ; and fortu- 
nately this is no very difficult point. The dry bed of former 
floods is often so distinguishable that it cannot easily escape 
notice. A channel, often so deep in the soil as to expose the 
rock, and strewed with sand and boulders, admits of no 
doubt ; and in it besides are often found shells of recent Mol- 
hisca, branches, roots, and leaves of trees, (Sec. 

When this proof is wanting, the condition and contents of 
the soil itself will serve to characterize it. Should it be loose 
and light, of a grey or black colour; — or if it contain the 
slightest trace of vegetable remains, uncarbonized ; — then 
there can be no doubt of its recent origin, even in the rare 
contingency of our not being able to discover the passage by 
which it has entered, which is usually easy enough to per- 
ceive. Where these distinguishing marks are all absent, the 
determination becomes more diflficult. In some caverns I 
have seen alluvial deposits in which no trace of vegetable re- 
mains could be detected, and which notwithstanding, if they 
have not been introduced at late periods by water, have at

least been exposed to its influence. The characters most to 
be depended on in the latter case, are a very pale dull colour, 
approaching to ashen-grey; a greater intermixture of sand 
than usual on the surface, with a diminution in the quantity 
downwards ; the presence of rolled stones lying loose on the 
surface ; the absence of saltpetre, and of the stalagmitic coat- 
ing: — these signs are sufficient to prove that rain-water has 
gained admission into the caverns, and operated on the soil 
therein, though it may not have originally deposited the latter. 
Caverns of this description demand the most careful examina- 
tion ; for not only might recent bones be covered with soil 
deposited by the water in its passage, but also, really ancient 
fossils, which had previously lain in the soil, might be washed 
out by the same agency, and deposited in places where their 
origin and age might easily be mistaken. I have seen exam- 
ples of both these cases ; but I must confess that the great 
majority of caverns here, present no such difficulties, but in 
general have a single opening in the perpendicular, naked 
face of a rock, high above the surrounding soil, and most fre- 
quently protected by a projecting roof of limestone. A layer 
of reddish stalagmite is spread, like a carpet, over the soil of 
the cavern, and serves to mark the boundary between the past 
and the present. None of nature's devastating forces have 
here had place ; all lies undisturbed, and in the same condi- 
tion as when deposited by that mighty catastrophe which 
closed the curtain over a former world and its inhabitants. — 
Such is the theatre to which I wish to introduce the reader ; 
for what this mantle covers — what this soil contains, belongs 
without exception to that extinct world. 

The nature and condition of the fossils themselves often 
afford still better means of determining their age. In by far 
the greater number of instances they present the following 
appearances. The bones are entire and uninjured, with their 
smallest processes and their finest points and edges well pre- 
served. Their exterior is of a beautiful reddish ochre-yellow, 
and their fractured interior of the purest white. They are much 
lighter than recent bones, and so extremely brittle as to crum- 
ble to pieces if carelessly handled : they adhere closely to ihe 
tongue : if exposed to the action of fire, they turn black, and 
give out, although in a slight degree, a burnt and fetid odour. 
A portion of the soil in which they have lain always adheres 
to these bones, either in the form of a fine dust or coating, or 
as filling up their cavities. When the enveloping soil has been 
saturated with lime-water, it adheres so closely to the bone 
that it is impossible to separate the two. More rarely the bones, 
without losing their uninjured surface, or the pure white co-

lour and osseous structure which they display when broken, 
have their cells lined, or sometimes quite filled, with a stony 
substance, and their weight is consequently so much increased 
that they appear to be of the same specific gravity as lime- 
stone. There is yet a third condition, in which these bones 
depart still farther from their original character than in the 
two above named ; that is, where the organic structure has 
entirely disappeared, and calcareous spar is substituted for the 
osseous substance. This alteration, I have satisfied myself, 
is owing to the bones having lain long under water. 

It will next be my object to point out the mechanical 
changes which these fossils have undergone, and which may 
be treated of under three classes. First; splits and frac- 
tures in all directions, but for the most part longitudinal, 
and not unfrequently accompanied by a more or less evident 
compression of the bone. In these cases the interior surface 
of the medullary cavity and of the cellular structure, as well 
as the sides of the fracture, are of the same reddish yellow 
colour as the exterior : and if the soil be impregnated with 
calcareous particles, then are these internal surfaces overlaid 
with a thin coating of very fine crystals of calcareous spar ; 
but they are never filled with earth. Besides, the outer sur- 
face being perfectly uninjured, it is clear that these bones 
have been buried in the soil in a more or less fresh condition, 
and that it was only from their increasing brittleness, that in 
the course of time they have begun to yield to the continual 
superincumbent pressure. To this class also belong those 
injuries of which I have spoken in describing the cave of 
Maquine. The bones, in that case, were not only split in all 
directions, but often quite crushed ; yet in such a manner that 
the fragments lay by the side of each other in their natural 
position. In the same paper I have shown how this fact, as 
well as some others met with in that cavern, can only be ex- 
plained by the supposition of effects produced on the animals, 
when still clothed with flesh and skin, by vast masses of rock. 

The second class of mechanical changes which these bones 
have undergone, has been effected by the teeth of predatory 
animals. And again, these changes depend partly on the 
resistance the bones were calculated to offer, — partly on the 
character of the animal that attacked them. Such laeasts of 
prey as derive a considerable quantity of nutriment from the 
bones themselves, and for that purpose are provided with 
crushing teeth, like the huge hyaenas of the Old World, the 
remains of which are found in European caves, w^ere want- 
ing in this part of the globe, and were represented by others, 
which have left the records of their existence imprinted in a 



52 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

much less destructive form on the relics of their prey. Of 
this class I need only remark, that the fragments are scattered 
promiscuously together, and are enveloped in, and filled with, 
earth. Moreover, ihey are often gnawed by the teeth of small 
animals. 

The third kind of mechanical change which these bones 
exhibit, is an abrasion of their points and angles, which, in a 
former communication, I conceive that I have proved to be 
attributable to the action of the water which formerly had ac- 
cess to the caves wherein they are found. 

In all the cases of which I have hitherto spoken, the bones 
have been protected from the action of the atmosphere, either 
by their stalagmitic covering, or by lying in water. But 
many have not been so favourably circumstanced. Many 
have I seen which, from their peculiarly raised position in 
the middle of a basin in the floor, have escaped being buried 
in the soil ; and these present the most remarkable examples 
of the destructive power of time. Their most exposed parts 
are mouldered away, and changed into a yellowish dust, 
which, by covering the inferior portions, has protected these 
from decomposition. In those caverns where water has had 
access in later periods, these fossil bones have occasionally 
been torn out of their beds, and by the joint operation of water 
and air, their decomposition has been so accelerated that they 
resemble in appearance half-decomposed recent bones. This 
has come under my notice at least once ; and had it not been 
for the size of the bones, which indicated a much larger ani- 
mal than any mammal now living in this quarter of the globe, 
I confess I might have mistaken its age. Such, however, if I 
may judge from my own experience, is seldom the case; at 
any rate I can assure the Society that the above is the only 
instance open to any doubt, among the fossils forming the 
subject of this communication ; all the others were found 
under circumstances that left not the slightest question as to 
their origin. 

So much for the circumstances under which these fossils 
are found and the changes they have undergone. But before 
I proceed to a more accurate description of the animals to 
which these remains belong, it will perhaps be advisable to 
preface it with a few remarks on those existing species which 
frequented or have left their traces in the spots that have af- 
forded us so astonishing a catalogue of the creatures of a for- 
mer world. 

The first place on this list is due to the family of the bats. 
There are few caves which do not harbour at least some in- 
dividuals of this family : but to one who has not been an eye- 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 63 

witness of the fact, the multitudes in which they are found in 
certain caverns, must seem perfectly incredible. There are 
caverns, commonly called " Lappas dos Morcegos," that is, 
bat-caverns, which are rendered almost impassable by these 
creatures. Their liquid excrement covers considerable sur- 
faces of the walls and floor, rendering the latter so slippery 
that it is hardly safe to cross it where at all inclined ; and 
besides, the strong ammoniacal odour exhaled is enough to 
stifle the intruder whom science has lured into these murky 
labyrinths. I have seen considerable spaces of the roof so 
thickly covered with bats, that they appeared matted toge- 
ther ; and when disturbed, the universal flutter agitates the 
air so much as to extinguish the lights. Nor is it only in the 
living state that they are found, but dead or dying they are 
also seen hanging from the roof by their hind legs ; while 
their remains are strewed over the floor in every stage of de- 
composition. 

In these caves I have discovered some species of the ge- 
nera Phyllostoma, AIolossus, Glossoj^haga, Vespertilio, and 
others ; but the most abundant by far is a new geims, which, 
from its peculiar dental system, is not only far removed from 
the other genera of this family, but even stands alone in the 
order Mammalia. Of this very remarkable creature I hope 
soon to forward a description and drawings. 

As the bats hold the first place among the living inhabit- 
ants of these caves, so is it the family of rodents which have 
left the greatest number of recent bones there. And as the 
bones of the Rodentia form no inconsiderable portion of the 
fossil remains ; — and the species of this family at present ex- 
isting in these parts being besides very imperfectly known ; 
— it will be advisable to offer a short sketch of them : pre- 
mising that in their enumeration, as well as in that of all 
others that may follow, I strictly confine myself to those 
which, either from my own observation, or from the reports of 
trustworthy witnesses, I know to be inhabitants of the dis- 
trict in which these caverns are situated. * 

' Brazil embraces, witliin its extensive boundaries, great varieties of cli- 
mate and other physical conditions. In the southern provinces, most of 
the tropical forms, both of animals and vegetal)les, disappear, and are re- 
placed by new ones. There is scarcely less difference observ^able in com- 
paring the interior highlands with the narrow tract which extends along 
the coast, and is bounded by a high, wooded, wall of rock. For this reason 
I have not been able to confine myself to mere political divisions. And be- 
sides, as it is an indubitable truth that the extinct animals have in general 
lived in the spots where their remains are now found, a geographical com- 
parison of existing and extinct animals must necessafily be confined to the 
district where the latter occur.

?^4 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

I naturally place at the head of the rodents the largest yet 
known — the Kapivar. It is spread over all the warm parts 
of eastern South America, and its amphibious habits partially 
protect it from the fate to which it is doomed in consequence 
of its depredations on the corn-fields. There is but one known 
species of this genus, — the Hydrochwrus Capibara. 

The next in size and abundance is the Paca, — Coelogenys 
Paca, This is much prized for its flesh, and its numbers 
have in consequence sensibly decreased in many places. Its 
colour varies through all shades, from a light yellow-brown 
to a black-brown. I confess that I cannot, from my own ex- 
perience, affirm a distinction between Ccel. fulvus and Coel. 
fuscus ; and the Brazilians, who have a remarkably good eye 
for permanent marks of distinction, and who often perceive 
specific differences where a naturalist can see only varieties, 
are unanimous in recognizing but one species of Paca. The 
same is the case with the Gutia [Dasyprocta Aguii), and the 
Perea [Cavia Aperea), — the only species of their respective 
genera in those parts of Brazil which I have visited. Of the 
genus Lepus there is but one species (Lep. Tapeti), of an in- 
termediate character between the rabbit and the hare, though 
in its habits it agrees best with the latter. There is likewise 
but a single species of squirrel {Sciurus mstuans) : and finally 
the list closes with an animal [Sphiggiirus spinosa^ F. Cuv.), 
which, from its sluggishness and awkwardness, would ere this 
have been nearly extinct, had it not been provided by nature 
with a formidable cuirass, by which it is protected from all 
its enemies. 

Such is the catalogue of the rodents hitherto known and 
described as inhabiting this district ; but the number which 
has escaped the observation of naturalists is still greater, and 
as they fill a distinguished part in the history of the inhabit- 
ants of these caverns, it is important that the reader should 
be made acquainted with them. 

I begin with the genus Echimys, or spiny rat, of which 
there are four species in these parts, all different from those 
of Paraguay and Guiana. The largest of them is about the 
size of the Perea, w^hile the others are not larger than our 
common house-rat. They are nocturnal animals, passing the 
day in subterranean holes in the woods, and feeding not only 
on frogs, but on insects, the wings and elytra of which are 
seen strewn outside their holes. They present several pe- 
culiarities in their internal structure ; but on the whole ap- 
proach nearest to the porcupine {Hystrix), which they serve 
to connect, in many points, with the cavies, and especially 
with the genus Dasyprocta ; while in occasional features they 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 55 

remind us of the true rats. The commonest species, of 
which we shall have occasion to speak more at large hereaf- 
ter, is distinguished from the others by a gi'oove or fun'ow on 
the front of the incisors, for which reason I propose to name 
it Echiviys sulcidens. 

Of the genus Mus I am acquainted with five sj)ecies, which 
all appear different to those described by Azara and Reng- 
ger Irom Paraguay. Two of these infest houses, the three 
others keep out in fields and woods. One of the former ap- 
pears to me identical with our own house-mouse [Mus mus- 
culas), but the other is quite different from our two kinds of 
house-rat, Mus decumanus and Mus rattus. I call it for the 
present, Mus setosus, on account of the long black bristles 
which are scattered here and there over its skin. This spe- 
cies w^as introduced into these parts about the commencement 
of the present century ; and it has driven out of the houses a 
smaller species, of a pretty chocolate-brown on the back, 
chesnut-brown on the sides, and white on the belly, with a 
fine short fur, and a short silky tail : the latter species has 
become rare, and is now only seen about cultivated fields. — 
A fourth and still smaller species frequents gardens : it is of 
the same size as our house-mouse, has a large head, with large 
hairy ears, and a very short tail. I have named it AIus lasi- 
otis. But the most remarkable species of this genus lives 
only in the woods. I have hitherto been unable to procure a 
single specimen in fresh condition ; but I have found it abun- 
dant in the stomachs of the larger diurnal and nocturnal birds 
of prey. Its tail is provided with stiff bristles ; on which ac- 
count I have given it the temporary name of Mus lasiurus. 

After this cursory sketch of the rodents inhabiting this dis- 
trict,' I shall proceed to consider them with reference to the 
remains which they have left in the caves, in order to explain 
thereby some points connected with the history of the fossil 
bones in the same places. 

I commence with the common Brazilian wood-rat, Mus 
lasiurus. I know of very few caves in which remains of this 
animal are not found ; and in many they occur in such pro- 
digious quantities, as to excite the utmost astonishment. To 
convey some idea of this, 1 will give a brief description of the 
first cavern of this kind that I had an opportunity of examin- 
ing near Caxoero do Campo. This cavern is one hundred and 
twenty feet long, from six to nine feet wide, and from thirty 

* The Moco {Kerodon rupestre) is not found within the district in which 
the caves are situated, although the southern boundary of its habitat is but 
a few degrees from that locality. 



56 EXTIxNCT FAHiNA OF BRAZIL. 

to forty feet in height. Its floor, for a distance of twenty feet 
from the entrance, was covered with a "bed of earth, perfectly 
identical with the soil outside, and which had evidently been 
w^ashed in by rain water. Farther in, this bed of earth dis- 
appeared, and was replaced by a layer of very loose brownish 
or black mould, about a foot thick, and completely full of 
small bones, more abundant in some places than in others. — 
I filled a box, containing about half a cubic foot, with this 
mould ; and on my return home counted in it about 2,000 
separate rami of the under jaw of Mus lasiuriis, and about 
400 of Dldelphis miiriniis^ besides a small number of the 
jaws of other animals, of which I shall presently speak more 
particularly. These bones were for the most part broken : 
only the smaller, such as those of the feet, the vertehrce, and 
the strongest long bones, being entire. All the skulls, with- 
out exception, were fractured, so that a portion of each, par- 
ticularly the ossa int€7' par let alia ^ was usually wanting: the 
weaker ascending ramus of the under jaw was also generally 
absent. The bones were in different states of preservation, 
according to the position occupied by them in the bed of 
earth ; those lying deepest being brown, brittle, and adhesive 
to the tongue, properties which diminished upwards, so that 
the uppermost of all were very fresh. Upon the surface of 
the earth lay scattered the elytra and legs of beetles. 

The extraordinary collection of bones at this place, and 
their fractured condition, led me involuntarily to the conclu- 
sion, that they must have been introduced by some predatory 
animal; and subsequent examination has taught me to recog- 
nize this animal in the common Brazilian owl, Strix perlata. 
This owl is met with in abundance in the caverns, where also 
I have had frequent opportunities of examining its nest, 
imder which I have invariably found a heap of ball-shaped 
bodies, from an inch and a half to two inches in diameter. — 
These balls consist of tangled hair, intermixed with the above- 
mentioned bones ; and are the w ell-known balls cast up by 
all predatory birds after digesting the flesh of their prey. — 
They fall asunder in the course of time, when the less dura- 
ble portions, such as the hair &c., moulder away, and form 
the loose soil before spoken of, in which the bones lie scat- 
tered about. I have had frequent opportunities of tracing 
the formation of these heaps from their first commencement : 
but to remove all possibility of doubt, I kept several species 
of owls in my own house, and supplied them with small mam- 
mals and birds; and under my own eye they cast up the very 
same sort of balls filled with bones, which exhibited exactly 
the same marks of injury as those in the caves. 



M. RANG ON THE ARGONAUT. 57 

With regard to the species to which the bones in the balls 
have belonged, I have found the following kinds, and in about 
the following proportions. Out of 1000 individuals, Mus la- 
smrw5 constitutes 800; Didelphis murinus, 100; Echimys 
sulcidefis, 50 ; small birds, 20 ; bats, 10 ; a smaller species of 
Mus, which I consider to be Mus lasiotis, 10; and the re- 
maining 10 are composed of the three other species of Echi- 
mys, together with some young individuals of rabbit and Perea 
in about equal proportions. Unconnected with this heap of 
bones are frequently found the remains of the two larger spe- 
cies of this family, — the Paca and the Gutia. The numer- 
ous foot-prints of the first of these animals, which may be 
observed in almost all the caves, prove that it is a constant 
visitor at least ; and indeed, in some caverns, where their path 
lay over narrow passes, I have seen the limestone quite po- 
lished by their feet. 

Of the three other species of this family, the Kapivar, the 
Sphiggurus and the squirrel, I have as yet discovered neither 
traces nor remains.

Art. II. — On the Genus Argonauta. By M. Rang. 

( Continued from, page 1 Q) . 

Let us now turn to the consideration of a fact of more impor- 
tance, and which, beyond contradiction, furnishes one of the 
strongest arguments apparently at least in favour of parasitism. 
M. de Blainville very ingeniously makes use of our disco- 
very to corroborate the opinion that he advocates ; and it is 
with that clearness which runs throughout his demonstrations, 
that he here developes his views, which are undoubtedly very 
likely to carry us along with him, but which, nevertheless, 
rest upon an observation, respecting which we are somewhat 
at variance, so that we do not find in this new argument all 
the force which at the first glance it appears to possess. The 
Professor, admitting our assertion that the poulp of the argo- 
naut crawls with its tube above, that is to say, according to 
his idea, with the ventral part uppermost, remarks that in this 
respect the poulp completely differs from the ordinary Octopi 
which he has observed upon the shores of Provence, and par- 
ticularly from the Oct. moschatus. These Octopi, he says, 
crawl by dragging themselves along the ground, but always 



58 M. SANDER RANG 

with the tube below, and the dorsal region above ; and he 
consequently infers that our argonautic Octopus is in an ano- 
malous position, while the Octopi, properly so called, are in 
a normal one : from which M. de Blainville deduces a new 
proof of the parasitism of the animal. 

Without venturing to discuss the validity of this argument, 
we will merely observe that if we do not admit it, it is in a 
great measure because we are not agreed as to its elements. 

We have often seen Octopi out of the water, in the act of 
progression ; and a drawing made on the coasts of Provence 
by M. de Blainville himself, and which he very kindly showed 
us, appeared in some measure to confirm what we on our part 
had observed. The species we have seen is precisely the 
same as that which engaged the attention of this naturalist; 
we have found it in the same position as he did, but we are 
far from affirming that it assumes no other, for we have often 
observed the contrary. 

The Octopus moschatus is undoubtedly, of all the species, 
the one which most readily accommodates itself to this expe- 
riment, not only because it is the most common in the nets of 
the MediteiTanean fishermen, but also because, when out of 
the water, it exhibits surprising strength and agility. We 
have studied it in the road of Algiers, at the instant when the 
fishermen hoisted up their nets, almost always full, upon the 
deck of their boats. Escaping through the meshes, these ani- 
mals would run about, endeavouring to regain the sea ; and 
nothing in fact could be more curious than the motions used 
to attain that end. They did not crawl in the manner of 
gasteropods, but holding themselves bent double, so that only 
their head and the extremity of their sac rested upon the deck, 
they seemed to gallop at a great rate, if we may so express 
ourselves, enlarging their back or stomach according to their 
position ; while their arms, which they carried before them, 
or by their sides, had an undulatory or serpentine motion, 
and, fixing themselves alternately by their suckers, assisted 
the Octopus to draw itself along, while raising itself on its 
extremities. What we inferred from this was, that when out 
of the water, these invertebrate animals move themselves as 
they can, by the power of the arms furnished with suckers, 
according to the position in which they find themselves 
placed, and according to the vitality remaining in them. This 
condition is really an accidental one for them, since by the 
nature of their organization, the power of living habitually 
out of the water has not been granted to them, and conse- 
quently they have not been provided with any particular organ 
for terrestrial progression. But their normal state is when 



I 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 59 

they are in the water ; it is there only that they enjoy the fa- 
culties for action which have been given them ; and in the 
water we affirm that they never crawl or progress in the man- 
ner above described, any more than that they swim in turning 
upon themselves, as has been advanced. 

We do not however altogether disallow the force of the ar- 
gument advanced by M. de Blainville, and this is the way in 
which we understand it. If we suppose that a poulp, from 
the nature of its exigences, and from its peculiarly pelagian 
destiny, is compelled to have recourse to a shell in which to 
lodge itself, and pass the whole or a part of its life, we must 
certainly admit, in some of its organs, a particular pre -arrange- 
ment or modification. It would, for example, be necessary 
that nature should have provided it with organs specially des- 
tined to maintain its position within this foreign covering ; — 
and such organs we find in the membraniferous arms of the 
poulp we are now considering. Thus, when we meet with 
an animal surrounded by these peculiarities, — a mollusc in 
this anomalous state, — we may be justified in considering it 
to be a parasite, but can we affirm with certainty that it is so? 
It is after all but a presumption ; and to consider the para- 
sitism demonstrated, would perhaps be hardly compatible 
with sound logic. 

We cannot conclude this portion of our memoir without 
remarking that Ferussac, a short time before his death, as we 
have just learned, entertained the idea that the membranifer- 
ous arms of the poulp of the argonaut were disposed by the 
poulp upon the lateral faces of the shell ; this, at least, is 
what we found expressed in a letter, written by him to M. 
Pretre, requesting from him a new plate for his great work on 
the cryptodibranchiate cephalopods, and which letter that 
skilful artist very willingly communicated to us. The pas- 
sage is as follows. — "In the second phial is a specimen in its 
shell (of which also a view must be taken), and having the 
large membrane very much spread out with great care over 
the shell, in the same position as its arm." Unfortunately, 
neither the animals nor the beautiful drawing made by M. 
Pretre are to be found; and the sentence we have just quoted 
is all that we possess by Ferussac relating to a subject which 
it would have been very interesting to see treated of by him. 

Locomotive Faculty of the Argonaut in deep water. — When 
in deep water the poulp of the argonaut swims in the same 
manner as other cryptodibranchial cephalopods, — by the re- 
jection of the water introduced into the sac by means of a 
tube situated opposite to the anus. Such is the third obser- 



60 M. SANDER RANG 

vaiion we have made ; it evidently tends to restore this poulp 
to the normal state of the other cephalopods, from w^hich it 
has been so strangely separated ; — it destroys the fabulous 
notions of the navigation of the argonaut ; — it explains why it 
is necessary that this poulp should have two palmated arms 
to retain its shell ; — and finally, it overturns the argument 
drawn from the divergence of opinions as to the manner in 
which the poulp swims on the surface of the water, and on 
which was founded the statement that the parasitic inhabit- 
ant of the argonaut was not always a poulp with palmated 
arms, or else that it did not always place itself in the same 
relation to the shell. 

Locomotive Faculty of the Poulp of the Ai^gonaut at the 
bottom of the Sea. — The observation we have just made, and 
the description we gave at the commencement of this memoir 
of the manner in which the poulp of the argonaut crawls along 
the bottom of the sea, [constitute a fact which is quite new, 
and which seems not to have been previously observed. It is 
nevertheless but just to state that it had already been pointed 
out ; for Rumphius long ago said that this mollusc walked at 
the bottom of the sea by the aid of its arms, and with the keel 
of its shell uppermost. We then merely give a more detailed 
confirmation of his observation. It naturally follows from 
what we have said on this subject, that these poulps do not 
always carry themselves with their ventral part beneath, but 
frequently also with it above. 

This observation weakens still more the opinion of those 
naturalists who suppose that the palmated arms are turned to 
the side of the anterior part of the shell, and of those who 
think that the mollusc places itself indifferently either one 
way or the other ; and draw from thence an argument for its 
non-parasitism. And finally, it also restores the poulp to a 
more normal state than that which had been assigned to it. 

Will not this peculiar mode of reptation at the bottom of 
the sea explain why the poulp in question, supposing it to be 
the real constructor of the shell, should preserve a space at 
the end, instead of filling the forsaken part with a solid de- 
posit, like the Magilus, or forming partitions there, like 
the Nautilus ? May it not be for the purpose of preserving 
a reservoir of air, in order to facilitate its rapid and vertical 
ascent to the surface of the water ? Rumphius, who was a 
close observer, as we have just shown, seems to confirm this 
idea, when, in referring to this mollusc, he remarks that it 
also re-ascends in a reversed position ; that is, with its head 
below and the keel of its shell above. In fact, is it not evi- 
dently for the purpose of retaining the air compressed by it 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 61 

into the bottom of the shell, that the poulp thus holds itself 
upside down during its ascension ? If, on the contrary, it 
ascended with the keel downwards, this air could not failjto 
escape, and it would then be necessary for the animal to use 
its organs of " refoulement" to remedy this loss. This remark 
will perhaps appear strange to some persons ; but it is cer- - 
tain that many of the MoUnsca and AcalepJia ascend on this 
principle : and we have many times seen them leave at the 
surface of the sea, the bubble of air which they had undoubt- 
ly obtained at the bottom by means of some peculiar faculty. 

Examination of the arguments wliicli have been presented 
in favour of one or the other opinion. — M. de Blainville, in 
his interesting letter, has advanced a series of arguments in 
favour of parasitism, to the greater part of which our preced- 
ing observations apply. But there are some still remaining, 
to which we have objections to oppose; such as, for exam- 
ple, his fourth argument, which is drawn from the absence of 
organic attachment between the shell and the animal, a cir- 
cumstance tending to indicate that the two are foreign to each 
other. 

We quite agree with those naturalists who recognise this 
want of attachment ; in fact there is no other connection be- 
tween the shell and the animal, than that of contact, and this 
argument has always been regarded as one of the most valid : 
we can, however, meet it by another, namely, that the true 
constructor of the shell, supposing it not to be the poulp, did 
not adhere to it either ; since, contrary to what we observe in 
other shells, there are upon the argonaut no traces of attach- 
ment, or, in fact, of any muscular impression. This remark, 
moreover, is not our own ; it was made to us by Cuvier ten 
years ago, in a conversation with him on this subject. 

To this observation it has sometimes been objected, that 
the argonaut is evidently an internal shell. We confess that 
we should have some difficulty in picturing to ourselves an 
internal shell of this description, — so "enroulee", so symme- 
trical and diaphanous, and possessing ribs and tubercles, and, 
in short, so little analogous to all internal shells, whatever 
may be the order of Mollusca to which they belong. 

An attempt has also been made to approximate this shell 
to the genus Atlanta, which attempt rests upon some recital 
of an inhabitant of the island of Amboina, of which however 
we have nothing but a completely anecdotal report. But in 
the genus Atlanta the animal is united to the shell by a very 
evident attachment, and upon the whole there exists no rela- 
tion between the argonauts to the Atlanta on the one hand, or 
to the Carinaria on the other ; for these two nucleobranchiate 



62 M. SANDER RANG 

genera constantly possess a simj^le and central keel, which 
the argonauts do not. And again, as we have long since 
shown, the Atlanta and Carinaria are not all symmetrical in 
form, while, on the contrary, all the argonauts are so. 

In order to prove that the argonaut is inhabited by another 
mollusc, besides the membraniferous-armed poulp, a beauti- 
ful specimen of this shell, in the possession of M. de Roissy 
has been quoted, in which, by means of an accidental frac- 
ture, a torn fragment fixed to the internal wall may distinctly 
be perceived. We have not seen this shell, but from what 
M. de Roissy himself has told us of it, we do not think that 
an argument of any great weight can be drawn from this cir- 
cumstance. Are not parasites, such as the Ascidice, Anati- 
ferae, and ActinicB for instance, often found (as we ourselves 
have seen) fixed to forsaken shells } And might they not 
leave fragments of their base attached ? The argonaut of M. 
de Roissy perhaps offers an example of this kind ; there is 
nothing to prove the contrary. 

The fifth argument of M. de Blainville tends to demonstrate 
that the form of the animal has no true correspondence with 
that of the shell. We shall not retuni to this subject; for to 
establish this correspondence is exactly what we endeavoured 
to do towards the commencement of this memoir, and we find 
it still greater, now that we know the use of the membranifer- 
ous arms. 

In his ninth argument M. de Blainville expresses himself 
thus. — "The animal may be drawn out of its shell apparently 
without feeling any inconvenience, and without suspending 
its movements ; as Cranch has proved positively by experi- 
ment." Nothing is so embarrassing as to have to refute an 
argument, based upon what a person highly worthy of credit 
says he has seen. We have over and over again observed 
exactly the contrary. One may combat an opinion ; but in 
conscience one cannot tell an observer who professes to have 
seen a thing, — " You have not seen it ! " although one may 
feel certain that it never could have been so. We shall there- 
fore omit the consideration of Cranch and his poulp, and 
merely recall what we said in detailing our own observations 
upon the one that was on the point of expiring, and which, 
weakened, and scarcely retaining any life, had contracted its 
membraniferous arms, and being no longer able to hold its 
shell, was accidentally separated from it. We made the 
same observation many years ago, upon the particular species 
spoken of by Cranch, but with less of detail, because we did 
not then know the use of the large arms ; and also at a later 
period, at the Cape of Good Hope; and lastly, we have stu- 



ON THE ARGONAUT. 63 

died the facts we relate in this memoir, at Algiers. We de- 
clare that we have never seen the poulp voluntarily quit its 
shell ; and that it was only when deprived by weakness of 
the power of adhering to it by means of the organs which 
nature had given it for this purpose, that it was separated from 
it by a fortuitous circumstance, and one that was quite inde- 
pendent of its will. And if, in this case, the poulp resumed 
an appearance of activity, it was only to expend all its re- 
maining strength in one effort, and expire almost immediately. 
We shall say nothing further on this subject; for reasoning, 
in this case, can do no more, and subsequent experience only 
can show the weight of these arguments. On this ground we 
earnestly entreat those who may have opportunities of study- 
ing the poulp of the argonaut in its shell, to multiply their 
experiments on this fact as much as possible, and carefully 
to record all they witness. 

If we have found ourselves under the necessity of combat- 
ing many arguments in favour of parasitism, we have also had 
occasion to attack some of those put forward by the partisans 
of non-parasitism. We have already extinguished several of 
these, in opposing to them the use and position of the large 
arms ; as, for example, we showed that these arms were not 
directed towards the interior of the shell, on each side of the 
keel, to form the tubercles. 

We have also done away with the arguments founded on a 
pretended observation, that the animal, when drawn out of 
the shell, exhibits upon its mantle the entire form of that 
shell, and the impression of the furrows and tubercles with 
which it is ornamented. But there is a more important fact 
which ought to detain us a moment, since it has been for 
some time advanced with great success, and yet it must now 
fall to the ground. This will doubtless be the case with ma- 
ny other arguments — fruits of an active imagination — to which 
too much attention has hitherto been paid, but which perhaps 
only await a simple observation, conscientiously made upon 
the animal w^hen full of life and at liberty, to be completely 
nullified. The nature of this tact we will now explain. The 
partisans of non-parasitism thought that the best method of 
solving the problem, was, to assure themselves whether the 
rudiments of the shell of the membraniferous-armed poulp 
were to be found in the ova of the animal. This investiga- 
tion might be decisive. Many naturalists, relying solely upon 
it, soon exclaimed, " the question is decided, for the shell is 
there ! " It was a truly eminent anatomist, whose reputation 
extends throughout Europe, who first uttered the cry of vic- 
tory, which was immediately enregistered in a host of publi- 



64 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

cations, all relating the marvels of this observation, and all 
bringing forward the determination of the skilful Italian, as 
beyond appeal. Nevertheless, many other naturalists of ac- 
knowledged talent, and we must quote M. de Blainville as 
among the first, would not allow themselves to be convinced 
by hearsay, but wished to verify the fact ; but neither M. de 
Blainville, nor Sir Everard Home, nor M. Bauer, saw what 
had been announced. Still further, Madame Power, a disci- 
ple of the celebrated Poli, of whom we have already spoken 
in reference to her striking observations upon the poulp of 
the argonaut, and w^ho is one of the most enlightened defend- 
ers of non-parasitism, now gives a formal contradiction to her 
master, declaring that there is no appearance of a shell in the 
ova of the poulp ; and she then concocts a very ingenious lit- 
tle system, which can however do no prejudice to the cause 
of non-parasitism, and shows how the shell may be formed 
after the birth of the mollusc. 

As for ourselves, we also have been very curious to verify 
Poli's observations. We have tried at different times, some- 
times upon eggs which were preserved in alcohol, sometimes 
upon those we had taken quite fresh from the sea, and which 
had, without doubt, arrived at different degrees of maturity; 
and after all we never found anything but the nucleus which 
may be observed in eggs in general. 

Thus the strongest argument brought forward by the parti- 
sans of non-parasitism, must evidently give way before these 
reiterated observations.

KiLKEE stands in a little semicircular bay, which, having a 
bar of rock across its mouth, affords no shelter for shipping ; 
indeed, nothing can be more forbidding to the seaman than 
the west coast of Clare. From the Hag's Head or Mohir on 
the north, to Louphead on the south, it consists of black, 
precipitous, slate cliffs, against which the restless Atlantic 
frets itself into a perpetual foam. The whole line of coast, 
in extent about forty miles, is called Malbay ; and through- 
out the entire distance there is not a single place of safety for

shipping, and scarcely a creek to afford a doubtful and tem- 
porary shelter in extreme distress. The cliff is worn by the 
ocean into forms more wonderfully grotesque, and oft-times 
more strikingly picturesque, than the most vivid imagination 
could devise. Here a peninsula of rock stands boldly out to 
sea, and the isthmus which connects it with the land has for 
centuries lost its basement, and only exists as a bridge, hang- 
ing as it were by magic over the dark waters, which meet and 
strive, with thundering din, hundreds of feet below its aerial 
span ; — there, an enormous cleft in the face of the cliff, riven 
as by an earthquake, forms a wedge-shaped chasm, into which 
the vast waves gambol one after another like huge leviathans, 
playing a thousand antics, and sending the " playful spray " 
aloft, to be borne on the wings of the wind. Then comes 
some vast cavern, with vaulted roof and gigantic columns, 
divided maybe into a hundred minor caves, in some of which 
a ship might float with every stick standing; and from these 
caves there issues such a reverberation of the roar of waters, 
that thunder might mutter its loudest and remain unheard. 

1 took the southern cliff from Kilkee, and skirted along its 
extreme margin as best I could. AVhere it was broken and 
uneven, and I could accomplish it with safety, I descended 
the cliff as far as practicable ; I often found the crevices filled 
with Aspleiuum marinum, Aster Tripolium, Silene maritima, 
Aretiaria nfari?ia, &c. &c. Nothing could exceed the auda- 
city of the gulls while I was clambering about these cliffs : 
some of them came so near me that I could have touched 
them with a whip, and their screaming was fearful. There 
w^ere also flying around me curlews, hawks, and choughs ; 
¦ — the curlews whistling, the hawks- screeching, and the 
choughs chattering; but the gulls were the most noisy and 
numerousof alb On the top of the cliff is a short close herbage, 
of that kind which in England we call good sheep-walk ; and 
on this, and the turf walls which separated it, w^ere rooks, 
carrion crows, hooded crows, ravens, magpies, and choughs 
innumerable ; the latter bird predominating in number over 
all the others of the crow family. Further along the coast I 
saw a settlement of sea-birds ; puffins, guillemots, rasor-bills 
and corvorants, intermixed with the eteraal sea-gulls : and I 
saw three large birds which I supposed to be the great north- 
ern diver; they sat up like penguins, on a rock that just 
peeped out of the w^ater, and was now and then covered by 
the swell ; this sometimes carried off one or two of the divers, 
but they almost instantly returned and resumed their station. 
The distance from the top of the cliff to the water will, 1 think, 
afford an excuse for my inability to name the species.

These cliffs afford perfect security for eagles and hawks, 
and I have little doubt that very large numbers are annually 
bred here, as well as gulls, corvorants, and other aquatic birds. 
With regard to the gulls, I could make out but little as to 
species ; there were two of very different sizes, but nearly 
alike in colour, which I supposed to be the greater and lesser 
black-backed ; and occasionally a little covey of four or five 
individuals of Lestris would make their appearance, but these 
always seemed passing on, as though bent on other business, 
while the whiter gulls appeared to have no other amusement 
than screaming round my head ; I never was so insulted ; 
they swept round and round in semicircles, fanning me 
with their wings every time they approached : I longed for a 
gun, just to have given them an admonisher. Proceeding far- 
ther along the cliff, I found a man and boy fishing with lines 
400 feet in length. The hook was baited with the inside of 
a crab, and a stone was tied near the extremity of the line, 
and being thrown into the sea carried the line with it, which 
otherwise could not have been persuaded to make the de- 
scent. I waited some time, but to no purpose, in the hope 
of seeing a fish hauled up ; and I was equally unsuccessful 
in learning what kind of fish were taken in this way, for as 
neither party understood a word that the other said, it might 
be called on my part, " the pursuit of knowledge under diffi- 
culties." Shortly afterwards I saw a single rock dove [Co- 
lumba Livia) fly to the cliff, and apparently enter a hole ; it 
was closely pursued by a kestrel, which continued sailing 
backwards and forwards along the cliff, until I left the spot. I 
ascended a hill to examine what appeared a most singular ruin : 
on reaching this 1 found it was only a Napoleon- tower, with a 
small portion rearing its head high over the shapeless mass 
of ruins which surrounded it. The view from this tower is 
magnificent ; you can see nearly two hundred miles of coast, 
so ruggedly rocky, so curiously indented, and so intermixed 
with sea, that it requires a tolerable degree of map-knowledge 
to understand the objects you are beholding. 

The high promontory on which this tower stands, termi- 
nates in Cape Lean, or, as it is usually termed. Loop-head. 
After enjoying the splendid panorama to my heart's content, 
I turned southward, and soon falling in with a road or track, 
returned to Kilkee. The ferns of this promontory are Las- 
trcBa Filix-mas^ rare; Las. dilatata, abundant; Athyrium 
Filix-fwmina, abundant ; Pieris aquilhia, sparingly ; Os- 
mimda regalis, abundant ; Tom aria spicant^ not frequent ; 
Asplenium marhium, abundant. The population is very 
great in the neighbourhood of Kilkee and Kilrush ; the cabins

are thickly sprinkled over the whole surface of the countrj^ 
except along the high cliffs by the sea. There was a great 
deal of oats, wheat, rye, and potato3S, in small patches at- 
tached to the cabins ; the wheat and rye in ear, the oats back- 
ward, and potatoes not looking vigorous, the ground being 
very conspicuous between the rows. 

Having crossed the estuary of the Shannon, I landed at 
Tarbert, and proceeded by car to Listhowel over a flat, unin- 
teresting, and unprofitable bog. Ballinruddery, the seat of 
the Knight of Kerry, is to the left of the road, and the fine 
wood of his demesne is the most pleasing object throughout 
the journey, and is again seen to great advantage from the 
bridge over the Feale, on leaving Listhowel for Tralee. The 
bog appears to present no impediment to cultivation, and 
why it is left in its present state is unaccountable. 

Leaving Listhowel the country continues for the most part 
flat, and generally cultivated, but in a wretched manner. 
Where the bog remained in its native state, it seemed to 
be rather left for the sake of cutting turfs for burning, than 
from any impediment it offered to the cultivator. The face 
of the country abounds in ruins, some of them very fine ; and 
a round tower of considerable height is visible to the right of 
the road for nearly two hours. The road passes over the 
shoulder of the Stack Hills, and then the view of the town 
and bay of Tralee, with the fine hills beyond, bursts on the 
traveller with great beauty. The principal ferns were Las- 
trcca dilatata, Osmunda regaliH^ and near Tralee Scolopen- 
drium vulgar e and Polystichum acideatum ; and choughs 
and hooded crows the commonest birds. 

Leaving Tralee I ascended the hill south of the town, and 
was delighted to find a lovely little plant which I had never 
before seen growing, — Sibthoi'pia europcea. On the hilly 
land in Ireland you find deep and narrow channels cut by 
torrents of rain water after heavy showers, but, except imme- 
diately after rain, perfectly dry. Spread over the banks, and 
pendant in graceful festoons from the grassy margins of these 
channels, I found the SlbtJiorjiia in the greatest profusion. — 
With a degree of greediness equal to that of the sailor who 
loaded his boat with plunder from a wreck, till the boat and 
the thief went down together, I cut up masses of soil covered 
with this pretty plant, till 1 found myself quite unable to carry 
them, and was compelled to relinquish them one after ano- 
ther, and retained but a solitary specimen. I here found also, 
in the greatest abundance, the dumetorum variety of Lastrcea 
dilatata, and furnished myself with a good supply of roots : 
my first package of this plant, forwarded from Newport and

consigned to Mr. Ward, had never reached him, and I was 
particularly desirous of sending a second supply. On this 
high ground few other ferns made their appearance ; some 
feeble plants of Osmunda, and an occasional Filix-fwmina 
or Filix-mas, with plenty of Lomaria spicant, were all that 
I observed. The heaths, as everywhere else in Ireland, were 
beautiful : the bells of Erica Tetralix were larger, and of a 
brighter and more varied colour than I have ever seen them 
in England 

How my heart leaped within me vrhen I peeped over these 
Tralee hills ! When, after an ascent of five hours, I saw the 
Reeks, Tomies, Carran Tual, Mangerton, Glena, and Turk, — 
names familiar as household words, — and, while their dark, 
empurpled, cloudless summits were relieved against a sky 
of the purest blue, watched the snow-white clouds drifting 
amongst them, passing in front of one huge peak and behind 
another ! I instantly singled out Carran Tual as the highest 
land I had seen in Ireland, but I knew nothing of the others, 
and contented myself with admiring the beauty of the group, 
without making any attempt to ascertain the names of indi- 
viduals. 

On leaving Tralee I had determined on staying that night 
at Cloghereen, and had entrusted my knapsack to the care of 
two gentlemen w^ho w^ere going there in the afternoon by the 
mail-car ; had it not been for this, I believe I should have 
made for " the Reeks" at once, bent my course southward to 
Kenmare, and missed the lakes of Killarney, the mob of 
guides, and Trichomanes speciosiim. It w^as a long struggle, 
but the knapsack and Trichomanes gained the day, and I 
began to descend the hill towards the most celebrated of all 
touring localities, with anything but anticipations of pleasure, 
for I really hate touring-places, and touring people, and tour- 
ing guides : however, I resolved to face it, and so forthwith 
put myself in order to see the lions of Killarney. Having 
made up my mind I began to descend from the heights, and 
it was really a fine walk ; the beautiful mass of Kerry hills 
shut out the horizon, and that dark, grove-like, mountain- 
locked basin at their feet, contained the lakes which were 
weekly visited by hundreds of felicity -hunters. Throughout 
the walk I fouiid abundance of the dumetormn variety of 
Lastraea dilatata, and many other forms of the same plant, 
but I could not quite satisfy myself that they merged in one 
another. Osmunda regalisy not abundant ; Pteris, still less 
common ; Asplenium Adiantum-nigrum, Aspl. Ruta-mura- 
ria, and Aspl. Trichomanes, on walls and ruins ; and, ap- 
proaching Killarney, PolysHchum aculeatumy Lastrcea Filix

mas, and Athyrium Fllicc-foemina, in the greatest abundance. 

When you approach Killarney you find yourself shut in 
between enormous stone walls, which totally preclude the 
possibility of seeing anything of the scenery. These walls 
occur on all the roads in the neighbourhood, and make them 
anything but picturesque ; and Killarney itself is a large, dull 
and dirty town, and one which a traveller would never sus- 
pect was situated amidst the most celebrated scenery in the 
British dominions. 

Cloghereen, an hour's walk beyond Killarney, is merely a 
dozen houses, the best of which is an inn. Almost opposite 
to the inn is an entrance to the demesne of Muckruss, and 
the old abbey is within ten minutes' walk. The abbey is a 
very beautiful object ; it is in excellent preservation, the roof 
alone being wanting, and the walls are covered with a dra- 
pery of fems, among which Scolopendrliim vulcfare is the 
most abundant and conspicuous ; it is surrounded by fine fo- 
rest trees of the most beautiful growth : here also was the 
Arhutus Unedo growing in a state of nature, mingled with 
holly and yew^, and forming the most beautiful natural shrub- 
bery I have ever beheld. The rocky ground below was car- 
peted with mosses, intermixed with the most luxuriant tufts 
of Scolopendrium vulgare, which here assumes a character 
I had never before seen ; ten or twenty very long fronds ema- 
nate from a common centre, and each is bent in a graceful 
semicircle. Here also Polypodium viilgare grows to an im- 
mense size, and runs into those luxuriant excesses in which 
the piimce become again divided, and its normal form is alto- 
gether lost : and here Hypericum calycinnm grows with all 
the vigour of a native plant, and, if introduced, as some bo- 
tanists assert, it has made its footing so secure that I much 
doubt the ability of man to eradicate it. Passing through 
this little paradise you stand on the bank of Lough Lane, the 
largest and most beautiful of the lakes of Killarney. A boat, 
with rowers, steersman, and bugleman was in waiting, and in 
a few minutes I was floating over its placid waters, the wood- 
ed heights of Glena and the purple summit of Tomies rising 
immediately before me. 

Lough Lane covers an area of 5,000 English acres, and 
contains twenty-four named islands ; the largest of these, — 
Ross Island, — contains 150 English acres, and is laid out in 
a tasty manner by its proprietor. Lord Kenmare, who allows 
all visitors to land, and wander about its beautiful shrubber- 
ies just as they please. Ross Castle, on this island, is a fine 
old building covered with ivy, and the visitor is expected to 
ascend to its summit, from whence the view is very beautiful. 

I 3

The mixture of the foliage of holly, arbutus, and yew, with 
the rugged moss- or lichen-stained rocks, is different from 
what one sees elsewhere. Embarking again, the boat coasted 
along Koss Island, the bugleman extracting some fine echoes 
from the ivied walls of the old castle, the wild ducks continu- 
ally flying off the water before us, and circling high above us 
in the air, and dozens of corvorants, squatted on their tails, 
watching our movements from the naked little rocks which 
just peep above the surface of the water. We passed between 
the islands of Ross and Innisfallen, and either my vision had 
been long unaccustomed to trees, or those on Innisfallen, par- 
ticularly the ash and holly, were unusually majestic in size 
and beautiful in figure. Indeed it looked like a fairy island 
raised by magic out of the placid water ; and I cannot much 
wonder at the strange legends of O'Donohue and his milk- 
white steed, which are so implicitly believed, that an Irish 
maiden fell in love with the imaginary chieftain, and actually 
plunged into the crystal waters of Lough Lane, in hopes that 
after death, her spirit might meet with his ; this tale sug- 
gested one of Moore's sweetest melodies. — 

" Of all the fair months that round the sun, 8cc." 

But the wooded heights of Tomies are paying back the 
notes of Gandsey's bugle ; so — 

" Sweet Innisfallen, fare thee well ! 

And long may light around thee smile 
As soft as on that ev'ning fell 

When first I saw thy fairy isle ! 

Thou wert too lovely then for one 

Who had to turn to paths of care ; 
Who had through vulgar crowds to run 

And leave thee bright and silent there." 

Landing again where the huge buttresses of Tomies moun- 
tain, densely covered with birch, oak, arbutus, holly, and yew, 
come down to the edge of the lake, I made my way to O'Sul- 
livan's cascade, in hopes of finding on its shady and moss- 
covered rocks the rare Tricliomanes^ but I was disappointed. 
Abundance of Hipnenophylliim, intermixed with luxuriant 
mosses, covered every stone ; and the most graceful form of 
LastrcBa dilatata waved its feathery fronds from every crevice 
where it could find a footing, and every plant had its pin- 
nules crisped and concave, giving it that appearance which 
Mr. Babington has elsewhere noticed. Here I will take leave 
of the lake for a short time, and ascend the mountains. 

The mountains of this district appear to be divided into 



NOTES ON IRISFI NATURAL HISTORY. 71 

three principal ranges, and certainly possess, beyond all com- 
parison, the most elevated points in the island. The first of 
these ranges is considerably to the west of Lough Lane ; it 
extends almost to Cahirsiveen in Dingle Bay, and is called 
Macgillicuddy's Reeks ; Carran Tual, the highest point of 
these, being 3,400 feet above the level of the sea. The se- 
cond range is also to the west of the lakes, and immediately 
between them and the Reeks, being separated from the latter 
by an opening called the Gap of Dunloe ; this range is called 
the Tomies, and includes the Purple Mountain and Glena. — 
The third range is to the south-east of the lakes, and is usu- 
ally denominated the Turk Range ; its highest points are 
Mangerton and Turk. On all these mountains that rare and 
beautiful animal, the red deer, exists in his native freedom ; 
and is said to feed on a species of lichen which is here very 
abundant. I was told that on Turk herds of several hundreds 
were occasionally seen. It is thought strange that this fine 
animal will not breed in parks and enclosures ; but when we 
recollect that in a state of nature he only frequents the sum- 
mits of the barest mountains, and possesses unbounded free- 
dom ; — that restraint to him is like the chain to the eagle, an 
indignity his proud heart cannot brook; — that in confine- 
ment he becomes fretful, impatient, and savage; — we can 
scarcely wonder that he fails to propagate his kind, and lives 
always hating and generally hated by the creatures wi.h 
whom he may chance to come in contact. Very great pains 
have been taken in Kerry to preserve the red deer, but it is 
found that their numbers are fast decreasing. Lord Bantry 
has paid great attention to them at his seat on Bantry Bay, 
where everything has been done to secure them from moles- 
tation ; but for some years not a single fawn has been ob- 
served. I saw a noble stag on his lordship's estate, a few 
days after leaving Killarney ; it w^as at some distance, and I 
at first took it for a bay horse quietly browzing on the moun- 
tain-side. The horns and heads of red deer which adorn 
Lord Bantry's residence, w^ould furnish half the museums in 
the kingdom. A head, placed over the entrance, is consider- 
ably larger than that of a donkey ; which would imply the 
possession of a body nearly twice as large as that of the quad- 
ruped from Jerusalem. Several of the noblemen and gentle- 
men round Killarney have attempted to rear the red deer in 
their enclosures, by taking them when very young; but it is 
next to impossible to effect the capture of a fawn, without 
doing it some mortal injury : a heavy blow with a stick or a 
stone will so injure one of the delicate little creatures, that it 
frequently dies in consequence of the wound. Still, however, 



72 NOTKS ON lillSIl NATUKAL HISTORY. 

several instances have occurred, in which fawns have been 
secured without injury, and if they survive the period of suck- 
ing, they are sure to do well, althougli never sufficiently re- 
conciled to captivity to encrease their kind. 

It was through the Gap of Dunloe that I now took my 
course, having heard its sublimity mightily extolled, but I 
cannot say I think it would pay for the trouble of exploring, 
unless to those who are unacquainted with the wilder parts 
of Wales and Scotland ; for the pass is thronged with guides, 
and it is a sheer impossibility to address a single observation 
to a companion, without receiving a reply from at least half 
a dozen of these familiar Milesians. At the top of the Gap 
I rested awhile in the cottage of the celebrated Kate Kearney, 
and from her own hand 1 received the cup of poteen and goat's 
milk, — a very comforting mixture. After reaching the sum- 
mit of the gap I turned to the left, and seeing below me the 
cottage at the end of the upper lake, I abandoned the path, 
and pursued my w^ay towards the lake in a tolerably di- 
rect line, over the trackless waste. All over the side of the 
mountain Ping aicula grand ijlora occurs in great abundance : 
its flowers were generally gone, but some were even yet re- 
maining, and struck me as very beautiful. I believe botanists 
do not agree as to the value of this species, but to me it ap- 
peared distinct: I should however mention that not having 
the commoner species [Ping, vulgaris) at hand, I had no op- 
portunity of comparing them. 

At the extremity of the upper lake a boat was in waiting, 
and T once more embarked. The upper lake looks small 
compared with Lough Lane, but is said to cover an area of 
1000 English acres : the little rocky islets rising from it are 
very beautiful. Leaving this lake the rowers entered a rapid 
river connecting it with Loughs Lane and Turk, and having 
reached a fine bold cliff called " the Eagle's Nest," pulled to 
the opposite shore, and we landed in order to hear to greater 
advantage the extraordinary echo for which this spot has long 
been famous. A tune played by the bugleman standing op- 
posite the cliff, has the effect of a duet. Whether it be pos- 
sible to produce a duet by merely causing a repetition of a 
Jirst^ I must leave the scientific to decide, but so it appeared 
to me. Indeed the echoes in many parts of these lakes seem 
perfectly magical. But I am forgetting the ferns. After 
leaving the Eagle's Nest, Osmunda regaliH completely fringes 
the banks of the river between the lakes, and forms a pro- 
minent feature in this most lovely scenery. So altered is the 
usual character of this fern, that its long fronds arch grace-

while the saiicy coots, from beneath the canopy it affords 
them, gaze fearlessly on the visitors who are continually pass- 
ing by. One of the boatmen employed by Sir Walter Scott, 
on the occasion of his visit to Killarney, told me that Sir Wal- 
ter uttered scarcely a syllable in praise of the scenery, until 
he came to this spot ; and here he stopped the rowers, and 
exclaimed, " 77/^9 is worth coming to see ! " The boatman 
evidently thought very meanly of Sir Walter's opinion, whom 
he considered in duty bound to be in raptures with the lakes 
and mountains. I do not wonder at the great man's taste : 
to me it was the most w^onderfully beautiful spot I had ever 
beheld, and this beauty is mainly owing to the immense size 
and number of these pendant fronds. I now approached 
Dinas Island, on which, I believe, stand some of the largest 
arbutus trees in the world. The .stem of one of them is seven 
feet in circumference, and its height is equal to that of an ash 
tree of the same girth which stands near it. There are seve- 
ral others closely approaching this in size. The arbutus, in 
a state of nature, possesses but a distant resemblance to the 
trim, formal, bush-like figure which it assumes in cultivation. 
The branches are very long, gnarled, crooked, and naked to 
the extremity, where they are crowned with bright green 
leaves. They seem particularly fond of the fissures of rock, 
and, like the holly and yew, with which they are ever inter- 
mixed, flourish most where there is least appearance of soil 
to support them. 

In this river-scenery the silvery stem and feathery foliage 
of the birch, and the picturesque figure of the oak and ash, 
are not to be overlooked ; nor should the white water-lilies, 
floating on the stream, nor the multitudes of mosses, nor the 
rich bells of Erica cinerea, be passed by without a notice. — 
Passing to the left of Dinas Island, the rowers pulled into 
Turk Lake, a beautiful sheet of water occupying an area of 
rather more than 1000 acres, with scarcely an island to inter- 
rupt the uniformity of its surface. On the right, the woods 
of Turk Mountain come down to the water's edge. This fine 
lake is separated from Lough Lane by a narrow strip or neck 
of land, and through this is a small opening, over which is 
thrown a bridge, called " Brickeen Bridge." We passed un- 
der the bridge into Lough Lane, and steering to the right, 
the rowers rested on their oars in the cove of Glena. Here 
is a cottage belonging to Lady Kenmare, and its tasty archi- 
tecture, its beautiiul flowers, its green lawns, its sweet ac- 
companiments of wood, rock, and water, — render it a spot of 
uncommon loveliness. From this little cove the boatmen 
pulled across to Muckruss, passing O'Donohue's horse. This

curious rock has so precisely the appearance of a huge horse 
standing on the surface of the water, with his head down, as 
though grazing or drinking, that it seems almost impossible 
to get rid of the illusion; as we approached it, however, it 
proved very rock-like, and seven corvorants flew off, and 
skimmed in a line along the surface of the water to some lit- 
tle rocks we had just before passed. After leaving the horse 
I soon landed, and returned for the night to Cloghereen. 

I next paid my respects to Turk waterfall. Owing to an 
excess of rain the fall was really very striking, — far more so 
than 1 had expected to find it : it was a continuous sheet of 
foam. I first found Tricliomanes speciosuni to the left of the 
seat whence visitors take the first view of the fall. About 
fifteen yards higher up the stream, the rocky bank projects 
into the river; the projection is only to be approached by 
leaping from stone to stone, along the bed of the torrent, 
which, in times of flood, as happened to be the case when I 
paid it this visit, is rather an exciting and ticklish operation. 
You are so close to the fall as to be covered by the spray, and 
the roar is almost deafening. Having reached the projection, 
the botanist must ascend it by means of the roots and branch- 
es, — a feat very readily performed, and there is a little j)lat- 
form at the top, where he can stand very comfortably ; and 
while so standing, he will find the rocky bank, just on a level 
with his eye, completely clothed with Trichomanes, the dark 
green fronds hanging heavily down, dripping with wet, and, 
if the sun happen to shine, begemmed with sparkling drops. 
It is a beautiful sight, and well worth the wet feet, which, 
when the flood is on, form a necessary accompaniment 
of the expedition. The scenery around is well worthy the 
rare fern which it cherishes in its bosom. The rhizoma of 
this fem is black, velvety, tough, and remarkably long : it 
formed a kind of network on the perpendicular surface of the 
rock, in which its roots had no kind of hold : this was the 
character of the plant when most luxuriant, but I found other 
and much smaller plants, which possessed more root and less 
rhizoma^ and the roots were fixed in a thin layer of moist 
earih, among a profusion of moss and Hymenop}iyllum. 

At this waterfall, and again in various localities along the 
road winding towards Kenmare, 1 found both species oi Hy- 
nienophyllum growing together in the greatest luxuriance and 
profusion, sometimes on rocks, and sometimes clothing the 
stems of oak trees to the height of three or four feet from the 
ground. 

In walking under Turk Mountain on my way to Kenmare, 
I found Asplenium marinum in considerable abundance, to

the left of the road, on a rock which appeared to have been 
blasted but a few years back. It was of small size and some- 
what unusual form, and 1 consider the habitat worthy of no- 
tice, as being so completely inland. The plant grows at a 
considerable height on the cliff, and, except to a practised 
eye, would have the appearance of Ceterach officinarum. — 
The site of this fern is near a tunnel of rock, through which 
the road passes. The walk here is very fine ; the arbutus 
trees are most ornamental and of large size : I measured the 
trunk of one that was lying by the road-side, and found it four 
feet nine inches in circumference. Robertsonia umbrosa, or 
the plant which I have taken for it, is very abundant both 
here and at the Gap of Dunloe. 

The ferns which I met with at Killarney are these. Lo- 
maria spicatit, Pteris aquilina, Polypodium vulgare, Poly- 
sticJnim aculeatuni, Lastrasa Oreopieris, Las. Filix-nias, Las. 
dilatata, Athyrium Filix-JoBmina, Aspleniuin Adia7itiim-ni' 
grum, Asp. Ruta-muraria, Asp.marinum, Asp. Trichomas es, 
Scolopendriurn vulgare, Ceterach officinarum^ Trichomanes 
speciosum, Hymenophyllum Timbridgoise, Llym. Wilsoni, 
and Osmunda regalis : and to these Mr. Mackay has added 
Lasircea TJielypteris. Polypodium Dryopteris and Phegop- 
teris, ferns which delight in regions like these, 1 was unable 
to discover.

ADDITIONAL SPECIES OF Till: (iKNU.S KgUUS. 81 



Art. V — Notice of some additional species of the genus Equus, 
to those currently admitted by Zoologists. B}' Edward Blyth, 
Esq. 

It is to be lamented that since the establishment of periodi- 
cals exclusively devoted to particular departments of scientific 
enquiry, some systematic record has not been regularly pub- 
lished, of the scattered items of information which inciden- 
tally but continually appear in the narratives of travellers, 
and in other works of a general character. Valuable hints 
are frequently lost, or perhaps only met with when their uti- 
lity in promoting investigation shall have been superseded, 
by the fortuitous re-discovery of the facts long previously in- 
dicated, and which might have been sought for and re-ascer- 
tained much earlier, had some such record been adopted. — 
Quotations of short passages, and references to such as are 
less conveniently transferrible, would unquestionably, in pro- 
portion as they keep pace with the progress of publication, 
and are extracted from works unlikely to pass into the hands 
of the class which they most concern, exert a highly benefi- 
cial influence on the progress of knowledge, and would obvi- 
ate the tiresome necessity now imposed upon those who hap- 
pen to be engaged on any particular science, of wading through 
volume after volume in pursuit of casual observations. 

This idea has just forcibly occurred to me, on looking over 
my memoranda for some details on the species of Equus, 
which are probably much more numerous than is currently 
supposed, as the following extracts will show. Six sj)ecies 
only are admitted by Cuvier, or four besides the horse and ass, 
which latter I need not here treat of Three of them are well- 
known inhabitants of South Africa, remarkable for their striped 
skins; viz. — 

1. The Quagga [Equus quagga, Gmelin), so named from 
its barking voice, and at one time supposed to be the female 
zebra. It is termed " Wild Horse " in the Cape colony, and 
is indeed the most horse-like, in figure and action, of all the 
species with callosities on the fore-limbs only, though still 
essentially asinine in its details. The head and ears are re- 
markably like those of a horse; and it has stripes on the neck, 
hind-head, and fore-part of the body only, becoming obsolete 
behind. This animal has not been observednorthward of the 
Gariep river, and associates ver\" much with the common or 
w^hite-tailed gnoo. Some years ago a pair of them were 
frequently seen drawing a curricle about the parks ol' London.

2. The Douw^ [Equus Burchellil of some, or better, Eq. 
cristatris ; Eq. zebra of Burchell ; erroneously referred by 
Cuvier to Eq. montana of Burchell). Colour of a pale ass, 
marked with broad blackish stripes, and generally narrower 
and fainter intermediate ones on the neck and body, but none 
on the limbs of the adult ; the mane forming a high crest be- 
tween the ears ; the face more completely striped than in the 
true zebra, the stripes terminating in a blackish muzzle. — 
This handsome species was first indicated as " a curious 
cream-coloured quaccha " in the Journal of the expedition 
into the interior of South Africa which was accompanied by 
the artist Daniell, and which is appended to Sir J. Barrow's 
* Voyage to Cochin China' (page 410) ; it being afterwards 
stated (page 415) that "the whole body is covered with dark 
brown stripes," which differentiate it from the " Isabelline Ze- 
bra" of Le Vaillant.^ It chiefly inhabits northward of the 
Gariep, and associates with the brindled gnoo {Catohlepas 
taiirinus and gorgon). 

3. The Zebra {Eqitus Zebra, Lin. ; Eq. montana, Bur- 
chell). The confusion of the names of these animals by Dr. 
Burchell, was long since pointed out by Mr. .1. E. Gray, in 
the * Zoological Journal,' vol. i. page 241 ; the present one 
being the mountain species, and distinguished by its admira- 
bly regular stripes extending quite down to the hoofs. It is 
diffused from the Cape colony to Guinea, Congo, and even 
Abyssinia, according to Ludolff; while Bruce also mentions 
that " the zebra is found nowhere in Abyssinia, except in the 
south-west extremity of Kuora amid the Shangalla and Galla, 
in Narea and Caff, and in the mountains of Dyre and Tegla, 
and thence to the southward." — ^ (Travels, vol. iv. p. 522). It 
is the Wilde-Paarde of the Cape colonists : and two or three 
individuals which have been broken in by the celebrated 
equestrian, Ducrow, entirely lost their spirit and vivacity in 
consequence, assuming the humbled bearing of the common 
donkey. 

Bruce also states, in the same place, — "Wild asses I have 
frequently seen alive, but never dead : in neck, head, face and 
tail, very like ours, only their skins are streaked, not spot- 
ted [.?]." I do not remember that lliippell anywhere mentions 

' Pronounced like the first syllable of dower. 
'^\x\ the same narrative (page 400) occurs a distinct notice of the recently 
cstahlished Rhinoceros Kvtloa of Dr. Andrew Smith, which is described by 
the name of Jeckloa. " It measured from the head to the root of the tail, 
10 feet 7 inches, and its height exceeded 5 feet inches. But its size was 
less a subject of remark than the peculiarity of its horns, which were pretty 
nearly of the same length." 



OF THE GENUS EQUUS. 83 

the occurrence of wild Equi in that country ; but it is not 
unlikely that a fourth species is here indicated by Bruce, 
which remains to be established by future observers. 

The next quotation is from Bell's ' Travels in Tartary,' vol. 
i. chap. iii. p. 224 ; " Journey from Tomsky to Elimsky, in 
the country of the Tzulimm Tartars." — "Here are also wild 
asses. I have seen many of their skins. They have, in all 
respects, the head, tail, and hoofs of an ordinary ass; but their 
hair is waved, white and brown, like that of a tiger ^ This 
comparison would lead us to believe that they are striped ; 
and it should be remembered that the common ass, aborigi- 
nally an Asiatic species, has frequently distinct stripes upon 
the legs when very young. Bell adds — " There is, besides, 
a number of wild horses, of a chestnut colour, which cannot 
be tamed, though they are caught when foals. These horses 
differ in nothing from the common kind in shape, but are the 
most watchful creatures alive. One of them waits always on 
the heights, to give warning to the rest; and, upon the least 
approach to danger, runs to the herd, making all the noise he 
can ; upon which all of them scud away, like so many deer. 
The stallion drives up the rear, neighing, biting, and kicking 
those which do not run fast enough. Notwithstanding their 
w^onderful sagacity, however, these animals are often sur- 
prised by the Kalmucks ; who ride in among them, well 
mounted on swift horses, and kill, them with broad lances. — 
Their flesh they esteem excellent food, and use their skins to 
sleep upon instead of couches." 

The preceding paragraph to that just cited, in the same 
work, is especially interesting, as containing a distinct notice 
of the aurochs, ( 13os caiicasica ? ) which I am surprised has 
been overlooked by naturalists who have sought for traces 
of the European bison in Asia : that the Caucasian animal, 
however, which this would probably be, is a distinct spe- 
cies, I think ( with Dr. Weissenborn), extremely probable. ^ 
" On the hills, and in the woods near this place, are many 
sorts of wild beasts ; particularly the urus, or uhr-ox, one of 
the fiercest animals the world produces. Their force is such, 
that neither the wolf, bear, nor tiger, dares to engage with 
them." This of course cannot be the gaour, or Asseel Gayal, of 
India ; of which latter, I may remark, there is a skull in the 
Museum of the United Service Club, said to be from the south of 

' In the Catalogue of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, 
London, a bison's skull (that of a young female, and the only portion of 
this animal that I know of in London), is marked — " Habitat the forests of 
southern Russia in Asia, the Caucasian and Carpathian mountains, &c."

China. Bell continues, — " In the same woods is found another 
species of oxen, called Buhul by the Tartars [obviously the 
yack]. It is not so large as the urus ; its body and limbs are 
very handsome ; it has a high shoulder and flowing tail, with 
long hair growing from the rump to its extremity, like that of 
a horse. Those which I saw were tame, and as tractable as 
other cattle." But to return to the Equi. 

The Djigguitai {Eqinis hemionus, Pallas), a well-known 
Asiatic species, with a broad, dark, mesial stripe down the 
back, widening upon the croup ; and which undoubtedly is 
extensively diffused, though at present much confounded with 
others. Such is 

The Khur, or wild ass of Persia, so celebrated for its fleet- 
ness ; and observed near Mount Taurus by Mr. Ainsworth 
('Travels in Assyria, Babylonia, and Chaldea,' page 41). — 
The most detailed notice occurs in Sir R. Ker Porter's Tra- 
vels (vol. i. page 459), where there is also a coloured figure 
of the animal. "The sun was just rising," observes Sir Ro- 
bert, "over the summits of the eastern mountains, when my 
greyhound suddenly darted off in pursuit of an animal, which 
my Persians said, from the glimpse they had of it, was an an- 
telope. I instantly put spurs to my horse, and, with my at- 
tendants, gave chace. After an unrelaxed gallop of full three 
miles, we came up with the dog, who was then within a short 
stretch of the creature he pursued ; and to my surprise, and, 
at first, vexation, I saw it to be an ass. Upon a moment's 
reflection, however, judging from its fleetness that it must be 
a wild one, a creature little known in Europe, but which the 
Persians prize above all other animals as an object of chase, 
I determined to approach as near to it as the very swift Arab 
I was on would carry me. But the single instant of check- 
ing my horse to consider, had given our game such a head of 
us, that notwithstanding all our speed we could not recover 
our ground on him. I, however, happened to be considera- 
bly before my companions, when, at a certain distance, the 
animal in its turn made a pause, and allowed me to approach 
within pistol-shot of him. He then darted off again with the 
quickness of thought ; capering, kicking, and sporting in his 
flight, as if he were not blown in the least, and the chase were 
his pastime. 

" He appeared to me to be about ten or twelve hands high; 
the skin smooth, like a deer's, and of a reddish colour ; the 
belly and hinder parts partaking of a silvery grey; his neck 
was finer than that of a common ass, being longer, and bend- 
ing like a stag's ; and his legs beautifully slender : the head 
and ears seemed large in proportion to the gracefulness of 



OF THE GENUS EQUUS. 85 

these forms, and by them I first recognised that the object of 
my chace was of the ass tribe. The mane was short and 
hlack, as was also a tuft which terminated his tail. No line 
whatever ran along Jtis hack, or crossed his shoulders, as are 
seen in the tame species with us. When my followers of the 
country came up, they regretted that I had not shot the crea- 
ture when he was within my aim ; telling me that his flesh is 
one of the greatest delicacies in Persia. The prodigious 
swiftness and peculiar manner with which he fled across the 
plain, coincided exactly with the description that Xenophon 
gives of the same animal in Arabia, (vide Anabasis, book i.). 
But above all, it reminded me of the striking portredt drawn 
by the author of the book of Job. 

" I was informed by the mehmendar, who had been in the 
desert, when making a pilgrimage to the shrine of Ali, that 
the wild ass of Irak Arabi differs in nothing from the one I 
had just seen. He had observed them often, for a short 
time, in the possession of the Arabs, who told him the crea- 
ture was perfectly untameable. A few days after this dis- 
cussion, we saw another of these animals ; and pursuing it 
determinedly, had the good fortune, after a hard chace, to kill 
it and bring it to my quarters. From it I completed my sketch." 

Allied to the khur, would seem to be the " Isabelline Ze- 
bra" of Le Vaillant, observed by that author in large herds in 
southern Africa, but met with by no subsequent traveller. — 
" It was only under the twenty-fifth parallel," he states, "that 
I found a kind of wild ass, of an isabelline or pale yellow co- 
lour. This animal is, by the Greater Namaquas, styled the 
TVhite Zebra ; but it is certainly a wild ass, for, instead of 
having a striped skin like the zebra, it is of one colour, which 
has a yellow tinge. -No animal in all Africa, perhaps, is so 
suspicious and so shy as this kind of ass. It appears every- 
where in large herds ; but I could never get near enough to 
fire at any of them. I have, however, in my possession, a 
skin, which was employed to cover the hut of a savage."' 
It is remarkable that there is here, also, no mention of a me- 
dian dorsal stripe. 

Col. Hamilton Smith, in his notice of the isabelline ante- 
lope (Redunca isahellina), suggests that — " It may be asked 
here if the female of this animal can have been mistaken by 
M. Vaillant for a kind of wild Equus, which he designates as 
an Isabella-coloured zebra. As the gallop of the preceding 
species [Red. fulio-rufula, H. Smith), is said to resemble the 
action of a horse, the mistake may have occurred when the 

» * New Journey,' English Translation, iii. page 34, 



86 ADDITIONAL SPECIES OF THE GENUS EQUUS. 

creature was seen at a distance." ' To this it may be repli- 
ed, that the very inferior size of the isabelline antelope, the 
non-gTegarious habits of its group — at least to any extent, 
and above all, the matured judgment of so experienced an 
observer as Le Vaillant (who even possessed a mutilated sldn, 
that would have enabled him to correct a hastily-formed opin- 
ion, for the shaggy coat of a Redunca is widely different from 
that of an Equus), alike concur to negative the conjecture. 

The last animal I have to mention is a wild Equus of the 
Eastern Himmalayas. In Moorcroft's * Travels in the Him- 
malayan Provinces ' (Residence at Ladakh, vol. i. page 311), 
we read, — " In the eastern parts of this country is a non-de- 
script wild variety of horse, which I may call Equus kiang. 
It is, perhaps, more of an ass than a horse, but its ears are 
shorter [they are long in Eq. liemionus\ and it is certainly 
not the Gurkhor, or wild ass of Sindh. Its activity and 
strength render its capture difficult." He afterwards nar- 
rates (page 443), — *' We saw many large herds of the kiang, 
and I made various attempts to bring one down, but with in- 
variably ill success. Some were wounded, but not sufficiently 
to check their speed, and they quickly bounded up the rocks, 
where it was impossible to follow. They would afford ex- 
cellent sport to four or five men well mounted, but a single 
individual has no chance. The kiang allows his pursuer to 
approach no nearer than five or six hundred yards ; he then 
trots off, turns, looks, and waits until you are almost within 
distance, when he is off again. If fired at, he is frightened, and 
scampers off altogether. The Chan-than people sometimes 
catch them by snares, sometimes shoot them. From all I 
have seen of the animal, I should pronounce him to be nei- 
ther a horse nor an ass. His shape is as much like that of 
the one as of the other ; but his cry is more like braying than 
neighing. [That of the Djigguitai is a curious compound of 
both]. The prevailing colour is a light reddish chestnut; 
but the nose, the under part of the jaw and neck, the belly 
and legs, are white ; the mane is dun and erect ; the ears are 
moderately long ; the tail bare, and reaching a little below 
the hocks ; the height is about fourteen hands. The form, 
from the fore to the hind leg, and feet, to a level with the 
back, is more equal than that of an ass. He is, perhaps, 
more allied to the quagga, but is without stripes, except a 
reported one along each side of the hack to the tail. These 
were distinctly seen in a foal, but were not distinguished in 
the adults,"

REMARKS ON THE TEKTH OF UEPTIMCS. 87 

Here, then, we have notices, more or less distinct, of per- 
haps five species additional to the six which are well known 
(if, indeed, the wild ass can be considered as well known). — 
First, in the African continent, besides the three striped spe- 
cies of the Cape, the striped wild ass of Bruce, as distinguish- 
ed from his zebra ; and, in Asia, the wild ass of Bell, with 
"hair waved, white and brown, like that of a tiger.'''' Then, 
there is the " Isabelline Zebra " of Le Vaillant, of a uniform 
sort of cream colour, with a yellowish tinge ; the Khur of 
Persia and Arabia, also stripeless, but otherwise very like the 
Djigguitai, and which of course is the " wild mule" of the 
ancients ; and finally, the Kiang of Thibet, also, it would 
seem, much resembling the Equus Jiemionus, with an ob- 
scure (?) stripe in the adult, more distinct in the foal, running 
along each side of the back to the tail, and which is moreo- 
ver like the true zebra, a mountain animal, that " bounds up 
the rocks," so as to defy pursuit. The re-publication of these 
notices may possibly lead to the desired investigation. 

Jn conclusion, I would suggest that it would be quite as 
well if geologists, who continually have occasion to speak of 
fossil remains of this genus, were always to mention them 
under the latin name of Equus, instead of the English Horse, 
inasmuch as it is very generally supposed, in consequence of 
the latter term being employed, that the Eq. cahallus is the 
animal so commonly met with in the European superficial 
strata, which there is no reason to suppose is veritably the 
case. ^

Art. VI. — Remarks on the teeth of Reptiles, fro7n the Tilgate Grit 
of Battle and St. Leonard's. By John Edward Lee, Esq. 

The following remarks on the teeth of reptiles from the Til- 
gate grit and clay of Battle and St. Leonard's, may perhaps 
not be unacceptable to you for insertion in the Magazine. 

The fall in the cliif near the church at St. Leonard's, which 
took place last winter, aiTorded an oppoitunrty of examining 
more particularly the stratum which contains the pat(;hes of 

1 We cannot lielp strongly seconding this jndicjous recommendation of 
Mr. Blyth's. The impropriety has most pvubahly originated in the circum- 
stance of the close agreement displayed in the characters of the teeth 
throughout the species of the genus Eqvus. — Ed.

coarse grit. Several teeth and rragineiits of bones were found 
in this irregular layer, but the larger and more perfect bones 
were obtained from the clay bed immediately above the grit. 
This was also the case at Telham, near Battle ; the patches 
of "sea-sand," as it is called by the workmen, are only very 
occasionally met with, but when found, are in general rich in 
organic remains ; they are covered with a thick bed of clay, in 
which large vertebrce, and bones of the crocodile, and proba- 
bly of the iguanodon, are occasionally found ; but the richest 
locality is in the immediate neighbourhood of Battle. A very 
small quarry, which was opened north of the town early last 
spring, has afforded rather an extensive series of teeth, and 
bones of reptiles, fishes, and turtles. These are the principal 
localities in the neighbourhood of Hastings, from which I 
have obtained any considerable number of Wealden fossils. 

I. — Crocodile. Good specimens of the teeth of this animal 
are comparatively rare at St. Leonard's ; but from Telham and 
Battle they may be obtained nearly equal to the largest of 
those from Tilgate forest. At Battle especially, they are par- 
ticularly abundant : in some parts of the bed hardly a stone 
can be broken without exhibiting portions, at least, of these 
teeth ; and the difference in form which may be observed in 
them is very great indeed. Besides those noticed by Dr. Man- 
tell, as probably belonging to two or more species, a variety 
is occasionally found much shorter and thicker than those 
from Tilgate, though in other respects the characters are 
nearly the same : in some cases the length of the perfect tooth 
does not much exceed once and a half its greatest breadth. — 
But the variety to which I particularly wish to draw your at- 
tention, is one which appears to be 'l ^ 
extremely rare ; for 1 had only the 
fortune to obtain two, during the 
past winter : they differ considerably 
from each other, but still have seve- 
ral characters in common, and pro- 
bably belong to the same species. 
There may perhaps be some doubt 
as to whether they ought to be re- 
ferred at all to the crocodile, as 
several of their characters point out 
a connection with the teeth of some 
other saurians ; respecting this, how- 
ever, I leave it for others to decide. There is a tooth figured 
in the 'Ossements Fossiles' of Cuvier, from the muschelkalk 
of Luneville, which, in the length of the fang and partial 
curvature of the upper part of the tooth, bears a very slight 





FROM THE TILGATE GRIT. 89 

resemblance to the larger specimen ; still it appears a dis- 
tinct species. 

Fig. 4, which is drawn of the natural size, represents the 
larger tooth, llie upper portion, which is considerably curved, 
bears all the characters of the common teeth of the crocodile 
from the weal den formation, being deeply striated, and with 
an elevated ridge on each side. The sirice, as usual, all com- 
mence at an equal distance from the point ; a little below the 
line of their commencement, the colour, which, with the ex- 
ception of a light annular streak, had been very dark brown, 
changes, in the rest of the tooth, to a dull white or lead co- 
lour. This light-coloured portion or fang, is double the 
length of the striated or upper part of the tooth : the middle 
portion is, in some measure, inflated, and again contracts to- 
wards the bottom. It should, however, be mentioned, that 
the original specimen is embedded in very hard grit, which 
covers some parts of the inner curve, so that though from the 
appearance of what is exposed, there is little doubt that the 
drawing is correct, yet the exact bend of the inner outline is 
in a small degree assumed : the outer side, however, is clear- 
ly shown, and exhibits a very regular curve almost to the bot- 
tom. The middle part of the tooth is marked with obscure 
longitudinal strice, and is rather flattened at the sides, in ad- 
dition to which, on the upper side, as it lies exposed in the 
stone, there is a slight longitudinal depression. The lower 
part of the tooth is marked by several annular furrows, one of 
which, near the bottom, is very deep and well defined ; the 
other three, of which one is below, and two above, are in- 
distinct, and rather obscure. 

The smaller tooth (fig. 5) is more slender than that just 
described. The outer curve is still more regular, and though 
the middle portion of the tooth is slightly thicker than the 
rest, yet the inner curve follows very closely the character of 
the outer one. The striated portion is rather more than one 
third of the length of the whole tooth. There is no annular 
furrow near the bottom, as in the last specimen, but two very 
indistinct ones just below the commencement of the striated 
portion, and a slight annular depression, rather than a fuiTow, 
about half way up the fang. 

Both these specimens were found in the small quarry near 
Battle. 

TI. — Iguanodon. The teeth of this animal, as found at 
St. Leonard's, arc usually only the stumps, worn down by 
attrition, and in most cases hollowed to mere shells by the 
absorbent action of new teeth. On the contrary, many of 
those which are found at Battle appear to have come fresh

from the jaw ; the serrated edge, in some specimens, is beau- 
tifully perfect, and many of them are nearly equal in size to 
the largest of those from Tilgate Forest. Good specimens, 
certainly, are not common. At the same time I obtained 
from the quarrymen, and by my o^Yn exertions, a series in 
every stage from the perfect tooth to the worn-out stump. 

III. — Megalo'iaurus. The teeth of this animal found at St. 
Leonard's and Battle, cannot by any means vie in magnitude 
with those from Stonesfield : in general they are only about 
half the size, and some of them are still smaller. There is a 
variety occasionally met with, which is shorter, more curved, 
and rather thicker in proportion than those of the usual form; 
it might be a subject of enquiry whether this belongs to a dis- 
tinct species, or be only from a different part of the same ani- 
mal. At St. Leonard's it is of rare occurrence to meet with 
even a fragment of the tooth of a Megalosaurus ; but at the 
small quarry near Battle, before alluded to, they are occasion- 
ally found, though not in any great abundance. 

IV. — Phytosaiirus cylind7'icodon. The teeth which are fi- 
gured by Dr. Mantell, as belonging to this animal, appear to 
be extremely rare throughout the wealden : I met with only 
one at St. Leonard's during the last winter, and from the Bat- 
tle quarry, four or five perfect and imperfect specimens were 
all that could be obtained. They appear to differ slightly 
from those figured by Dr. Mantell; the upper part is rather 
more flattened, and bent inwards, and the whole surface is 
deeply and irregularly wrinkled. All the specimens, like those 
from Tilgate Forest, appear to have been broken short off.

Art. VII. — Remarks on the Skeletons of the common tame Goose, 
the Chinese Goose, and the Hybrid between the two. By T. C. 
Etton, Esq., F.L.S. 

The circumstance of hybrids produced between the tame 
goose and the Chinese goose being again productive, was the 
inducement which led me to make the following examination 
of their respective skeletons, in order to ascertain the degree 
of similarity existing between them. Before however stating 
the results, it may perhaps be as well to mention the mode I 
followed in order render the hybrids productive, which was 
simply the placing together a male and female, of different 
hatches ; though the birds were both young, they reared eight 
young ones. 



ON THE SKKLETUNS OF GKF.SE. 91 

The mode adopted by me in comiting the vertehrce is the 
same as that mentioned in my Monograph on the Aiiafidce, — 
namely, to consider as cervical all the vertebras which are 
anterior to the ribs, and have no attachment to them ; the 
dorsal are those anterior to the peloinal bones, having ribs 
attached to them ; the sacral are those anchylosed together, 
and immediately succeeding the dorsal, to some of these are 
attached either true or false ribs. 

The following table will show the numbering of the verte- 
bral column, as far as I have been able to ascertain it, in the 
birds above mentioned, and also in a variety of the Chinese 
goose. 

Cervical, Dorsal. Sacral. Caudal. 

Tame goose 17 6 16 2 6 

Chinese ditto 17 G 17 2 6 

White variety of ditto. ..17 6 16 3 6 

Hybrid 6 16 2 6 

The second number under the head of sacral vertehrce^ 
denotes those to which ribs are attached ; so that the total 
number in the tame goose for instance, is eighteen. 

It will be seen from the foregoing table, that some differ- 
ence exists in the numbers of the dorsal and sacral vertebr<B 
of the Chinese goose, as given here and in the work above 
mentioned, w^hich is caused by one being taken from the dor- 
sal and added to the sacral. This change I have been indu- 
ced to make, on the examination of a section of the pelvis ; 
the skeleton referred to in the Monograph, is that now spoken 
of as the white variety. I greatly regret, that in consequence 
of some of the cervical vertehroi of the hybrid having been 
lost, I have been unable to give their number with certainty, 
but it is most probably seventeen, both the parent birds pos- 
sessing that number. The caudal vertehrce of the Chinese 
goose were also damaged. 

The sternum of the hybrid bird presents some curious fea- 
tures ; but previously to referring to them, it will be necessary 
to point out the differences between that part in the common 
goose and the Chinese, which are as follows. The tame 
goose has the sternum broader and longer, with the keel deep- 
er, and is altogether larger than that of the Chinese ; it is also 
characterized by a wave or indentation^ in its plane, at about 

^ This feature increases with age. I possess the sternum of a tame goose 
above twenty years old when killed, which shoAvs it much more distinctly 
than that of a young one. The fissures also on the posterior margin are 
closed up, and iorm foramina. 



92 IIEMKWS. 

one third of its length from tlie posterior extremity, possessed 
only in a slight degree by the Chinese. 

The knob situated between the junctions of the coracoid 
bones is also larger in the common goose than in the Chinese. 

The sternum of the hybrid bird is as long as that of the 
tame goose, but not broader than that of the Chinese ; it is 
consequently more elongated than either. The indentation 
or wave in its plane is about the same as that in the Chinese, 
as is also the size of the knob situated between the coracoids. 

The bones of the pelvis in all three are very similar in form, 
but that of the tame goose is the largest and most massive. 
The hybrid differs from either of its parents, in having the 
notch situated on each side of the posterior margin of the 
ilium, merely represented by two slight indentations. 

The cranium of the Chinese differs from that of the com- 
mon goose, in having two tubercles at the base of the bill, 
that part being, on the contrary, depressed in the tame goose. 
The hybrid takes an intermediate form, being only slightly 
elevated. 

The remaining bones do not differ in form in either of the 
three birds mentioned ; in the tame goose, however, they are 
larger than in the Chinese, while those of the hybrid are in- 
termediate between the two. 

From the above brief notes the following deductions may 
be drawn. — That the hybrid possesses characters nearly in- 
termediate betw een its parents, but in one particular varies in 
form from either: and that the most material difference be- 
tween the parents consists in size, and in the numbering of 
the sacral veriehroi ; in the latter particular the hybrid agrees 
with the female parent.

To a person unversed in zoological literature, the various

logical science may be treated, must appear quite useless. —

either not think at all upon, or would ridicule, the researches 
of the anatomical zoologist who, like Swammerdam or Lyon- 
net, would spend years over the investigation of a single spe- 
cies; whilst others, whose observations are directed to the 
study of the habits of the different species, or their relations in 
the great chain of the creation, would be equally thought to 
be following up an amusement having no solid object in view. 
We are not, fortunately, now-a-days called upon to write long- 
essays to prove that all or any of these different views of stu- 
dying nature, are possessed of respective advantages ; neither 
do we feel it necessary to enter into any enquiry whether the 
researches of nomenclaturist, comparative anatomist, natural- 
historian, or natural-classificationist, be entitled to the great- 
est weight. All are leading us on to the same end, — the 
knowledge of nature, — by different routes; and therefore, a 
work like the one whose title stands at the head of this arti- 
cle, is in its way as valuable, in our opinion, as that reviewed 
in the following one, although there is not a single readable 
passage in the work of Mr. Stephens. We are exceedingly 
glad to find that the author has followed the plan of some of 
the best botanical writers, in giving a short abstract of his 
great work, which, from its price, is necessarily in a limited 
number of hands. The volumes of the " Illustrations of Bri- 
tish Entomology " which comprise the beetles, cost nearly 
eight pounds ; whilst here, for little more than one sixteenth 
of that sum, the specific characters, sizes, habitations, and 
periods of appearance, of nearly 3500 species of beetles are 
given to the reader : each page averaging about nine species. 
Short characters of the order, and its primary and secondary 
sections, are first given, which are succeeded by the families 
of the stirpes, and the genera in the respective families. A 
good plan has been adopted in respect to the latter ; all the 
genera in a family being characterized in the same page, in- 
stead of their characters being given at the head of the re- 
spective genera : by this means the student has under his 
eye, at one glance, the whole of the genera in the family, and 
is able far more readily to determine the genus of an insect, 
than if they had been scattered over many pages. The fol- 
lowing description of the first genus and species will show the 
manner in which the characters are given, and which will be 
seen to be sufficient for all practicable uses.

JSfLT. II. — A Treatise on the Insects injurious to Gardeners, Foresters, and 
Farmers. By Vincent Kollar, Curator of the Royal Cabinet of Na- 
tural History at Vienna, and Member of many learned. Societies. Trans- 
lated from the German, and illustrated by Engravings. By J. and M. 
Loudon : with Notes, by J. O. Westwood, F.L.S., &c. London : W. 
Smith. 1840. Sm. 8vo. pp. 377. 

This work is of a totally different character from that of Mr. 
Stephens above described. Impressed wdth the conviction 
that the most likely means of attaining a knowledge of the 
most effectual remedies against the attacks of the various 
species of obnoxious insects, are to be sought for in a know- 
ledge of their respective habits, M. Kollar and his associates. 
Baron Kreigelstein and Canon Schmidberger, have devoted 
their attention to the economy of the different species, and 
the result has been a volume on the history and " Private 
Lives " of about one hundred and twenty-five of the insects 
most obnoxious to vegetation. And we have now to thank 
the Misses Loudon for their careful translation of the w^ork 
from the German, and for the numerous wood- cuts with 
which they have illustrated the text, whereby a better notion 
wdll be obtained of the species. 

To enable the farmer and arboriculturist, — who, of course, 
are not always adepts in scientific classification, — to find more 
easily the insects particularly interesting to each, the families 
and species are not given in any systematic anangement, but 
according to the branch of culture to which they prove most 
injurious. The insects troublesome to sheep and cattle are 
also given, and the w^ork contains a popularly written sketch 
of the principles of entomological science. The translation 
being more especially intended for the agriculturist and gar- 
dener, those chapters in the original work which treated upon 
body insects and house insects are omitted in the translation. 

The following is a sketch of the sections into which the 
translation is divided. 

1. Insects which do not live upon the body, but are troublesome from their 
attacks upon man. 
Insects which live on domestic animals. 

Insects not parasitical, but which sometimes attack domestic animals. 
Insects which injure bees.

2. Insects which injure grain in a growing state, and in the granary.

Insects injurious to culinary vegetables. 

3. Insects which injure the vine. 

Insects which particularly injure greenhouse and hothouse plants. 

Insects injurious to fruit-trees. 

Insects which are destructive to woods and forests. 

From the very neat and cheap manner in which the vohime 
is got up, we trust it will become a favourite, not only with 
the entomologist, but with every lover of agriculture, arbori- 
culture, and horticulture. 



Art. III. — British Entomologt/ : or Illustrations and Descriptions of the 
Genera of Insects found hi Great Britain and Ireland. By John Curtis, 
F.L.S., &c. 16 vol. 8vo., or 192 monthly parts. London : printed for 
the Author. Pigot and Co. 

We congratulate the author upon the completion of this, one 
of the most elegant periodical works which has ever issued 
from the British press. We may likewise congratulate our 
readers on possessing so national, as well as so valuable, a 
production. In the beauty of its figures, and the superior 
style of finish of the colouring, it stands superior to any other 
entomological work yet published ; whilst the anatomical 
outlines will render it a work of constant reference to those 
who do not content themselves with the mere names of species. 
Much however still remains to be done before we possess 
a complete iconographical illustration of the genera of British 
insects. In Mr. Curtis's work very many groups of trivial 
value have been figured, whilst others, types of well-marked 
groups of considerable extent, have been omitted ; indeed we 
would strenuously recommend the author to add another vo- 
lume, in which these omitted groups might be illustrated. — 
Scydmadnufi, Hispa, Sialts, Xiphydria, Attacus, Sphex, Ly- 
rops, Stic/mus, Limacodes, Cilix, Scatopse, AntJwmyia, Calo- 
hata, and many others (as well as all the Ametabolous genera, 
which Mr. Curtis considers as insects), ought to have been 
illustrated ; and even in many of the genera figured, we find 
details omitted upon which the genera are chiefly founded : 
a deficiency evidently originating in the higher value sup- 
posed by the author to be possessed by the trojM, which he 
has accordingly always represented in detail, although, in 
many great groups, they clearly afford but secondary charac- 
ters. The nervures of the wings of the Lepidoptera, and 
their transformations, ought never to have been neglected ;

whilst the structure of the thoracic segments, and of the ab- 
dominal appendages, has not been investigated with that 
precision which was requisite in a work of such high preten- 
sion. In these respects Burmeister's 'Genera Insectorum' 
(which has now reached the fourth number), and the Illus- 
trations of the Crochard edition of the ' Regne Animal,' come 
much nearer to our notions of generic illustration. 

With all these deficiencies, however, the work will stand 
as a lasting memorial of the zeal and untiring energy of its 
author, during the best period of his life. 

Mr. Curtis has announced an Atlas to illustrate all ento- 
mological works, consisting of figures and generic characters 
of the groups not figured in the ' British Entomology,' each 
plate containing four or five genera ; to consist of 200 plates, 
price 6d. each, uncoloured. Thus it will be seen that there 
remain nearly 1000 genera over and above those delineated 
in the Illustrations. We wish Mr. Curtis health to complete 
his announced undertaking, which appears to us capable of 
being rendered even more useful than his former work.

Art. VIII. — A History of the British Ferns. By Edward Newman, 
F.L.S. London: Van Voorst. 1840. Svo. pp. i04. 

It affords us much satisfaction to find Mr. Van Voorst 
extending to the botanical kingdom the circle of scientific 
treatises, in w^hich, as publisher, he has been eminently suc- 
cessful. A History of our Forest Trees is in progress by Mr. 
Selby ; while the work before us, treating on a more lowly 
tribe, — our indigenous Ferns, may vie, though not in bulk, 
yet in intrinsic merit, with the late-published ' Histories ' in 
British Zoology, that have with justice earned so high a re- 
putation. 

Mr. Newman sets outs with a remark, the purport of 
which, if more generally attended to than it has been, would 
prevent so much confusion and discrepancy existing between 
the accounts of different systematic writers on the protean 
tribes of which this volume treats. 

" I think no botanist, who allows his memory to turn to the varieties he 
has observed of Lastrcea dilatata and Polystichum aculeatum, will for a mo- 
ment deny this ; and yet what botanist has ever presumed to treat of the 
cutting of the frond in Ferns as of any other than the highest importance ? 
I entertain a different opinion. I think that mere cutting of frond is of 
no more value than colour in fowls or cows, and therefore should not be 



REVIEWS. 91) 

used as the leading character of a species; to distinguish which, I would 
look for less tickle characters in the figure, position, and covering of the 
masses of seed, in the habit of the rhizoma, and in the general outline of 
the frond." 

The author dilates, at some length, on Mr. Ward's plan of 
cultivating ferns in closed vessels, so as to exclude the very 
free access of air. But, beautiful as are the results arrived at 
by that gentleman, we cannot help thinking that Mr. New- 
man's enthusiastic commendations partake rather of what our 
Gallic neighbours call coulem^ de rose. Certainly, however, 
it is by no means so generally known as it ought to be, how 
very successfully ferns can be cultivated in closed glass jars, 
and that thus our drawing-rooms may readily become deco- 
rated with these most exquisite of Flora's productions. 

" This end is obtained by the use of glass, the light so essential to vege- 
tation being thus freely admitted. The most ready way to try the experi- 
ment is, to procure a glass vessel, for instance, one of those jars used by 
druggists and confectioners ; introduce some soft sandstone, or some light 
soil, filling one-sixth of the jar with it, and taking care that the earth be 
very moist, yet allowing no water to settle at the bottom of the jar ; plant 
a fern in the earth, and then cover the jar with its glass lid, first supplying 
a slip of wash-leather round the rim of the jar, which will pretty nearly 
cut off the communication between the internal and external air ; no far- 
ther attention will be required : the fern will live, thrive, and probably seed, 
the seed also vegetating, and at last the jar will become too small for its 
contents; no watering is needed, the moisture in the earth will exhale, 
condense on the glass, trickle down its sides, and so return to the earth 
whence it arose." 

With regard to the theoretical action of Mr. Ward's closed 
fern-cases, the author seems to doubt whether they have not 
some influence distinct from that of merely excluding soot, 
and thus supplying their vegetable inhabitants with what may 
aptly be called Jiliered air. The experiment cited by Mr. 
Newman, and on which he has based his opinion, that some 
peculiar action is exerted in addition to that alluded to, is by 
no means conclusive ; as it is obvious that the plantules con- 
fined in the moist atmosphere of the phial, would, cceferL^ 
paribus, have a better chance of existing, than those exposed 
to spontaneous evaporation in the atmosphere, — an action, 
against which their feeble vitality could oppose but little 
resistance. 

'* On a hot day in the summer of 1837, I brought home in a tin box: 
about a dozen seedlings of Lastrcea dilatata, which I had picked out of 
moss; each l^ad a single frond of very small size, and extremely minute, 
white, and delicate roots. Having a wide-mouthed phial at hand, I put 
in it a small quantity of very wet earth ; and then passing a pin through 



100 KKVIEWS. 

the single frond of one of tlie seedlings, and pinning it to a cork previously 
covered with wet wash-leather, I fixed the cork firmly in the phial, and left 
the iern hanging at the head of the pin with its roots downwards. Some 
hours afterwards 1 looked at my little fern, and found it exhibited no symp- 
toms of withering; whereas the other seedlings, left carelessly on the ground 
beside the phial, were completely dead, and crumbled to powder between 
the finger and thumb. I hung up the phial by a string to a nail in the 
garden wall, and here it was hanging twelve months afterwards. The 
cork was fastened exactly as I left it, but the phial was filled with some- 
thing green, which, on taking it out, proved to be a plant of the common 
chickweed, but to my great joy the little fern still hung from the pin ; its 
roots were longer, it had made two fronds, and the original frond had wi- 
thered, but was still strong enough to support the fern." 

The value of characters drawn from the venation of ferns is 
very properly alluded to as affording a means of distinguish- 
ing closely-allied genera : an observation moreover deserving 
consideration, from its being generally very distinct in the 
fossil species of this tribe, where the fructification ceases to 
afford a sufficient or tangible guide. 

" Most authors have admitted the importance, for purposes of nomencla- 
ture, of those characters which are spoken of by Smith as derived from the 
fructification ; but, until lately, other characters of equal value, drawn 
from the situation of the veins, have been entirely neglected ; this is now 
no longer the case, and I am inclined to believe, that henceforward, in the 
veins of a new fern will be sought the characters which shall decide its 
genus." 

The illustrations display considerable taste, and what is of 
far greater moment, correctness. The descriptive part of the 
volume is accurately and clearly written, and the list of ha- 
bitats is tolerably copious. The reader will at first be sur- 
prised by the appearance of several old friends under new 
faces, from some alterations of nomenclature introduced by 
Mr. Newman, none of w-hich, how^ever, appear to have been 
made hastily or unnecessarily ; and in no instance has the 
author coined a new name. 

Under Lastrcea dilatata {Nephrodium dilatatum) mention 
is made of the two remarkable varieties of this fine fern, cha- 
racterised by the nearly flat, and the convex recurved fronds. 
There is one curious variety not, however, referred to, which 
grows under some hedges skirting Hampstead Heath, in which 
the frond is often three feet high, and the spores are of a bril- 
liant jet black, the indusia being white : the whole plant, 
whilst drying, evolving an aromatic odour like woodroffe [As- 
perula odorata). 

The closely-allied species of Aspidmm, viz., lobatum, an- 
gulare, and aculeatum^ are very correctly treated of as varie- 
eties of one and the same plant, arising from accidental 



EXTRICATION OF THE IxMAQO IN A CRANE-FLV. lOl 

circumstances connected with soil, situation, &c. ; and Mr. 
Newman is inclined to place Js/). Lonchiiis in this group, as 
a variety also. But although he has adduced many plausible 
reasons in support of his opinion, we believe that few botanists 
will feel inclined to class the sharp and rigid Asp. Lonchiiis 
of the Scotch and Irish mountains, with the remarkable vari- 
ety of Asp. lohatum termed Lonchitioides, which is not un- 
frequently found in the southern counties. We have met 
with Lonchiiis growing in abundance by the side of the 
source of the White-water, terminating the Glen of Dole in 
the Clova mountains, and scattered in patches over the whole 
glen, as far as the terrific cascade of Bach-na-gairn ; but we 
never saw the slightest variation fiom its normal type : it pre- 
served its rigid and even spinous fronds under every variety 
of aspect in the glen of Dole. The most perfect specimens of 
Aspidium lobatum var. lonchitioides we have met with, were 
found in fructification^ in hedges by the side of Buckhurst 
Park, at Withyham, Sussex, close to a farm called Florence ; 
and these, although observed annually during eight years, 
never acquired anything approaching to the rigidity of the al- 
pine plant. This question remains, however, sub judice, and 
is an interesting one for the practical botanist to determine. 

To every lover of British Botany we cordially recommend 
Mr. Newman's volume, and we assure him that to us it is not 
the less welcome as being the production of a professed ento- 
mologist. 



SHORT COMMUNICATIONS. 



Singular mode of extrication of the Imago from the Pupa- 
case in a species of Crane-fly. -My attention was drawn, 
during the autumn, to some dipterous larr(B of a dirty black- 
ish colour, among the roots of some moss which grew upon 
the plastering of the back wall of the house. From one piece, 
about the size of a small marble, which I pulled off, I shook 
out no less than seven of them ; some three quarters of an 
inch in length : when stretched out to their full extent, as 
they were creeping about, their length was nearly an inch. I 
had often noticed them previously, in their peregrinations on 
the glass of the window, a thing not very usual with the larv(B 
of dipterous insects. I tried to rear several during their pupa 
state, but could not succeed. One fine mornin?i^, about the 



102 EXTRICATION OF THE IMAGO IN A CRANE-FLY. 

middle of October, I observed what ap])eared to be the body 
of a small crane-fly, projecting from the moss ; upon examin- 
ing it more closely, 1 found it was an imago disengaging itself 
from the pupa-case, (there was no appearance of a larva-case) : 
the head and thorax were very small, but the abdomen was 
stretched out, and to all appearance quite rigid, being about 
half an inch in length, and one sixteenth in diameter. The 
wings were expanded, and spread out at right angles to the 
body ; the apex of the abdomen was still enclosed within the 
pupa-case ; the legs were not yet extricated from their ea:u- 
vice. The colour of the abdomen was whitish, but, from its 
extreme tenuity, owing to its excessive enlargement, it was 
perfectly transparent, showing the intestinal canal as a very 
dark, fine thread wdthin it. After watching it for some time, 
and not observing any motion, I thought it had died, as the 
previous night had been very cold ; but while I went into the 
house for a knife to detach the moss from the wall, it disen- 
gaged itself, and when I returned was creeping about and 
fluttering its wings, the abdomen remaining distended as be- 
fore. I pricked it with a fine pin, when it instantly shrunk 
to about a line and a half in length, and the thickness of a 
common sewing-thread ; losing its transparency, but not its 
colour, remaining of an opake white for about half an hour, 
when it began to assume its natural hues. On examining the 
wall I found numberless exuvice in positions exactly similar 
to the one above described, and afterwards observed several 
imagoes flying about with the abdomen of the size and colour 
mentioned, not having yet assumed its natural dimensions and 
appearance. In one the abdomen was considerably reduced 
in length, but not in its lateral dimensions ; the cause of so 
unusual a condition I suppose to be owing to the length of 
the legs, which, when stretched out to their full extent, mea- 
sured about nine lines in length. Most other insects make 
use of their legs in extricating themselves from their exuvim ; 
but in this, owing to their length so greatly exceeding that of 
the body, it is evident there must be some other method of 
extrication, which is effected by the elongation of the abdo- 
men. There were numberless small patches of moss on the 
wall, many of them not above a line in extent ; but 1 could 
not find one which was not infested by these larvae, and I 
often saw them, after having devoured the roots of the moss 
where they had been hatched, creeping about in search of 
another habitation. By the end of October they had destroyed 
every vestige of the moss, not one living plant of it being 
found anywhere on the wall, by the most diligent search. —

that may chance to lall in its way, but studiously refusing to 
touch them if dead. I likewise am able to affirm the shed- 
ding of the skin, a fact which I have not seen noticed by na- 
turalists, probably arising from the circumstance of the toad 
hiding itself at the time of the operation, and swallowing the 
skin afterwards. 

In the spring of 1839, the one in my possesson seemed 
in a sickly state, looking thin, and refusing food : one morn- 
ing I found him under an inverted flower-pot, ( in which I 
had cut a hole), evidently in great agony, ( surrounded by a 
pool of fluid excretion, with which the surface of his body 
appeared saturated ), and apparently choaking. I took it in- 
to my hand, and found something hanging from both comers 
of its mouth. I took hold of one portion with my fingers, 
and drew it easily out, which I threw down, but on the remo- 
val of the other piece, I was induced to throw it into water, 
when it expanded, and I found it to be half the skin of the 
animal, even to the very tips of its toes. The toad was of a 
much lighter colour after, than before the operation, and I 
find that invariably its colour changes from dark to light, 
whenever it emerges from its hiding-place. — Johti Bright, —

[We believe that zoologists are indebted to Prof. T. Bell, 
for the first notice of the above curious circumstances which 
accompany the change of skin in the toad, and which are 
fully described in the ' History of British Reptiles,' p. 109. —

Information for Collector's in Natural History. — When in 
Naples last year, I made the acquaintance of a very zealous 
naturalist and collector, who is willing to send to this coun- 
try collections of the productions, in various branches of the 
Natural History of Naples and Sicily, but more particularly 
of the shells, recent and fossil, and insects, either in ex- 
change for the shells, recent and fossil, of Britain, or for 
payment in money. I can testify to his ability and liber- 
ality, and strongly recommend him to the notice of those 
who are desirous of collecting the productions of that inte- 
resting portion of Europe. 

I may add that Mr. Morell is a native of Switzerland, 
and was, for many years, a con'espondent of the well-known 
naturalist, Dr. Leach.

Hint to Ornithologists. — Ha\dng been lately at a meeting 
of scientific friends, where the oft-repeated experiment of 
puncturing the small end of an egg and placing it in an ex- 
hausted receiver, was performed, to show the existence of 
the air globule at the other end, and to illustrate its elasticity, 
it suggested to me a neat mode of preparing eggs for collec- 
tions, without the necessity of making a hole at both ends, 
for the purpose of blowing them in the ordinary manner. — 
The amount of air originally in the q^^ is not sufficient, — 
however well the receiver be exhausted, — to expel the whole 
of the contents ; but if it be exhausted until a portion of the 
albumen fall from the egg, on the re-admission of air, a fresh 
portion will be drawn in. On again removing atmospheric 
pressure, a much larger quantity of the contents will escape, 
nd, by a third or fourth repetition, the whole of the contents 
of the e^^ will be evacuated. By reversing the experiment, 
a little water may be drawn in to wash the inside of the shell, 
and this may be again removed by the former process. By 
these means eggs may be prepared for museums without any 
further disfigurement than a needle puncture at one end, and 
that so small as to be scarcely perceptible. — T. Bell Salter. —

ing through the parcels of British plants received this year, 
for the annual distribution of the Botanical Society of the Lon- 
don, I was not a little surprised to find in the parcel received 
from Mr. Isaac Brown, of Hitchin, Herts, nearly one hundred 
specimens of this rare British plant, found by him in May, 
1839, near Hitchin Common, Herts. I am thus anxious to 
make known this circumstance to metropolitan botanists, as 
I believe it has never been observed within so short a distance 
of London before, and must be looked upon as one of our 
rarest British plants. — Daniel Cooper, Surgeon, Curator

Art. I. — View of the Fauna of Brazil, anterior to the last Geologi' 
cal Revolution. By Dr. Lund.^ 

( Continv£d from page 57 ). 

Next to the bats and rodents the most important family with 
reference to the abundant relics that one species has left in 
the caves, is that of the Marsupials : and of these the Didel- 
phis murinus has been already alluded to, in specifying the 
contents of the heaps of bones introduced by the owls. 

Of the family of Pachydermata, there is one genus in Bra- 
zil {Dicotyles)y the species of which both habitually frequent 
caves, and also use them as places of refuge fi-om their ene- 
mies. T have accordingly remarked their traces in many 
caverns, and have even followed them far into their dark pas- 
sages ; whereas I have only very rarely met with their bones 
there. I have in vain sought for either remains or foot-prints 
of the tapir, whence I conclude that it does not take refuge in 
caves. 

Of Ruminants there is also only one genus in Brazil, that 
of Cei'vus, which contains five species, whereof one, of the 
size of the musk, is undescribed. This animal does not pe- 
netrate into the caverns ; but when their entrances form a 
spacious chamber, its footsteps may be frequently seen there. 
Only in Lappa Nova de Maquine have I discovered the re- 
mains of a single individual of that genus {Cervus rufus), and 
in my account of that cave I have already endeavoured to ex- 
plain the circumstances of its discovery. I will only add here 
that subsequent experience has confirmed me in the opinion 
I there expressed. I have since observed in many caves that 
lay near to the habitations of man, the uninjured skeletons of 
several domestic animals, especially oxen and goats, the exa-

mination of which clearly explained to me the mode of their 
introduction ; namely, that these creatures, whose footsteps I 
had often traced in the mouth of the caverns, had undoubt- 
edly visited them for the purpose of licking the saltpetre, of 
which the crystals cover the surface of the floor ; and that 
they had lost themselves in the labyrinthine passages. 

Of predatory animals there is no existing species that makes 
caves its habitual dwelling-place. I certainly have remarked 
an abundance of the foot-prints of the Couguar [Felis concolor), 
not only at the entrance, but a long way in the interior of ca- 
verns ; but I imagine it only enters them when following the 
track of the wild hog or the paca. That it does not use the 
caves as fixed dens, I presume from the fact that I have never 
found the animal itself, nor the remains of its meals there, 
while I have often had opportunities of seeing them in the 
woods, even in the immediate vicinity of caves. 

The two remaining orders, the Edentata and Quadrumana, 
do not enter into the question here, forasmuch as I have not 
hitherto found the slightest trace of them in the Brazilian 
caverns. However, the imperfect state of our knowledge re- 
specting the first of these orders, together with the important 
part they have played here in a former age, compel me to 
take a cursory survey of the species of this class which now 
inhabit this part of the New World. It is divided into the 
three natural families of the armadilloes, the ant-bears, and 
the sloths. I shall commence with the most numerous, and 
the most difficult, the armadilloes. 

The unfortunate idea of founding the determination and 
nomenclature of the species of this family on the different 
number of the bands, has introduced such confusion into their 
natural history, that most later authors have recognized the 
necessity of beginning de novo the systematic arrangement of 
these animals. In consequence of these attempts some of the 
previous confusion has been removed ; but at the same time 
new errors, in my opinion, threaten to creep in, as long as 
naturalists will continue to determine these very variable crea- 
tures, from individuals kept in collections. In this district of 
Brazil there are found four species of this family ; of which 
by far the most abundant is the Dasypus lotigicaudus, Pr. 
Max. On account of its universal occurrence it is called by 
the Brazilians, the " Tatu-verdadeiro," ^. e. the true or proper 
Tatu ; which indeed is nothing more than a translation of its 
Indian name, Tatu-ete, which has the same signification. — 
Marcgraaf has given a very good description of this species, 
and under its right names, Tatu-ete, Tatu-verdadeiro ^(p.231), 
but by a blunder of the binder, the wood engraving repre- 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 107 

senting this species (which by the way is not original, but 
borrowed from Clusius, and very poor), is attached to the de- 
scription of Tatu-peba (Dasypus gilvipes, 111.). This blunder 
has caused Cuvier to refer Marcgraaf 's Tatu-peba to the one 
we are considering ; an error which has even been introduced 
into the system by subsequent French zoologists, by the 
elevation of the Indian name into the systematic specific 
appellation of the species ; so that by Desmarest it is styled 
Dasypus peha ; by F. Cuvier, Tatusia peha ! Moreover, it 
is identical with the Dasypios octocinctus of Linnaeus ; with 
BufFon's Cachicame, Tatu-ete, and Tatou a longue queue ; as 
also with Azara's Tatu negro. Much less common are the 
two next s^QC\e^,'[I)asypus gilvipes, 111. and Dasypus gymnu- 
rtis, 111. The first, as I have said, is called Tatu-peba by the 
Brazilians, and is very well described by Marcgraaf, pa. 231. 
It is the Dasypus sexcinctus and Das. octodecemcinctus of 
Linnaeus ; Buffon's Encouhert and CArquinson ; and Azara's 
Tatu-poyu. Illiger's name is a translation of the Indian one, 
which signifies ''the Tatu with the yellow foot;" and should 
be preferred to the later titles proposed by Desmarest, of Da- 
sypus Encouhei't, or Das. setosus of the Prince of Neuwied. 
The other. Das. gymnurus, 111., is called by the Brazilians 
" Tatu de rabo molle ; " that is, the Tatu with the soft tail. 
It is the Dasypus imicinctus of Linnaeus ; BufFon's Cahassou 
propre ; and Azara's Tatu-ay. This Indian title has been 
less happily advanced to the systematic specific name, in the 
Das. Tatu-ay of Desmarest ; and Tatusia Tatu-ay of F. Cu- 
vier.^ The largest existing species of this family, Dasypus 
Gigas, Cuv. (called by the Brazilians " Tatu canastra "), is 
much rarer than the three preceding, and has indeed been 
seen by iew persons. I only know it from the description of 
the Brazilians ; which is also the case with a fifth species, 
called " Tatu-bola " by the Brazilians, {Dasypus trie inctus, 
Linn. ; Tatu-apara, Marc. ; Taiu-matocco, Azara) ; which 
does not occur in this district, but serves to complete the list 
of tlie species of this family existing in the whole of Brazil.^ 

* Cuvier, in his ' Ossem. Foss.' and ' Regne Anim.' ascribes to his cabas- 
sou, a tail provided with scattered scales; and applies to itHhe synonyms of 
Linnaeus, BufFon, and Azara. At the same time he describes, as a distinct 
species, one with a naked tail, only armed with scales underneath, near the 
end. How far such a specific distinction has any real foundation in na 
ture, I dare not determine : I can only affirm that the species which occurs 
here, has a tail entirely naked above, and more or less scaled underneath 
for the whole of the hinder half: and as Azara gives a similar description 
of the Paraguay species, his Tatu-ay, as well as the Tatu de rabo molle, 
may be classed among the last, instead of the first two of these species. 

2 Cuvier indeed speaks of a sixth species brouglit home by A. de St. Hi- 



108 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

The second family, the Ant-bears, contains two species 
occurring in this district ; namely, Myrmecophaga juhata, 
Linn., and Myr. tamandua^ Cuv., the latter of which is very 
common, while the first is but seldom met with. 

The third family. Sloths, is not found here. It contains 
three known species, which are confined to the continuous 
belt of forest that covers the coast-line of Brazil, and the 
banks of its larger rivers j in the interior highlands they are 
never seen. 

Thus we see that seven species of the order Edentata at 
present inhabit this district ; one of which, namely, Dasypus 
longicaudus, is extraordinarily abundant : three, namely, Das. 
gymnurus, Das. gilvipes, and Myrmecophaga Tamandua, are 
tolerably common : one, namely, Myrmecophaga juhata, is 
very rare : and finally, the seventh species, namely, Dasypus 
Gigas, is so scarce that it has been seen but by very few. A 
much more extensive variety of species in this remarkable 
order of animals inhabited Brazil, in that remote period of 
which I shall now proceed to treat ; and they have left re- 
mains which, as records of the extraordinary conformation, 
comparatively clumsy make, and gigantic size of the animals 
when living, must excite our wonder and admiration. 



PART II. 

Having in my previous communication detailed at length the 
circumstances under which the fossil bones occur in the Bra- 
zilian caves, 1 shall now pass at once to a particular descrip- 
tion of the species of Mammalia which they include. 

First Order, 5/2 C/r^. 

[In my former paper I adopted Cuvier's name for this order, 
Edentata, or teethless animals : but with all my reverence 
for the great man from whom this nomenclature proceeds, and 
in spite of its almost universal adoption, I cannot any longer 
conceal the se ious objections which the use of so improper 
an appellation has ever excited in me ; since out of the great 
number of species contained in this order, two only are with- 
out teeth. Neither can we admit Oken's change of the name 



laire, under the name of Tatu verdade, but we have already seen that this 
is the name of Dasypus longicaudus ; and as this animal varies exceedingly, 
it may be easily considered as only a variety of this species. Azara's Ta- 
tu-mulita, Tatu-velu, and Tatu-piehy, do not belong to the class of tropical 
jinimals, as they are only found to the south of the tropics, never in Brazil. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 109 

to thsit o( ZaliJiarm, or " ill-provided with teeth ; " because 
we not only find in this very Order, the greatest number of 
teeth yet known in mammals {Dasypus Gigas having ninety- 
six), but also every variety of teeth ; namely, molars in all, 
except Myrmecophaga and Manis ; canines in Choloepus and 
Bradypus; incisors in Euphractus and Chlamydotherium. 
If we are determined to give this order a name, taken from 
the dental system, it cannot possibly be derived from any other 
peculiarity than the simple structure of the teeth ; and we 
might in that case call this order, Simplicidentata. But I 
much prefer Linnaeus' name, Bruta, which he has character- 
ized by the absence of incisors ; notwithstanding that he was 
compelled to admit some forms not strictly belonging to the 
order, from the indetenninateness of this character. In addi- 
tion to the authority and antiquity of this appellation, it has 
the further recommendation of signifying the imperfect or- 
ganization of the animals. I translate it by the term Sloths, 
or slow animals ; and I think it scarcely possible to find in 
their structure or habits any point more characteristic of the 
whole order, than that signified by this title. For the first 
family of this order which we have to consider, I have hitherto 
followed Illiger's name, Vermilinguia ; which, with him, 
likewise includes the genus Orycteropus. But further consi- 
derations, connected with my discoveries in the fossil Fauna, 
having convinced me of the correctness of Cuvier's views, in 
placing this animal among the armadilloes, Illiger's term be- 
comes inapplicable, particularly as another genus (Echidna), 
also possessing the same description of tongue, must be ex- 
cluded from this family. However, forasmuch as the genera 
belonging to this family are the only mammals entirely with- 
out teeth, or any substitute for them, I think it impossible to 
employ for them any name more applicable than that of 
Edentata, or teethless animals. For further details on this 
subject, I beg to refer to a paper in the ' Monthly Journal of 
Literature' for 1832, &c.J 

First Family, Edentata, Teethless. 

This family consists at present of two principal genera, 
Manis and Myrmecophaga : the former of which is confined 
to the Old, the latter to the New, World. Among the fossil 
remains here, I have discovered traces of the last-named ge- 
nus, which are however too imperfect to enable us to determine 
more accurately its relation to existing species. The frag- 
ments indicate an animal of the size of an ox ; wherefore I pro- 
pose for it the temporary name, Myrmecophaga gigantea. 



1 10 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

It is well known that the remains of a gigantic species of 
Mauls have been discovered in the temperate regions of the 
Old World : and we thus see that this family of animals ex- 
isted in former ages under the same geographical divisions as 
now, but under gigantic forms. 

Second Family, Effodientia. 

Insignificant as are the traces of the last family hitherto 
discovered by me, proportion ably numerous are the remains 
that I possess of the next, the armadilloes. This family is 
also now similarly abundant in species, arranged in several 
groups, which are so distinguished from each other, not mere- 
ly in their dental system, but also in their entire internal 
structure, that I cannot but agree with the views of those 
later zoologists, who have raised these long-acknowledged 
groups to the rank of genera ; which have at least a far better 
foundation than a large proportion of the genera established 
among the Ferae, Rodentia, and Qiiadrumana, but especially 
in the Ruminaritia. This generic division is still more in- 
dispensible for many of the extinct species of this family, 
which, in very essential points differ from those now existing; 
while others, which I shall first examine, show remarkable 
coincidences with them. 

The only species of the genus Dasypus (Wagl.) that occurs 
here, is the one described by Cuvier (Recherches, vol. i. pa. 
118) as brought over from Brazil by M. A. de St. Hilaire, 
under the name of Tatu-verdadeiro, and which he declares to 
be a new species,^ but for which I propose the name Das. 

^Should this opinion of Cuvier prove correct, as I confess later examina- 
tions lead me to believe it will, then the name of Dasypus longicaudus, 
which the Prince of Neuwied, without any further description, has given 
to the species of this genus observed by him, certainly must not be applied 
to this, which is precisely distinguished from Dasypus novemcinctus by its 
shorter tail. On the contrary, I should consider it to be the Das. octocinc-. 
tus of Linnaeus, for after examining a great number of individuals, of all 
ages, the normal number of bands iii this species seems constantly to be 
eight. I also consider it from the description, and especially from the num- 
ber of teeth given, to be identical with the species mentioned by Azara 
and Rengger, as belonging to Paraguay, (Tatu-hu or Tatu -noire). If these 
suppositions be confirmed, of which I entertain little doubt, then the three 
known species of this genus will form a very remarkable transition, in re- 
spect both of their geographical distribution, and of their size, number of 
bands, length of tail, &c. For the largest species {Das. novemcinctus, Lin. 
Das. lonqicaudus, Pr. Max.), with seven molars, nine bands, a tail of the 
same length as the body, inhabits Cayenne and the northernmost parts of 
Brazil ; the middle-sized species {Das. octocinctus, Lin. Das. uroceras, jM.), 
with eight molars, eight bands, and a tail somewhat shorter than the body, 



PREVIOUS TO THE^AST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. Ill 

uroceras, on account of the horny kind of sheath which en- 
closes the end of its tail. Among the fossil remains of this 
family, I find traces of a species of an existing genus which, 
in size, coiTcsponds exactly with the living species ; but as 
all the species of this genus resemble each other very closely 
in their internal conformation, 1 dare not yet quite decide up- 
on the relation between the fossil and the existing species. 

Of the genera, Toli/peutes (Illiger) and Priodon (F. Cuv.) I 
have hitherto discovered no traces among my fossils. At the 
same time I find several bones of species of Tatu, of which 
some resemble the corresponding bones of the genus Eu- 
phr actus of Wagler, {Dasypus, Fr. Cuv., Les Encouherts, G. 
Cuvier) ; while others agree more with those of the genus 
Xenurus, Wagler, [Les Cahassous propres Cuv.) ; and others 
again most resemble those of the proper Dasypus genus. — 
Without doubt these bones belong to several different species, 
all of considerable size ; but as 1 am not yet able to speak of 
them with certainty, I will leave them for the present, in or- 
der to pass on to others, of which I possess either more cha- 
racteristic or more perfect remains. 

Of the first of the two genera I am about to describe, I pos- 
sess indeed only portions of the dental system ; but they are 
so characteristic as to be abundantly sufficient, in and by 
themselves, to indicate the extinct generic forms. The first 
genus I for the present call Euryodon. And before proceed- 
ing to describe it I would remark, once for all, that the 
generic names which I have found myself obliged to apply to 
animals of whose organization I possess but few" remains, are 
only to be considered as provisional. For although the little 
that I do possess of them is amply sufficient to determine 
their independence as a genus, it is yet very possible that the 
most essential or the most distinctive characters may exist 
precisely in those parts of the skeleton w^hich I have not yet 
found. However, it was absolutely necessary to give these 
new generic forms at least provisional names, for the sake of 
brevity and clearness in the following general descriptions. 
The teeth of Euryodon are distinguished from those of all 
existing armadilloes in this respect, that they are compressed 
from the front, backwards, w^hile the others are more or less 
laterally compressed ; for the rest, the grinding surface, as in 



frequents central Brazil and Paraguay; while the least of all (Da^. septem- 
cinctus, Linn., Das. hybridus, Desm.), with seven molars, seven belts, and 
a tail much shorter than the body, occurs only in the extra- tropical part of 
South America. 



112 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY.. 

the existing species, consists of two faces, which meet at an • 
acute angle in a transverse ridge. 

If the bones which I have found associated with these teeth 
belong to the same animal, they seem to attest a size approach- 
ing that oi Priodon giganteus. 

The second of these genera I call Heterodon, because its 
teeth exhibit a much greater want of conformity amongst 
each other, both as to their shape and size, than is the case 
in the existing armadilloes. Both the anterior and posterior 
molars are small and conical ; while the penultimate and 
antepenultimate are much larger, the section of the former 
being oval and of the latter heart-shaped. The single species 
of this genus possessed by me, is of the same size as the 
commonest recent armadillo, Dasypus uroceras.

Art. II. — Notes on Irish JVatural History, more especially Ferns. 
By Edward Newman, Esq., F.L.S., &c. 

( Continued from page 7b). 

In the ascent from the lakes of Killamey towards the po- 
lice-station on the Kenmare road, I turned a little out of my 
way to see the fall of Derrycunhuey. It is very different in 
character from O'Sullivan's or Turk, being of greater breadth 
and volume but of less height, and having in its channel vast 
masses of lichen-stained rock. I nev^-^aw such a profusion 
of HymeiiophyUum as grows on the stones around this water- 
fall : the two species were completely intermixed. I spent 
an hour searching every dark hole for Trichomanes^ but with- 
out success. From the police-station the view over the lakes 
is very celebrated ; but I think they lose a great part of their 
beauty when seen from so great a height and distance. They 
become diminutive, and you see their sinuous outline and 
numerous islands as laid down in the maps, but the sweet 
variety of colour, and fantastic figure of rocks, which, when 
viewed more nearly, form so prominent a part of their attrac- 
tions, are here entirely lost. I lingered to take a last farewell 
of those lovely lakes, and to smile on the legendary lore so 
highly prized by the dwellers amid this wild scenery : no 
mountain -summit, no shady cove, no rocky islet, but has its 
fairy tale. The lakes themselves are clearly traced to fairy 
origin, as the legend of Norah and Coolin abundantly sets

forth. The wild country around the lakes admits of little 
farming ; but the land north of Killarney is good, and lets 
well, — 10s. and 12s. per Irish acre. It principally belongs 
to Lords Headley and Kenmare, both highly respected by their 
tenantry. One of those touching testimonials, so character- 
istic of Ireland, was about to be offered to Lord Headley 
shortly after I left: — his tenants intended inviting him to a 
public dinner. The Irish landlords appear to be revered 
throughout Ireland, in a manner of which, in England, we can 
form no notion ; a few, a very few, exceptions to this may be 
met with, in which political landlords have uniformly turned 
out the native residents to make room for tenantry more sub- 
servient to their views. 

The road to Kenmare is over a bleak and wild mountainous 
country, but httle cultivated. The outline of Macgillicuddy's 
Reeks, stretching far away to the right, I thought particularly 
fine. I found every possible form of Polystichum aculeatum 
growing among the rocks ; also Lastrcea Filix-mas, Las. di- 
latata, and AthAfrium Filix-fcemina. Descending from the 
high ground towards Kenmare, I was struck with the great 
abundance and beauty of Bartsia vlscosa and Pinguicula 
grandijlora ; and, on the high ground, with the size and lux- 
uriance of a species of Euphorbia, perhaps Eti. Characias. 
The land towards Kenmare belongs, I believe, almost exclu- 
sively to the Marquis of Lansdowne. The rent is various : 
some little farms, to which farm-houses are attached, fetch as 
much as 5s. or 6s. per Irish acre, and I heard of one farm as 
high as 9s., but it must be recollected that this price includes 
the house, which, on the Lansdowne property, is almost inva- 
riably good. 

It is a fine wild walk over the hill from Kenmare to Glen- 
garriff : the road has lately been cut at great expense and 
labour ; it passes through tunnels of solid rock, the last of 
which, on the very crest of the hill, is of great length and very 
dark, notwithstanding a light-hole in the centre from above. 
On emerging from the last tunnel, the view southward begins 
to open ; it is very extensive, and the outlines are rugged and 
extremely picturesque. The view varies with every step. — 
Ban try Bay, its coves, islands, and sinuous shores, and 
the wild hills rising above them, are spread map-like before 
you. It was from this descent that I saw that most noble 
of our native quadrupeds, the stag, browsing at a distance on 
the mountain- side. As I approached Glengarriff there seemed

other in hardihood : they may be continually seen rooted in 
the scarcely perceptible clefts of a perpendicular rock, and 
throwing their fantastic branches over a river brawling at its 
base. The rock itself is so beautiful, and the streams are 
fringed with such magnificent Osmunda, that even Killarney 
would gain but little by a rigid comparison with Glengarriff. 
The rabbits and hares which swarm in this neighbourhood 
afford ample entertainment for foxes ; and I am led to believe 
that these animals are more numerous here than in any other 
part of the kingdom. Hunting, in a country where the foxes 
could go to earth at least once in every hundred yards, is out 
of the question ; and it is consequently held fair to trap and 
slaughter them by wholesale. Otters abound, and are very 
destructive to the fish. The golden eagle breeds in Hungry 
Hill, the Eagle's Nest, and several other hills on the west 
side of Ban try Bay : hawks are most abundant; ravens, crows, 
rooks, jackdaws, and magpies, occur in profusion. Hood- 
ed crows and choughs are known here, but are not, as in some 
localities I have mentioned, the most numerous birds of the 
crow tribe. I did not stay sufficiently long at Glengarriff to 
make anything like a list of the ferns ; nor did I notice any 
species that I have not already mentioned as common through- 
out my journey. 

At Lord Bantry's lodge I was extremely amused with the 
manifold trophies of delimct stags which are exhibited within 
and without the dwelling, and also with the singularly wild 
and picturesque character of his demesne. After wandering 
about for some time I retimied to the shore, and throwing my 
knapsack into a boat, I took the helm, and in a few minutes 
four noble-looking fellows were rowing me down Ban try Bay. 
I steered first along the western coast, to see the eastern to 
greater advantage, but the hills are rounded and insignificant; 
I then crossed to Whiddy Island, a fertile and extremely well 
cultivated tract, three miles in length, and containing five 
hundred inhabitants : from this a fine view is obtained of the 
Caha Hills on the west coast. The sea was, for an Irish sea, 
extremely calm ; the air perfectly still, and the sky cloudless : 
there was a rich saffron tint in the air, which seemed to in- 
vest every object with a kind of golden mantle : it appeared 
more like what I fancy an Asiatic than an Irish atmosphere. 
There w as that quiet and balmy feel in the air which we call 
an indication of settled weather : I could scarcely believe that 
I was in a land where

After landing at Bantry I strolled over Lord Bearhaven's 
park and garden, and here I first found Polypodium vulgare 
in its very divided form, as discovered by Mr. Mackay in 
County Wicklow : it grows abundantly on the park-wall, just 
out of the town. The growth of some exotics in the garden 
is of extraordinary luxuriance : on the lawn before the house 
are some ten or twelve hydrangeas, the smallest of which is 
twenty long steps in circumference, and the one which I sup- 
posed the largest, thirty-three steps, or at least a hundred 
feet. Several species of Erica, and amongst them Erica 
Mediterranea, also several Fuschias, were of equally luxuri- 
ant proportions, and the laurel contended in vigour with the 
native arbutus. 

I walked up the hill at the back of the house, through a 
herd of fallow deer, which seemed infected by the luxurious 
and enervating calm of the evening, and would hardly rise at 
my approach. The summit of this eminence was covered 
with rooks and jackdaws; I think there must have been mil- 
lions, they really blackened the sky when they rose, which 
they did with reluctance and soon settled again, some on the 
ground, and some on little clumps of young firs, which bent 
down with the unusual weight. This eminence commands a 
glorious view over the Bay, its islands, GlengarrifF, the Caha 
Hills, &c., and the extraordinary fall of Adrigoil in Hungry 
Hill was just visible, like a thread of silvery light. This cas- 
cade appears little known ; few, if any of our tourists have 
visited it, and I had never by any chance heard even its name 
until now, in its immediate neighbourhood : it is said to be 
850 feet in height, which I think will exceed any other in the 
kingdom. I lingered till the last ray of the setting sun had 
vanished from the Caha Hills and the distant Reeks, — till 
the golden flame-tint had left the north-west, and was suc- 
ceeded by a green indescribably beautiful ; while the zenith, 
and indeed nearly all the other parts of the sky, were of that 
exquisite colour which T suppose the Latin poets mean by 
the word purpureus, as in 

"• Largior liic campos ffither et lumine vestit 
Purpureo ; " 

and many other passages. This colour rapidly faded, and as 
night was fast approaching I made the best of my way to 
Bantry. 

There are few who happened to be in Ireland on the 30th 
of July, 1839, that will forget it. The flood-gates of heaven 
seemed opened, and earth appeared about to be visited by a 
second deluge : men, women, children, cows, sheep, goats, 



116 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

pigs, were swept from the face of the earth : nearly a hun- 
dred bridges were totally demolished, and watercourses, — 
foaming rivers, — flowed where none were known before. It 
began raining about midnight, little more than two hours af- 
ter the glorious sunset I have described, and the water seemed 
to descend in streams rather than drops during the whole of 
the ensuing day. 

From Bantry 1 went to Skibbereen : the stony and hilly 
country possessed but little that was interesting, and though 
farming was attempted, it was the most wretched attempt 
I had yet seen. Osmunda, Athyrium Filix-foemi7ia, and 
Lastrcea dilatata, were abundant, but generally of stunted 
growth. Between Skibbereen and Rosscarberry are some 
small but picturesque lakes, celebrated for their trout-fishing; 
the gillaroo trout being taken in great abundance. Mr. Pen- 
nant treats of this as a variety of the common trout ; but al- 
most every fisherman in Ireland thinks differently, and the 
Rev. Mr. Maxwell also appears to treat it as distinct. ' I 
cannot say much in favour of Mr. Maxwell's zoological at- 
tainments; his mistaking the eagle for the osprey, and gravely 
quoting Bewick's description of the osprey as an illustration 
of the eagle of Achill, is a remarkable instance of his ignor- 
ance in the ornithological branch of the subject; but with 
fish he is evidently more at home. The gillaroo trout differs 
principally from the common trout in the extreme hardness 
and gizzard-like structure of its stomach, a character that 
especially adapts it to the comminution of the testaceous 
Mollusca on which it feeds. It is usually twice the size of 
the common trout. It has been said that the gillaroo has only 
been found west of the Shannon, but this I am scarcely in- 
clined to believe : I have indisputable authority for recording 
it as a native of the loughs near Skibbereen, which, though 
not to the east of the course of the Shannon, can nevertheless 
scarcely be said to be west of that river. The fish from Lough 
Neagh figured by Mr. YarrelP has little resemblance in form 
to the gillaroo of the west, a fish which is more correctly re- 
presented by the rough cut in the ' Dublin Penny Journal.' ^ 

Sir Humphrey Davy says that " the gillaroo trout differs in 
appearance very little from the common trout, except that 
they have more red spots, and a yellow or golden-coloured 
belly and fins, and are generally a broader and thicker fish ; 
but internally they have a diff'erent organization, possessing 
a large, thick, muscular stomach, which has been improperly

compared to a fowl's, and which generally contains a quanti- 
ty of small shell-fish of three or four kinds ; and though in 
those I caught the stomachs were full of these shell-fish, yet 
they rose greedily to the fly. The common trouts of these 
lakes have stomachs like other trouts, which never, as far as 
my experience has gone, contain shell-fish ; but of the gil- 
laroo trout I have caught some, not larger than my finger, 
which have had as perfect a hard stomach as the larger ones, 
with the coats as thick in proportion, and the same shells 
within ; so that this animal is at least now a distinct species, 
and is a sort of link between the trout and char, which has a 
stomach of the same kind with the gillaroo, but not quite so 
thick, and which feeds at the bottom in the same way. 1 
have often looked in the lakes abroad for gillaroo trout, but 
never found one."^ 

From Rosscarberry to Cloghnakilty the country is pretty 
generally cultivated, and a good deal of wheat was in ear. — 
Near *the town of Cloghnakilty I obtained a fine view down 
the bay of the same name. From thence I proceeded to Ban- 
don. Near Innisshannon the country is picturesque, and 
the banks of the river Bandon are finely wooded. On ap- 
proaching Cork I found the immediate neighbourhood well 
cultivated, and intersected with hedge-rows as in England. 
There are a great number of trees in the hedge-rows, and 
these were shrouded up the sides, a horrible practice, long 
sanctioned by fashion throughout England, but seldom ob- 
servable in the sister island, where trees are too scarce and 
valuable to be treated in this ignominious and injurious 
manner. 

I believe a tomist might write a good chapter on the town 
of Cork, its magnificent jail, its innumerable cars, its splen- 
did horses, and its rapid river ; but I will not treat on these 
topics farther than to say that it is a good-looking town, and 
contains 100,000 inhabitants. The river or creek below Cork 
is very pretty, the hilly banks being loaded with luxuriant 
shrubberies and tasty-looking houses. The town of Cove is 
prettily situated on an island called Great Island, and is about 
ten miles nearer the sea. Its houses are covered with a Mac- 
kintosh of slate to shoot off the rain, which is here nearly in- 
cessant. The view of Cork Harbour from the upper part of 
Cove town is very fine. 

At low w^ater, a considerable space of mud being left un- 
covered, I had an opportunity of observing the extreme bold- 
ness of the curlews, crows, and sea-gulls, which come in 

' Salmonia. 



118 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

great numbers close to the town of Cork, apparently attracted 
by some favourite food left by the falling tide. The ferns 
I observed in the immediate neighbourhood of Cork, were 
Lomarla spicant, rare ; Pteris aquilina, rare ; Polypodium 
vulcfare^ very common, and numerous palmated varieties ; 
Polystichum aculeatum, Lastrcea Filix-mas and Las. dilata- 
ta, Athyrium Filix-foemina, Asplenium Adiantum-niyrum, 
AspL Ruta-muraria, Aspl. Trichomaiies, Scol opendrium vul- 
gave, Ceterach officinarum, and Osmunda regalis ; and it 
should be remarked that these were observable merely in 
passing along the main thoroughfares, all of them except the 
two first, growing on the walls of the gardens and shrubberies. 

From Cork I proceeded northwards, through Watergrass 
Hill and Rathcormuck, to Fermoy. The river Blackwater 
having, during the late inundation, swept away entire fields 
of hay, a vast quantity had been arrested in its progress by 
the bridge at Fermoy, and was now collected in large cocks 
in the town, presenting a curious spectacle. Ceterach offici- 
narum, Asplenium Adiantum-niyrum^ Aspl. Ruta-muraria, 
and Aspl. Trlchomanes, and Scolopendrium milyare., half-co- 
vered the walls between Cork and Fermoy. The country 
was apparently well farmed, but otherwise very uninteresting. 
From Fermoy to Mitch elstown the country is not so well 
farmed, still there is little, if any, out of cultivation. I tra- 
velled this distance, and also from Mitchelstown to Sheely's 
Inn, half way between that place and Cahir, by Bianconi, but 
I found it a loss rather than a gain of time, for several bridges 
had been totally destroyed, and temporary crossings of the 
most ticklish description served as their substitutes, often 
causing very tedious delays. The ferns which I observed by 
the way, in addition to the five lately mentioned, were Xo- 
'inaria spicant, Pteris aquilina, both rare, and requiring a 
sharp look-out ; Athyrium Filix-foemina, hastrcua dilatata^ 
and Osmunda regalis^ in the usual abundance. Sheely's Inn 
is in the county of Tipperary, and midway between Mitchels- 
town and Cahir. 

Long before I set foot in Ireland I had determined to visit 
the caves at this spot. They are usually known as the King- 
ston Caves, because situated on the property of Lord Kingston. 
Crossing the road from Sheely's Inn, you proceed up a nar- 
row lane for about a mile, two low roundish hills rising before 
you, which are partially covered with a growth of shrubby 
wood. In each of these hills is a cave : that to the right is 
the cave of Sheheewrinky, and is also called the Old Cave, 
having been known for a great number of j^ears ; and that to 
the left the Cave of Coolnagarranroej being situated in the 



NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 119 

town-land of that name, and is called the New Cave, having 
been unknown till the year 1833, when it was explored by a 
son of mine host, in company with a man named Condon, 
who first discovered its entrance while at work in the quarry. 
It is now only to be seen by applying to Gorman, the man 
who rents the ground, and who, having had the entrance se- 
cured by a door which is kept carefully locked, excludes 
all but those who pay handsomely for the entertainment. 
Throughout Ireland you either get served for nothing, or pay 
ten times as much as in England : there is no moderation. 
The Cave of Coolnagarranroe is now exclusively visited. The 
little hills containing these caves are described by a geolo- 
gist^ as lying " in the valley which separates the Galtee and 
Knockmildown chains of mountains, the former constituting 
its northern, the latter its southern boundary. The prevail- 
ing rock at this extremity of the Galtees is conglomerate, 
which occasionally passes into sandstone ; while that which 
composes the opposite chain of hills possesses a structure 
intermediate between that of sandstone and schist, and in- 
cludes few if any rounded or water-worn pebbles. The ma- 
terial of the interposed valley is compact grey limestone, and 
this rock forms two small rounded hills, &c." Although no- 
thing of a geologist, I presume I may venture to assert that 
the interior of the cave presents nothing to the eye but the 
grey limestone before alluded to by Dr. Apjohn, carbonate of 
lime in the infinitely varied conformations of spar, a soft red 
clay which appeared partially to cover the floor of the cave, 
and to fill many of its crevices, and a fine light-coloured sand 
which is present in one chamber only. 

Immediately on the door being opened I followed Gorman 
down a steep passage of some two or three dozen yards in 
length ; after me came Gorman's son, and a " boy " who vo- 
lunteered the office of assistant- assistant- guide, brought up 
the rear. Each of the four held a candle, and each proceeded 
in the position most agreeable to himself; the height of the 
passage being somewhat less than four feet, and our own 
heights varying between five feet and a half and six feet and 
a half. This passage was pleasantly varied about the middle 
by a perpendicular fall of five or six yards, and here a ladder 
was fixed. At its termination the footing becomes tolerably 
horizontal, and the aperture wider and higher, and this con- 
tinues for about a hundred yards, when I was ushered 
into the "House of Commons," a splendid chamber, which

120 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

I should suppose fifty yards in length, twenty to twenty-five 
in breadth, and twelve or fourteen in height. Young Sheely 
and Gorham gave me the precise measurement, but not only 
did they not agree, but their statements considerably exceed- 
ed my estimate of the dimensions ; therefore I prefer my own, 
which is deduced from steps, when a question of length and 
breadth, and from guess, when one of height. The roof is 
adorned with an infinity of icicle-like stalactites, and the fis- 
sures in the limestone are encrusted wdth glittering spar : the 
floor is almost without a trace of stalagmitic deposition, but 
in several places I observed the huge blocks of limestone of 
which it is composed deeply pitted with the dropping of wa- 
ter from the roof. 

I was now led through a passage of perhaps ten or fifteen 
yards in length, and of considerable breadth and height, into 
the " House of Lords." My childhood's dreams of the Grotto 
of Antiparos were here completely realized. I felt that to see 
this alone I would gladly have crossed the channel. I know 
not how to describe it. Suppose a room a hundred yards 
long, thirty yards wide, and ten yards high, — these are not 
ascertained dimensions, — suppose the roof beautifully arched 
as in Gothic halls, and that arched roof hung all over with 
icicles, and suppose some dozen or so of these icicles of vast 
size, hanging down till they reach incrusted masses of ice 
rising from the floor, and so become graceful pillars support- 
ing that vaulted roof; and then you may form some idea of 
the extreme beauty of this fairy chamber. One huge pillar is 
called the " Tower of Babel ; " and a mass of spar, where the 
water containing the carbonate appears to have fallen on a 
projecting rock, and so been compelled to trickle in various 
directions, thus forming a multitudinous mass of conglomer- 
ated stalactites, is called the " Turkish Tent." A third vast 
aggregate of spar is called " the Beehive," and a fourth " the 
Organ." The similarity of these beautiful masses of spar to 
the objects whose names they bear, is very obscure; in the 
instance of the organ, however, the pendant stalactites do 
really in some degree resemble the pipes of an organ, and 
Gorman and his associates followed each other in playing a 
voluntary on these pipes, by flourishing their " sprigs " along 
them, and thereby producing a sound by no means unplea- 
sant. Between these are many large accumulations of spar, 
all carefully named, but alas ! I have forgotten the nomencla- 
ture ; and almost every part of the floor is covered by stalag- 
mitic incrustations, which rise opposite to the stalactites pen- 
dant from the roof. In a few instances, how^ever, I observed 



NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 121 

that the continued dripping from the roof, instead of causing 
a stalagmitic deposition, had worn small circular holes in the 
limestone, as in the " House of Commons." 

Leaving this splendid chamber Gorman led me into what 
he called the " Long Cave : " the footing here was very bad ; 
little was obtained to pay for the trouble, for whichever way 
we turned we soon came to a part which Gorman told me was 
unexplored, and into which he did not choose to take me. 
I think there were seven or eight branches of this " Long 
Cave," which he said had never been visited, but the parts 
through which I wandered must have measured nearly an 
English mile. The floor sometimes consisted of the naked 
limestone, sometimes of clay, and sometimes spar, the latter 
being rugose and angular, and not possessing a smooth sur- 
face like that of the stalagmitic deposition to which I have 
before alluded. The roof occasionally exhibited festoons of 
spar, resembling wreaths of flowers, and struck me as very 
beautiful ; but still I was disappointed with this " Long Cave," 
because I fancied that I left so much unseen : and when Gor- 
man repeatedly told me that that was as far as we could go, 
although I saw a very obvious opening still farther, I could 
not help repeating the indignant and emphatic enquiry of the 
renowned Miss Squeers, — " Is this the Aend } " 

There is a second opening from the " House of Lords " 
leading, as Gorman assured me, to a river, but this river 
I could not find : there was, indeed, a puddle, and nothing 
more : I have since turned with some interest to see what 
Dr. Apjohn makes of the river, but I find he received it on 
trust, "such phenomenon was not at the time to be observed." 
T thence returned to the " House of Lords," entering that 
wondrous place for the third and last time, and thence to the 
" House of Commons" for the second time. Three passages 
emanate from this chamber, besides that by which I entered 
it, and the one leading to the " House of Lords." One of 
these possesses little interest, except that its extent is unas- 
certained : the two others are but difl'erent ways into another 
chamber, which is divided into two compartments by a rock 
running along the middle : this chamber has some enormous 
stalactitic pillars, and one little recess called the " Queen's 
Bedchamber," which is exquisitely beautiful, every part of it 
being covered with an incrustation of the most sparkling spar, 
in great variety of form. 

From the "Bedchamber Cave" (I believe this is the right 
name) I was led towards another passage, near the entrance 
of which stand some enormous masses of stalagmite, and one 

Vol. TV.— No. .39. n. s. o 



122 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

larger than the rest is called "Lot's Wife."' This passage 
leads into the " Kingston Gallery," a straight and narrow 
chamber or gallery sixty yards long. The roof and walls, 
throughout its entire length, are clothed with spar, which I 
remarked here assumes a variety of colours, sometimes bright 
red, sometimes barley-sugar-coloured. The beautiful roof 
possesses more architectural symmetry than that of any of the 
other chambers, and the pendant festoons of spar, resembling 
wreaths of flowers and flowing drapery, are most gorgeous. 
At two thirds of its length this gallery was originally com- 
pletely divided by a transparent curtain of spar, but through 
the centre of this an aperture has been made, and the entire 
chamber has been thus rendered visible at one view, partially 
interrupted however by six stalactitic pillars. The " King- 
ston Gallery " leads into a chamber which is nearly square, 
and without much ornamental spar; and beyond this is ano- 
ther passage or gallery, which runs for more than a hundred 
yards in a continuous line with the " Kingston Gallery," and 
of which the termination has not yet been found, so that it is 
compulsory to return to the square chamber, from which is a 
passage parallel with the " Kingston Gallery," and of some- 
what similar width and precisely similar length. The bot- 
tom of this passage is strewed with sand, and it is conse- 
quently called the " Sand Cave; " it contains little or nothing 
to attract admiration after the eyes have been feasting on the 
gorgeous beauties of the " Kingston Gallery." 

The two galleries open side by side, and within a few yards 
of "Lot's Wife" already noticed, and immediately adjacent 
to another chamber called the "Garret Cave," which appeared 
to me more extensive than either of the others. I fancy it is 
considerably more than a hundred yards in length, and it va- 
ries greatly in breadth. The floor is composed of stalagmitic 
masses and incrustations, and blocks of limestone rudely 
tossed together, the travelling over which is not very 
convenient ; it rises towards the farther extremity, thus 
reducing the height in that part. The walls are mostly 
sheeted with spar, and the stalactites, like glittering icicles, 
and often of very small size, hang by thousands from the roof; 
some however are of noble size, and having united with the 
stalagmite, form graceful pillars seemingly created purposely 
for the support of the roof. 

' This has been described as stalactitic, but I must allow my original 
note to stand, as it was made on the spot ; and though I will not lay claim 
to infallibility, especially in a science in which I am a confessed ignora- 
mus, yet my impression was and is, that it was the deposition from drop- 
ping, not from trickling ; that it had grown upwards, not downwards. 



NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 123 

It will I think be seen from this description, imperfect as I 
acknowledge it to be, that the cave of Coolnagarranroe is not, 
as generally supposed, a single opening of ascertained size 
and figure, but more resembles in its ramifications a vast 
mine, in which large excavations have occasionally been 
made, and of which no less than thirteen or fourteen obvious 
openings yet remain to be explored, offering a fine field, not 
merely for adventure but for theory, for w^ho shall say what 
wonders are yet undiscovered. I was perhaps rather lazy af- 
ter slipping about for seven or eight hours on the soft and 
slimy clay, and little inclined to prosecute further researches 
at the time, but I have often since regretted that I did not 
stimulate Gorman to further exertions while I was present, 
for he receives such a revenue from the fleecing of his present 
visitors, that he will never take the trouble by himself to make 
more discoveries. It is strange that those who manage the 
estate on behalf of the proprietor do not, in some way, restrain 
the impositions of this greedy man, for the cave being no part 
of his taking, he can only by courtesy be allowed the pecu- 
niary advantage of showing it. 

I have not in this rapid sketch noticed a tenth part of the 
curious forms of spar to which my attention w^as called ; 
among these the " Chum, " the " Ajigel's Head," the " Ava- 
lanche, " the " Lord Chancellor's Wig, " and " Aladdin's 
Lamp," struck me as remarkably beautiful ; the last is a pen- 
dant and somewhat cylindrical sheet of spar, so thin that the 
light of a candle is scarcely decreased by being placed inside 
it. Perhaps however the most magnificent mass of spar, ei- 
ther here, or known in the world, is that called the " Queen's 
Mantle." Its appearance is somewhat similar to that which 
might be produced by throwing a dozen shaw^ls carelessly 
over a pole suspended horizontally, their folds being allowed 
to arrange themselves at random, as they hung from the pole 
in a confused mass ; the height of this mass is twenty or 
twenty-five feet, and the substance so thin as to show very 
clearly the flame of a candle held behind it : its extremities 
do not quite reach the floor. Owing to the frequent disturb- 
ance from handling which this and all the most remarkable 
objects are constantly undergoing from visitors, most of whom 
purchase the right of chipping off and carrying away what 
they please, it is much to be feared that the cave will even- 
tually be robbed of a great portion of its present beauty. 

I did not leave the cave without examining the clay and 
sand deposited in cavities under the stalagmitic incrustations 
of the floor, in the hope of finding the bones of extinct ani- 
mals ; but it was to no purpose, and 1 learned from Gorman 



124 SKETCH OF THE FLORA OF IPSWICH. 

that similar searches had frequently been made, but always 
without success. This leads me to believe in the correctness 
of Dr. Buckland's theory, that the cave at Kirkdale was the 
actual residence of the hyaenas whose bones it contained, and 
that these animals were instrumental in bringing thither those 
other animals, of which the bones are mingled with their own. 

On my return to Sheely's Inn the rain was so heavy that I 
determined to stay there for the night, an example which I 
can scarcely recommend any of my compatriots to follow, ex- 
cept those who, like myself, are willing to seek information 
at the expense of comfort. The landlord favoured me with 
his company, as did his son who first explored the cave, and 
of course the cave was the principal topic of conversation. I 
found Sheeley a remarkably intelligent man ; he possessed a 
knowledge of the politics of the day which quite put me to 
the blush, for I had not read a newspaper, to the best of my 
belief, for full six weeks previously to my visit to him. On 
the subject of the cave I learned some interesting particulars, 
more especially in relation to the frequent visits paid them by 
Lord Kingsborough. He showed me a variety of spars, and 
explained them very scientifically, expressing his regret that 
the spar should be wantonly broken and carried away by vi- 
sitors. Some of my countrymen, in their zeal for science, 
had thrown large stones where the stalactites were most 
thickly clustered, and thus produced showers of spar, a phe- 
nomenon readily obtained, for the slender stalactites break 
almost as readily as icicles. 

Sheeley told me that the first time Gorman entered the cave 
with two or three companions, their candles accidentally went 
out and left them in utter darkness. They had advanced so 
far that their cries were inaudible above ground, and they sat 
down, expecting nothing better than death by starvation. 
Gorman having been missed from his home, his son luckily 
thought of the cave, and descending with a light restored his 
father to the upper world.

Chelmsford, and Colchester, at the confluence of the rivers 
Orwell and Gipping. The Orwell commences at the har- 
bour, between Landguard Fort on the Suffolk side, and Har- 
wich on the Essex side, as also does the Manningtree river 
the Stour. Leaving the Stour, the Orwell takes a gradually- 
winding course for about twelve miles, when it passes the 
gentle declivity upon which the town of Ipswich is situated. 
Nearly half a mile beyond this it receives the waters of the 
Gipping, at the lock which is considered the boundary be- 
tween the two : beyond which the Orwell is continued under 
the latter name, as far as the town of Stowmarket. The mar- 
gins of these rivers afford a variety of plants ; several mari- 
time species are met with in the salt marshes on the banks 
of the Orwell, whilst the rich borders of the Gipping present 
the botanist with a greater number of species. The geologi- 
cal character of the country is various : chalk and clay extend 
over a considerable portion of the district, and the strata of 
sand and comminuted shells (provincially called " crag ") co- 
ver most of the south-eastern part, whilst another portion 
consists of gravel and siliceous sand. There is also in the 
neighbourhood a considerable extent of heath on the eastern 
side. The elevation of the higher parts of the district is from 
about sixty to one hundred feet ; and the country is exceed- 
ingly rich and well cultivated, beautifully undulating, and 
contains much wood. The plants growing in the neighbour- 
hood are the following, which I shall group together accord- 
ing to the natural system of Lindley. There are about 471 
phaenogamic plants, 12 Filices, and 4 Equisetacem.

CAPTURE OF ARGYNNIS APHRODITE. 131 



Art. IV. — Notice of the Capture of Argynnis AiDhrodite in War- 
wickshire. By The Rev. W. T. Bree, M.A. 

I HAVE the pleasure of announcing to the entomological read 
ers of the ' Magazine of Natural History,' the capture of an 
insect in this county which I believe to be hitherto entirely 
unheard of as a British species, — the Argynnis Aphrodite. 
A single example of this fine insect was taken by James Wal- 
house, Esq., of Leamington, in Ufton Wood, a few miles from 
that town, in the summer of 1833, and was kindly presented 
to my son, in whose possession it now is, by Moreton J. Wal- 
house, Esq., the brother of the captor. 

In thus announcing this interesting addition to our native 
Fauna, I am prepared to expect that entomologists may be a 
little sceptical on the subject, if they do not altogether dis- 
believe the fact. We know but too well that dealers will, 
without scruple, play all sorts of tricks — frauds, I ought to 
say, — by attempting to pass off foreign articles for native 
ones, whenever it may suit their purpose. We know too, 
that even honest collectors are not absolutely exempt from 
occasional mistakes, and that, accordingly, a stray exotic does 
now and then creep into the British cabinet quite surrepti- 
tiously. Again we are told, and I believe told truly, that in- 
sects are not unfrequently imported, either in the e^g, larva, 
or perfect state, with timber or other suitable merchandise. 
And lastly, we hear of Lepidopterous insects in the winged 
state, being blown over from the continent to our shores, if 
they have not undertaken a voluntary voyage thither. Bear- 
ing these circumstances in mind, and wishing as far as pos- 
sible to anticipate objections, I deemed it right to obtain, and 
trust I shall be excused for stating, all the particulars I could 
learn relative to the subject of the present article. Let us sift 
the evidence, then, and see how the above objections bear 
upon the case before us. 

And first for fraud : the specimen of Argynnis Aphrodite 
now before me, let it be remembered, has never been in the 
hands of a dealer, nor in the possession of any other person 
except Mr. Walhouse and his brother, from whom, as already- 
said, my son received it. These gentlemen are men of the 
highest respectability, quite above all suspicion of intentional 
deception. I may add, too, that at the time the insect was 
taken, Mr. Walhouse was only just beginning to pay atten- 
tion to Entomology. The immediate object of his visit to 
Ufton Wood was for the purpose of taking Argynnis Paphia ; 
and so little acquainted was he at that time with our British 
Papiliones, that in the first instance he even doubted whether 



132 CAPTURE OF ARGYNNIS APHRODITE. 

this specimen of Arg. Aphrodite were anything more than the 
usnal sexual distinction of Arg. Paphia. I mention this cir- 
cumstance in order to show that Mr. Walhouse was not at 
first aware of the prize he had taken, and therefore can hardly 
be suspected of having been actuated by the false feeling, 
which might induce a dishonest person to pretend to have 
been the discoverer of a new British species. 

But acquitting these gentlemen (as we do entirely) of any- 
thing like wilful misinformation, may we not suppose that 
they have fallen into a mistake, and have inadvertently allow- 
ed a foreign specimen to gain admission among their British 
ones ? This is a fair question, and deserves consideration. — 
Mr. James Walhouse is now in India, and cannot conveni- 
ently be examined in the matter. On his leaving this country 
his collection of insects remained in the possession of his bro- 
ther, Mr. Moreton Walhouse. Now I have narrowly cross- 
examined this gentleman as to the possibility of a foreign 
specimen having found its way into their collection of native 
insects ; and he assures me, in reply, that they possessed no 
foreign insects whatever, till long after the time when Arg, 
Aphrodite wa« taken. And, what is more to the purpose, 
Mr. Moreton Walhouse informs me, that although he was not 
in company with his brother at the capture of Arg. Aphrodi- 
te, he yet himself saw the specimen as soon as it was brought 
home, while the wings were yet limber, and before the spe- 
cimen was set. Both gentlemen also were immediately aware 
of the great dissimilarity of the insect to any other with which 
they were acquainted, though they knew not what to make of 
it. Under these circumstances, therefore, I cannot withhold 
my own belief of the fact, that the individual specimen of 
Arg. Aphrodite now before me, was actually taken at Ufton 
Wood, as above stated. 

But next comes the question of importation ; in answer to 
which it is sufficient to state that Ufton Wood is situated in 
a thinly-populated part of the country, remote from any port 
or large mercantile town, a spot, therefore, extremely unlikely 
to have been the depository of an insect accidentally trans- 
mitted from abroad among articles of foreign produce. 

Lastly, as Arg. Aphrodite is a native of North America, 
(and not, I believe, of the European continent), the notion 
that the specimen had, either by accident or design, made its 
way across the Atlantic, and settled down, in a state of good 
preservation, as nearly as may be in the centre of our own 
island, is too improbable to be seriously entertained for a 
moment. 

I regret that Mr. Walhouse omitted to record the precise 



NOTES ON TELEPHORI. 133 

date of the capture of Arg. Aphrodite ; but as it occurred 
during the season when Arg. Paphia was on the wing, it 
must, most probably, have been in July or August. We may 
conclude also that the period of flight, with both insects, is 
the same. 

The accompanying figures (Sup. 111. PI. x.) supersede the 
necessity of entering into a minute description of the insect. 
It is larger^ than Arg gtmis Paphia, and of the same rich ful- 
vous colour, checkered and spotted with black, on the upper 
surface. The black spots and markings on the second pair 
of wings are niether so large nor so strongly developed as in the 
con^esponding wings of that species, and of Aglaia and Adip- 
pe ; to which latter species our insect more nearly approaches 
on the under surface, having the second pair of wings adorned 
with numerous silver spots on a buff-coloured ground, which 
is dark towards the base of the wings, and becomes lighter 
towards the lower extremities, with a marginal row of semi- 
circular silver spots. In the grouping of our British species 
T should feel disposed to place Argy finis Aphrodite between 
Arg. Paphia and Adippe, possessing, as it does, some cha- 
racters in common with each, while it is yet abundantly dis- 
tinct from either. 



Art. V. — Notes on Telephori, By Peter Rylands, Esq. 

The object of the present notice is to clear up the synonymy 
of Telephorus ater, and to correct some errors into which 
Mr. Stephens has fallen respecting that and allied species. 

As a text to the remarks which I have to submit on this 
subject, the following descriptions of Tel. ater imd.Jlavilahris 
from Mr. Stephens's ' Illustrations ' may be given.

colour: tarsi fuscescent: antennce with the three basal joints flavescent, 
the rest black. — Long. corp. 3-3|^."

the margins of the thorax, the disc of which is very glossy, the tibia, and 
apex of the abdomen, pale testaceous : palpi fuscous. Long. corp. 3-3^^. 

" This closely resembles the preceding species, but it is of 
a deeper black, &c." — ' Mandibulata,' iii. 295. 

It will be evident on examination that the two descriptions 
now quoted do not present sufficiently distinct characteristics 
to justify the adoption of both as species. Either Mr. Ste- 
phens's ater must be a variety of his Jlavilabr is, or vice versa. 
Both are acknowledged to be very "variable," and yet the 
only mark of distinction given as permanent, is thai Jlavila- 
bris differs from the other by being of a " deeper black " ! 
This surely cannot be considered sufficient for establishing a 
species ; and a fact which has been stated to me by my es- 
teemed friend, J. C. Dale, Esq., F.L.S., seems to prove that 
even this slight peculiarity cannot be relied upon, — his spe- 
cimens (named by Mr. Stephens himself), Mr. Dale informs 
me " are not so dark." 

The above remarks I think lead to the conclusion that Mr. 
Stephens's ater smdjlavilabris are one and the same species. 
I believe, however, that I shall be able to show that the true 
ater (of Linne) saidjlavilabris (of Fallen) are distinct. 

My attention was directed to this point by capturing a spe- 
cimen of Telephoi'iis at Egremont, near Liverpool, which did 
not agree with any of Mr. Stephens's descriptions, and which, 
for some time, appeared to me to be an entirely new species. 
Referring however to Paykull, I found that his description of 
Tel. ater of Linne did not agree with the description of ater 
given by Mr. Stephens, but that it did agree with my speci- 
men. It appears evident, therefore, that previous to the oc- 
currence just mentioned, the true ater has not been recorded 
as taken in Britain, although a spurious ater has been for 
some years entered in our Fauna. In this opinion I am sup- 
ported by the fact that in the last edition of his ' Guide ' Mr. 
Curtis places an % before Tel. ater, Lin., denoting that he 
has only foreign specimens of it. And I think that entomo- 
logists, when they compare Mr. Stephens's descriptions with 
the following one of my specimen, and with Paykull's of the 
Linngean ater, will be convinced of the correctness of the 
above remarks.

pallidaB rarius ferruginse. Tarsi jam nigri jam fusco-pallidi." — ' Fauna 
Suec' Insecta. tom. i. 266-7. 

The point in which Telephorus ater chiefly differs from 
Tel. Jlavilahris, and the specimens erroneously designated 
Tel. ater by Stephens, consists in the thorax being entirely 
black. I communicated the above descriptions to Mr. Dale, 
and requested him to inform me whether any of his speci- 
mens of Telephori agreed with them. His reply is in the 
negative, and furnishes additional evidence that the Linnaean 
ater has been mistaken by Mr. Stephens, who has rather 
carelessly (it must be confessed) placed under that designa- 
tion specimens having no distinctive characters, and evidently 
only varieties oi Jlavilabris. 

The genus Telephorus still requires much attention in or- 
der to elucidate its contents. Tel. fulvicollis, iridis, affinis 
(var. oi fulvicollis f), cantianus (var. of pellucidus ?), and 
others, require a strict investigation, in order that the species 
may be correctly characterised, and the mere varieties ar- 
ranged as such. In the forthcoming ' Synopsis' of Mr. Curtis 
it is to be hoped that much of this confusion will be obviated, 
and many errors in this and other groups corrected.

phens may be given as follows. —

136 OCCURRENCE OF TESTUDO CARETTA 



Art. VI. — Notice of the Occurrence of a living specimen of the 
Testudo Caretta on the Coast of Devonshire. In a Letter address- 
ed to W. Wilson Saunders, Esq., by Mr. W. Wilcox. 

East Hill, Wandsworth, 

19th Feb. 1840. 
Sir, 

I send you an extract from a letter I have just re- 
ceived from my friend, Mr. William Wilcox, of Biddeford, 
North Devon, which I think will interest some of your read- 
ers, as it announces the arrival on our coasts of a stranger, 
which had never visited us before. 

" I should have sent you the following particulars long be- 
fore this, but I have had no opportunity of examining the 
subject of your enquiries until now, — he having been on his 
travels since the date of my last to you. Indeed, the old say- 
ing of " it's an ill wind " &c. has been decidedly correct in 
the present case, for I believe the fortunate discoverers of this 
amphibious stranger have derived a very considerable advan- 
tage from showing him here, and in the adjacent towns, at 
the small charge of 2d. each person ; thus deriving a profit 
from the extraordinary gales of 1840. 

" I forget the precise date on what he was found, but know 
that it was two days prior to the date of my last, if you still 
have it to refer to.' It was lying on the beach at the mouth 
of the river Tor, about half a mile from the village of Inslow. 
When I saw it, it was in a very torpid state, and about ten 
days after it was discovered, it died. It has not been weigh- 
ed, but has been handled by myself, and by several others 
more conversant with such matters, and pronounced to be 
about 200 lbs. ; and it is fair to suppose, that before its arri- 
val into the cold waters of our climate, it must have weighed 
considerably more. Its extreme length after death, when the 
neck hung out from under the shell, was 4 feet 5 inches, and 
its breadth, 2 feet 9 inches ; but this measurement was, in 
both instances, made by running a line over the convexity of 
the shell, which of course adds something to the actual length 
and breadth. Having no better book to refer to than the 
abridgement of Cuvier which came out in numbers a few years 
ago, I speak with some diffidence when I call this animal the 
Testudo Caretta ; but as the other species appears to have 
fifteen scales, there can be little doubt about it, if the said

fore have been discovered on the 28th J anuary . 



ON THE COAST OF DEVONSHIRK.

book is right. There are also other peculiarities, which serve 
to confirm me in this opinion. There is a ridge, although a 
very inconsiderable one, running along the centre of the mid- 
dle scales ; and the toes, two on each fin, are strongly deve- 
loped, the larger one on the anterior fin being an inch and a 
quarter in length. Should you, on reference to better works 
on the subject than I can procure at this distance from Lon- 
don, think with me that this is the Caretta, it will next be- 
come a question w^hether he visited these shores through the 
agency of man or the elements ; and on this part of the sub- 
ject I must say that I am strongly inclined towards the latter 
opinion ; for certainly I never in the course of my experience, 
remember weather more favourable to such a result. For 
three weeks prior to the day he was found, there had been 
one uninterrupted gale from the West-South-West, excepting 
only once or twice for an hour or two, when the wind shifted 
a few points nearer to the North. Now supposing him to 
have been an inhabitant of the seas to the northward of the 
Azores, and on this subject I speak with deference to your 
greater knowledge, such a gale as I have described would 
have brought him here, lying, as I presume he did, on the top 
of the waves, at the rate of several miles an hour. And on the 
other hand, there is no great likelihood of his having been 
'w ashed from on board any ship, inasmuch as both his flesh 
and shell are nearly valueless, and therefore it is improbable 
that any one should have taken the trouble of bringing him to 
this country." 

Mr. Wilcox having favoured me with a sketch of the turtle 
forming the subject of the above extract, with dimensions of 
the various parts, taken apparently with great accuracy, I will 
add the following particulars from his data, which 1 think 
will serve to illustrate the subject more fully.

Art. VII. — Notice 7'elating to the recent Landslip on the Devonshire 
Coast. By John Young, Esq., in a letter to the Editor. 

My visit to the landslip at Culverhole Point, near Axmouth, 
was of so hasty a nature as scarcely to wan-ant my attempting 
any description of the phenomena which came under my no- 
tice. I have moreover, for the last twenty years, given my 
attention to Horticulture rather than to Geology, and fear 
therefore, that 1 shall fail in furnishing such an account as 
would interest those of your readers who are acquainted with 
the latter science, and that my unlearned description will be 
hardly worthy a place in your journal. 

My ignorance of the original position of the ground where 
the subsidence has taken place, is one disadvantage under 
which I labour. It appears, however, that numerous catas- 
trophes of a similar kind had taken place on this part of the 
coast at remote periods, forming what is called the Under- 
cliffy, and let it be remarked, that it is in connection with a 
part of this Vndercliff', about a mile to the east of Cul- 
verhole Point, that the sinking of the ground on the 24th 
December last commenced, taking a direction towards the 



ON THE COAST OF DEVONSHIRE. 139 

liorlli-west, continuing in this course about half a mile, then 
gradually bending to the south, till it meets the shore at or 
near Culverhole Point, its western extremity. The level of 
the ground, in which this ravine has been fonned varies con- 
siderably ; its deepest part showing cliffs of 200 feet perpen- 
dicular height, whilst at the extremities adjoining the Under- 
cliff, the level is not greatly changed, and the line of subsi- 
dence marked principally by numerous small fissures in the 
ground, by the fall of trees, &c. The present appearance 
of the ravine is highly picturesque, for notwithstanding the 
depth of the chasm, and the almost entire giving way of the 
sub-strata, there are numerous columnar, tower-shaped, and 
pyramidal masses of the chalky limestone, standing in the 
deepest part, apparently unmoved, and which, particularly 
when viewed longitudinally, form a striking group, whilst 
around and beneath them the furrows of the corn-fields can 
be traced nearly in the state the plough had left them. The 
character of this late subsidence differs materially from that 
of those which have preceded it, — the latter having taken 
place in that part of the land immediately adjacent to the 
sea beach,- the one now under consideration having left the 
outer portion of the cliff almost entirely unmoved ; and this 
circumstance viewed, in connection with the reef which has 
been upraised in the sea, makes the unaltered position of the 
cliff the more remarkable : it was this part of the scene which 
attracted much of my attention, particularly the reef, ( for I 
know of no better name for it), which was formed simulta- 
neously with the sinking of the land ; consequently, there 
must have been a connection between the causes which pro- 
duced these two phenomena, — the lower or west extremity of 
the reef, commencing at or near Culverhole Point, forming a 
segment of a circle, (a little irregular in its shape), runs into 
the shore, at the eastern extremity of the subsidence ; — the 
reef is composed of the original bed of the sea upheaved, 
without disturbing, to any considerable extent, the masses of 
stone with which it is covered ; and without injuring the beau- 
tiful sea-weeds which appear to have luxuriated in the 
habitat which they had chosen, for they had covered the 
stones like a carpet ; and so gently must this extraordinary 
upheaving have taken place, that scarcely a fibre of these 
beautiful marine plants exhibits traces of injury. The main 
bulk of the reef is composed of what appears to be indurated 
sand, or possibly a bed of marl connected with the lias for- 
mation ; the seaward face of it stands about 25 feet above 
high-water-mark, at its highest point at the east end, whence

llie whole gi-adually sinks as it runs westward ; and when it 
reaches the western extremity of the subsidence, it is scarcely 
distinguishable at high water : it is said that previously to 
24th December last, vessels sailed over the whole of this 
ground. 

I would gladly enter into the subject of the probable cau- 
ses which have been instrumental in producing the changes 
I have described, but as my acquaintance with the Geology 
of the neighbourhood is very limited, I must not venture 
upon any thing further than the above hasty sketch of this 
interesting spot : I must not, however, omit to refer to the 
fact, that the chalky limestone, which, I believe, forms the 
upper stratum of the rock of this part of the county, over- 
lies a bed of loose sand, the action upon which, of the su- 
perabundant rains of 1839, added to the same agency carried 
on through past centuries, conspired in producing the phe- 
nomena I have been endeavouring to describe. If the an- 
serine tribe had the power of speech, they could give valuable 
evidence, as it is said, that some of that family made a sub- 
terranean voyage from a neighbouring farm into the sea. — 
I must, €71 passant, tell you of another report ; it is said, that 
a few years back, some persons in digging a well, at or near 
Axminster, about 5 or 6 miles to the northward of the sea- 
coast, came to a bed of sand through which a rapidly flowing 
stream was passing towards the ocean, and that they had the 
curiosity to throw into it a few bushels of charcoal, which 
made its appearance in the sea, about three miles eastw ard 
of the mouth of the Axe. 

I hope Professor Buckland, (who, I understand has visited 
the spot), or some other eminent Geologist, will give us his 
opinion on the causes which have led to these phenomena ; 
and which, it appears to me, will tend to throw much light 
on the formation of many narrow and deep valleys, in cer- 
tain districts of this country.

ON AFFINITY AND ANALOdfY. 141 

Art. VIII. — Observations upon the relationships existing amongst 
J^atural Objects, resulting from more or less perfect resemblance, 
usually termed Affinity and Analogy, By J. O. Westwood, Esq. 
F.L.S. 

In the fourteenth volume of the ' Transactions of the Linnea 
Society, ' is contained an interesting paper by the Rev. W. 
Kirby, with the title, " A Description of some Insects which 
exemplify Mr. William S. Macleay's Doctrine of Affinity and 
Analogy;" wherein the reverend author points out the confu- 
fusion which has occasionally arisen, in attempts made to 
distribute the objects of nature according to their natural rela- 
tions, in consequence of the authors of such attempts having 
no clear perception of the distinctions which exist between 
these two kinds of relations, and therefore confounding them 
together, or even occasionally giving the higher rank to rela- 
tions of analogy instead of affinity. 

Since the publication of this memoir (which was read in 
1822), and of the 'Horse Entomologicse' (one of the theories 
contained in which it was intended to ilhistrate, and which 
was published in the preceding year), much has been written 
upon thes ubject of affinity and analogy in Natural History by 
men who have brought a great share of practical knowledge, 
as well as philosophical research, to bear on the subject. 

Still however it is unquestionable that great misconception 
has existed and still exists upon this subject, owing, it is true, 
to many causes which, it is to be hoped, are gradually pass- 
ing away. The novelty of the subject, that is, as regards the 
practical distinction between these kinds of relationships, and 
their employment as respective elements in the natural distri- 
bution of animals ; the difficulty of general access to the chief 
w^orks wherein the nature of the distinctions between affinity 
and analogy are traced ; and, above all, the dislike of uproot- 
ing long-established opinions, and the substitution of others 
which required from their supporters a far more extensive ac- 
quaintance with the objects of nature than was required in 
the old works on classification ; — have tended, in a great 
measure, to prevent a general recognition of the doctrine of 
affinity and analogy. Thus some writers have maintained the 
impossibility of the existence of any relation between ani- 
mals which are not specifically related, contending that each 
is, per se, totally independent of the rest : others again, look- 
ing rather more widely at nature, perceive that as the plant 
gives support to the insect, and the insect to the bird or the 
bat, so there is a relation between these objects, which kind 
of relation, and others of a similar nature, have by these wri- 
ters been termed analogies : others again, admitting the ne- 



1 42 ON AFFINITY AND ANALOGY. 

cessity of the existence of some kind of relationship founded 
upon similarity of structure, in order to establish thereon a 
distribution whereby species are endeavoured to be arranged 
according to their greater or less similarity of organization, 
have admitted only one kind of relationship or resemblance, 
as they have termed it, regarding affinity and analogy as only 
synonymous with resemblances. 

The first and second classes of these writers may be dis- 
missed from our notice in a very few words. If we admit 
that there be a system of nature wherein animals are arranged 
and distributed, we must admit the existence of relations 
founded upon structural similarities or differences ; and these 
relations, according to their degree, constitute what have been 
termed affinity and analogy, the distinctions of which are 
overlooked by the third class of writers, who however ac- 
knowledge structural relations or resemblances. 

It appears to me, however, that notwithstanding all that 
has been said by the supporters of the doctrine of affinity and 
analogy as distinct relations, not a small share of the miscon- 
ception which has prevailed upon the subject with professed 
distributionists, has resulted from the silence of the former 
concerning what appears to me to be a fundamental principal 
in the theory, which may be stated as follows. 

Relations of affinity and analogy have their origin in more 
or less perfect resemblances of structure or habits, and are of 
comparative and relative value ; and hence that distinct rela- 
tions, both of affinity and analogy, exist between the same 
groups. 

Much has been admirably said respecting the immediate 
and the remote relations of objects, and the differences 
between their symbolical relationship and their natural affini- 
nities, whilst at the same time many excellent examples have 
been given in illustration of their distinctions. Amongst the 
latter, none have been more striking than that employed by 
Mr. Swainson in his ' Treatise upon the Natural System of 
Animals,' illustrating the relation of affinity existing between 
the swallow and the goat-sucker, and the relation of analogy 
between these and the bat. 

In applying this example as a practical illustration of the 
principle above laid down, it will scarcely be deemed neces- 
sary, in the first place, to enter into any argument to prove 
that relations of affinity, as well as of analogy, have their ori- 
gin in more or less complete resemblances of structure or 
habits : indeed, one of the most strenuous advocates of the 
doctrine in question, has observed that " every created being 
has dificrent degrees of relationship or of rcsemhlance to 



ON AFFINITY AND ANALOGY. 143 

others," constituting its relations of affinity and analogy. It 
is in consequence of the more complete resemblance in the 
numerical majority of the essential characters of the two 
beings or groups of beings contrasted together, that the rela- 
tionship becomes one of affinity ; while from a resemblance 
in the iiumerical minority of such essential characters, the 
relationship is deemed an analogy. 

In proceeding with our examination of the principle above 
stated, it will be necessary that in addition to the swallow, 
the goat-sucker, and the bat, we extend our views to the mar- 
tin, the swift, and the dragon-fly; all which are distinguished 
by their large wings when extended in action, their rapid 
motions, large mouths, and insectivorous hawking flight. 

The swallow and the martin are two birds belonging to the 
same genus {Hirundo), and resembling each other in the 
greatest possible number of their essential characters ; they 
are therefore allied together by an affinity of the first or high- 
est degree. Between these birds and the swift, a bird be- 
longing to a diff'erent genus but to the same family, we find 
an affinity of a lower, or second degree. A third or still low- 
er, is found between the goat-sucker, belonging to a different 
tribe, and the three preceding birds. Again, as vertebrated 
animals, the bat and the four birds above mentioned exhibit 
an affinity when compared with animals belonging to the four 
invertebrated sub-kingdoms, whilst as members of the animal 
kingdom, and compared with members of the vegetable king- 
dom, the dragon-fly (an invertebrated animal) and the five 
vertebrated animals above alluded to, are related together by 
affinity. 

It may however, and probably will be, said, that in the case 
of the two last-mentioned animals (the bat belonging to the Ver- 
tehrata, and the dragon-fly to the Annulosa),! am confound- 
ing analogy with affinity. I however maintain the contrary 
to be the case, asserting that these relations are strictly com- 
parative and relative; that if the relation between the swallow 
and the martin, as species respectively possessing the charac- 
ters of the next higher group (that is, genus), when compared 
with the swift or any other bird belonging to the other groups 
of the next higher rank be deemed an affinity ; or if the rela- 
tion between the swallow and the goat-sucker, founded upon 
a comparison of their joint characters as belonging to the 
higher group (Aves)^ when compared with the animals com- 
posing the other vertebrated orders (the bat for example) be 
deemed an affinity ; the relation between the bat and the 
goat-sucker, as vertebrated animals, when compared with all 
invertebrated animals (the dragon-fly for instance) must also 



144 ON AFFINITY AND ANALOGY. 

be an afRnity. In like manner the dragon-fly and the bat, 
as animals, must possess a common relation of affinity when 
compared with vegetables (the catch-fly plant for instance). 
And even between animals and vegetables as compared with 
inorganic matter, there must be a relation of affinity founded 
upon the circumstance of their organized structure. 

To show then the existence of distinct relations of analogy 
amongst these six animals of which we have thus traced the 
affinities, it will be necessary to reverse the series as well as 
the mode of comparison ; for if a relation of affinity of the 
first degree be found to exist between the species of a genus 
or sub- genus, the first degree of analogy will be found in the 
objects most widely apart, that is in those belonging to dif- 
ferent sub-kingdoms. Here then we find the bat and the 
dragon-fly, belonging to different sub-kingdoms of the animal 
kingdom (or next higher group), and we have already seen 
that as compared together with reference to the objects of the 
other next higher group (that is the vegetable kingdom), an 
affinity existed between them ; but if, on the other hand we 
regard the relations of the bat with any other animal belong- 
ing to the sa7ne sub-kingdom as itself ( Vertebrata, the goat- 
sucker for instance), we find the relation between the bat and 
the dragon-fly to be so comparatively remote, that we term it 
a relation of analogy. In like manner, if we compare the 
goat-sucker with any other animal belonging to the same ver- 
tebrated class as itself (birds, the swallow for instance), we 
find the relation between either of these animals and any other 
animals belonging to the other divisions [Reptilia, Pisces, 
Mammalia, the bat for example) composing the next higher 
group ( Vertebrata) to be one of analogy, as indeed Mr. Swain- 
son has truly regarded it ; but by pursuing this train of rea- 
soning, it will be equally evident that the relation between 
the goat-sucker and the swallow, in comparison with that be- 
tween the latter and the martin, is merely one of analogy and 
not of affinity. 

In like manner we say that all the insects belonging to an 
order (the Coleoptera for example), are related to each other 
by affinity, as compared with the other orders of insects ; but 
when we come to analyze the order Coleoptera, we find innu- 
merable analogies existing amongst those very insects which 
we have just previously admitted to possess a general affinity 
with each other. 

It has long appeared to me to be most probable, that the 
fact of two animals or groups of animals thus exhibiting rela- 
tions both of affinity and analogy, was the chief cause which 
induced many persons to regard both these relations as of 
equivalent value, and as synonymous with resemblances. 



REDUCTION OF POSTAGE. — VOYAGE OF THE BLOSSOM. 145 



THE 

MAGAZINE OF NATURAL HISTORY. 

MARCH, 1840. 

The penny-postage rate, thanks to Mr. Rowland Hill, has now become 
the order of the day. Of its benefits, we can speak feelingly, for the long 
array of contributions whose titles grace each volume of this journal, 
has involved no insignificant patronage of Her Majesty's establishment 
in St. Martin's le Grand. Not that we have been treated otherwise than 
most liberally by our correspondents in the matter of postage, for the 
cases have been rare indeed that a letter has come to hand unfranked 
by the sender. It has been in the outward bound despatches where we 
have felt so crippled by the impost. Now if we wish to communicate 
with our contributors, in the most distant part of the kingdom, we can 
do it as often as we please, without a calculation as to what it may cost 
us to attain our object. We have no longer to send our ounce despatches 
to some M.P., with a respectful hint that by franking them to their res- 
pective destinations, he will be serving us, and serving science at the 
same time. Natural History has indeed received a boon, and we should 
be ungrateful, did we not offer some acknowledgment to the talent and 
boldness, displayed in the first bringing forward a measure, which the 
voice of the country has since so triumphantly carried into efiect. 

The long looked-for and long despaired-of ' Zoology of Beechey's voy- 
age' is at last before us. Its merits as a scientific work will be duly no- 
ticed in another place ; on this occasion we shall merely say a word touch- 
ing a passage, which greatly helps to fill out the preface. Sir William 
Beechey, after doing justice to the labours of several distinguished men 
of science, by acknowledging the obligation he is under to them for their 
co-operation in getting up the descriptive portion of the volume, thus 
proceeds. — 

"I wish I could with sincerity have included with the above-mention- 
" ed names that of Mr. J. E. Gray, who undertook to describe the shells, 
" but the publication has suff'ered so much by delay in consequence of his 
" having been connected with it, that it is a matter of the greatest regret 
" to me that I ever acceded to his offer to engage in it. This delay has 
" from various causes, been extended over a period of eight years, and I 
" cannot with justice or propriety conceal from the government, the col- 
" lectors, and especially from the contributors to the work, whose MSS. 
" have been so long printed, that it has been occasioned entirely bv Mr. 
Vol. IV.— No. 39. n. s. r 



14G ZOOLOGY OF BEECHEY's VOYAGE. 

" Gray's failing to furnish his part, in spite of every intercession from my- 
" self and others : promising his MS. from time to time, and thereby keep- 
" ing the department in his own hands, yet always disappointing the print- 
" er, until at length, from other causes, the publisher (Mr. Richter) fell 
" into difficulties, and all the plates and letter-press were sold by the as- 
" signees, and lost to the government. 

" The plates and sheets thus dispersed were however with difficulty and 
" at considerable expense brought together, by the spirited conduct of the 
" present publisher, Mr. H. G. Bohn ; who, anxious that the work should 
" if possible be completed, again applied to Mr. Gray, but much against 
" my wishes. That gentleman however repeated his offer of assistance, but 
" as before it served only to delay the work anotheryear. At length Mr. 
" G. B. Sowerby was engaged to complete the Conchology, and to revise 
" the unprinted portion of Mr. Gray's MSS., and thus after an unpre- 
'* cedented and vexatious delay, and with a considerable additional ex- 
" pense, I am now only able to submit the work to the public." 

Now if naturalists, either knowingly or through inadvertence, so place 
themselves, as to stand committed, they must not expect to enjoy a mono- 
poly of exemption from the natural consequences ; but must take their 
chance with the race of ordinary mortals. It is for the interest of sci- 
ence, equally with that of society, that misdemeanours should not pass 
altogether unregarded, however high may be the names with which they 
stand connected. We do not, therefore, impute blame to Sir William 
Beechey, on the score of what he has said in assigning a cause for the 
long period during which the work has been forthcoming, although 
every one must regret that he should have felt himself under the neces- 
sity of passing such severe comments upon one of the officers attached 
to the British Museum ; but we have an objection to offer to the shape 
in which these strictures are presented to our notice. The statement is 
purely an ex parte one, for it comes before us, through a channel which 
affords the party criminated no opportunity of reply. Mr. Gray appears 
as the avowed author of one portion of the volume, and as such, we con- 
ceive that he was, beyond all dispute, entitled to a copy of the indict- 
ment prior to its publication, with the liberty of defending himself, if he 
thought proper. For aught we know, this step may have been taken, but 
we assume that it was not, as no intimation of such course having been 
followed, is affixed to the article in question. 

On our first and hasty look through the work, to gain a mere insight 
into the nature of its contents, our attention was caught by a passage 
occurring in Mr Gray's introductory remarks to the Malacological de-

written, we presume, some considerable time since, and is as follows : — 
" In the following memoranda I have given such observations as I have 
" been enabled to make on the animals of the various genera, brought home 
" either by Captain Beechey's expedition, or by several other voyagers, as 
" Captain Lord Byron, Mr. Fryer, and the Rev. Mr. Hennah, who about 
" the same time touched at several parts of the world, which were also vis- 
" ited by this expedition. I have been induced to follow this course, rather 
" than to give only a description of the new species discovered by the offi- 
" cers of the expedition, (as it was my intention to have done when first 
" the specimens were put into my hands), because Mr. Sowerby and Mr. 
" Broderip, almost immediately on the return of the expedition, described 
"many of the new and interesting species discovered during the voyage, 
" specimens of most of which were given to the Zoological Society by 
"Lieutenant (now Captain) Belcher, one of the officers of Captain 
" Beechey's ship. In my MSS. 1 had given names to most of the species, 
" but I have since substituted those used by the above-mentioned gentle- 
" men, that science might not be burthened by the many useless names 
" which an opposite course would have produced. 

" I have only given a zoological description of the animals ; as accord - 
" ing to the rules of the British Museum, we are very properly forbidden 
" to dissect the animals under our charge, which might thereby be render- 
" ed useless for subsequent observers." 

Any one at all conversant with Zoological etiquette, upon reading the 
above extract, will not fail to detect a flaw on the side of Sir William 
Beechey. We can readily understand the annoyance it must have occa- 
sioned Mr, Gray, to find himself anticipated in the describing the new 
Testacea, brought home in the ' Blossom,' when he had commenced the 
drawing up those descriptions himself. It may be argued that Sir Wil- 
liam Beechey could not be answerable for an officer of the ship's com- 
pany, giving to the Zoological, or any other Society, specimens which 
might be duplicates of those in his [Sir Wm. Beechey's] possession ; but 
it should be borne in mind that the expedition was a Government aff'air, 
and a sum of money being granted to put the public in possession of 
the scientific results of that expedition, and the Malacological portion 
of the Natural History department, being consigned to an officer in the 
British Museum, an understanding surely ought to have been entered 
into, by which the result just mentioned might have been guarded 
against. Precisely the same thing might have happened with the novel- 
ties in the other branches of Natural History, for there are plenty of 
channels open to the speedy publication of the characters and proposed 
names of new species ; and the respective authors of each separate sec-

tion, might thus not only have been anticipated, but the value of the 
work itself greatly diminished. We know nothing of the history of this 
matter, beyond that which we can gather from the statements now quo- 
ted, and the second of these is apparently written without reference to the 
first; the possible relation which the one may bear to the other, being 
purely a matter of assumption on our part. We do not notice this 
circumstance, for the purpose of showing up the errors of Mr. Gray, or 
those of Sir Wm. Beechey, and striking a balance between them, but 
because we have seen too much of ex parte statements, and have too 
often been subject to them ourselves, not to deal out justice with an even 
hand, when the opportunity lies in our power, and a legitimate occasion 
comes before us. 

We have the satisfaction of stating that the one hundred and sixth 
number of the ' Mineral Conchology of Great Britain,' has really made 
its appearance, for we have a copy now lying on our table. The author 
has therefore redeemed the pledge to that effect, which he put forth a 
short time since in the pages of the ' Magazine of Natural History.' 
The most gratifying circumstance that could possibly have come before 
us, in connection with this publication, is that of the Council of the 
Geological Society having just awarded to Mr. Sowerby, the proceeds of 
the Wollaston Donation Fund, as an aid towards the immediate contin- 
uation of a work, which bears so important a relation to our knowledge 
of the British fossiliferous deposits. The materials now in hand, for 
carrying forward the ' Mineral Conchology' are so extensive, and promise 
to accumulate so rapidly, that we trust there will be no impediment in 
the way of its regular appearance, but that Mr. Sowerby may receive 
from the hands of English naturalists, a share of support which shall 
show their due appreciation of the value of his labors ; and that, without 
infringing on the boundary of justice towards himself or his family, he 
may be enabled to go on, so long as he shall have health and strength 
to engage in the undertaking. 

It is generally understood that Mr. Children has resigned his post at 
the British Museum, and that his valuable library and entomological 
collection is shortly to come to the hammer. Whoever may be ap- 
pointed to fill the vacancy thus occasioned, will we trust have, like his 
predecessor, other attainments to grace the station than only those ari- 
sing from a profound acquaintance with zoological science. 



HABITS OF THE WATER SHREW. 149 

SHORT COMMUNICATIONS. 

Habits of the Water-Shrew^ [Sorex fodiens), as observed 
near Ipswich. — Whilst walking by the side of the river Gip- 
ping, in May, 1838, between Ipswich and the village of 
Sproughton, my attention was arrested by several water-shrews 
actively engaged in a dyke that runs parallel to the river. — 
These little creatures were in such rapid motion on the water, 
that its surface was thrown into a state of quick undulation, 
though the dyke was at least four feet wide. At times they 
would be upon the surface moving at a rapid rate between 
the blades of the aquatic plants, consisting principally of 
Sparganiu7n ramosum and simplex, that grew from the bot- 
tom, — then they would dive, and for a while remain beneath, 
but always on returning to the top, displaying the greatest 
rapidity in their movements. Whilst above water they were 
constantly repeating their faint, though shrill, tremulous 
squeak, which appeared as though expressive of pleasurable 
sensations. 

On visiting the spot the following evening, and secreting 
myself, I had an opportunity of remarking the movements of 
these little animals on land. 

I found beneath a slightly hanging bank, and close by the 
water side, a long gallery, which, though in a great measure 
naturally formed, yet much had been done by the shrews to 
render it a convenient viaduct between one hunting-place and 
another : the grasses and other plants had been removed, as 
well as, here and there, small portions of earth, in order to 
render this passage, in their movements from end to end, as 
commodious as possible. I observed the shrews continually 
passing backwards and forwards through this passage, which 
enabled them to travel with facility from one part of the ditch 
to another, and which was principally a little above the wa- 
ter level, but at intervals there were depressions at which the 
water passed on tcf, or over its floor This passage was evi- 
dently the common property of many shrews, as several were 
continually running backwards and forwards, along its whole 
extent, and ultimately taking to the water, swimming up or 
down the ditch, diving, and performing various evolutions in 
search of their insect prey. They swim upon or under the 
surface of the water with equal rapidity, and when beneath, 
the hair upon their bodies so completely repels the water, 
that the air entangled amongst the hair gives to the bodies of 
the little animals the brilliancy of silver, as they pursue their 
course ; on emerging from the water the coat appears per- 
fectly dry, but this is further ensured by the little creature

giving itself a sudden shake on arriving at its landing place. 
I remarked that in travelling along the above-mentioned gal- 
lery, the tremulous shriek is always heard when two shrews 
happen to pass each other ; and the same thing occurs, al- 
though not so invariably, in their movements in the water. — 
When a shrew secured an insect it quitted the water, and as- 
cended a convenient stone, or projecting root of a tree, clod 
of earth, or some other similar body, where at its leisure it 
devoured its prize, steadying the insect with its fore paws, 
whilst it nibbled, apparently with the greatest enjoyment, one 
or other of its extremities. 

These animals are generally infested with an immense num- 
ber of Acari, which, after the death of the shrew, leave the 
surface of the skin and come to the extremity of the hairs, 
where to the naked eye they appear like white dust. I once 
traced a pair of shrews into a small hole in a bank by the 
side of the ditch where I had been in the habit of observing 
them ; and in order to try and secure them I carefully remov- 
ed the earth, when I found that although the entrance was 
scarcely larger than just to allow of two shrews passing toge- 
ther, yet it led into a very capacious vestibule, with galleries 
leading one into another, and so extensive that there was no 
possibility of ascertaining their full extent without removing 
the greater portion of the bank. — JV. Barnard Clarke, M.D.

Calosoma sycophanta. — At the meeting of the Entomolo- 
gical Club on Thursday the 20th February, Mr. J. F. Christy 
exhibited and presented a fine specimen of this beautiful in- 
sect. It was found by Mr. Rutter, on the grass-plot opposite 
Arundel Terrace, Kemp Town, Brighton : when taken it was 
not only alive, but very active. Two other specimens were 
taken by a little girl at Brighton during the summer of 1838, 
and were purchased by Mr. Hoyer. A single individual was 
found by Mr. Bennett on the 20th of June 1839, at Ramsgate, 
on the chalk cliff; it was kept alive more than a month, and ate 
caterpillars greedily. Three specimens were found during the 
past summer at Hastings, by Mr. Hanson or some of his fa- 
mily : one was living and active, the others dead, and lying 
on the sea-shore. We have thus abundant evidence that this 
fine insect is really British, and, as far as my observations 
have extended, it appears to be confined to the south-eastern 
and southern shores of England ; its range extending along 
the coast from Norfolk to Cornwall. 1 think it right to add 
that numerous French and German specimens are being hawk- 
ed about by dealers at a very low price, and are warranted 
genuine Britons, and taken near Norivich, — Edwd. Newman.

SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE. 

THE Microscopical Society of London held their first meeting on 
Wednesday, January 29th, at the Horticultural Society's Rooms, No. 
21, Regent St. The meeting was attended by upwards of a hundred 
members and visitors. 

The President, Prof. Owen, announced that since the provisional 
meeting on the 20th of December, for the purpose of forming the So- 
ciety, the number of members had encreased to one hundred and ten ; 
and a further addition of twenty-nine names was announced in the 
course of the evening, making a total of one hundred and thirty -nine 
original members of the Society. (It having been determined that 
those who joined the Society on or before the first night of meeting, 
should be considered original members). 

Mr. Owen communicated a paper 'On the application of microscopic 
examinations of the structure of teeth to the determination of fossil 
remains.' After alluding to the essential service rendered by the mi- 
croscope to the chemist, mineralogist, and vegetable physiologist, he 
proceeded to offer a few examples of the utility of the microscope to 
the geologist, when applied to the investigation of the structure of fos- 
silized teeth. 

The first example adduced was that of the Saurocephalus, an ex- 
tinct fossil animal which had been referred to the class of Reptiles. — 
After pointing out the distinctive characters of the microscopic texture 
of the teeth in reptiles and fishes, it was shown that the Saurocephalus, 
according to this test, unquestionably belonged to the latter class, and 
that it most closely resembled the Sphyrcena, among recent fishes, in 
its dental structure. 

The second instance was the Basilosaurus of Dr. Harlan, which had 
been referred to the class Reptilia, and the double-fanged structure of 
its teeth had, on the strength of its supposed saurian affinities, been 
adduced to weaken the arguments in favour of the mammiferous nature 
of certain fossils from the Stonesfield oolite. Mr. Owen, after describ- 
ing the microscopic characters of the teeth of the Basilosaurus, showed 
that it deviated from the saurian structure in this respect, as widely as 
the Saurocephalus, but that the modification of its dental structure 
resembled most closely that of the cachalot and herbivorous Cetacea. 

Lastly, Mr. Owen alluded to the difference in the views entertained 
by Cuvier and M. de Blainville as lo the affinities of the Megatherium, 
which was referred by the one to the family of the sloths, and by the 
other to that of the armadilloes : after explaining the well-marked dif- 
ferences in the microscopic characters of the dental structure in these 
two families of the so-called Edentata, Mr. Owen proceeded to describe 
the structure of the teeth of the Megatherium, and to show that in its 
close resemblance to the dental structure of the sloths, it confirmed the 
views of the great founder of the science of fossil remains. 

Mr. Jackson then read a short paper, drawing the attention of the 
Society to a mode of mounting the compound microscope, which dif- 
fers in some particulars from the methods generally adopted. The 
principal object to be kept in view in the construction of this instrument 



152 SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE. 

is the prevention of tliose accidental vibrations wliicli so much interfere 
with microscopical examinations, especially in the neighbourhood of 
crowded thoroughfares. This object is effected by connecting together 
the body and stage of the instrument, in such a manner that whatever 
vibrations are communicated to the one shall be equally communicated 
to the other. In Mr. Jackson's instrument this principle has been car- 
ried farther than had hitherto been effected; and it also affords improved 
facilities for minute adjustment, and the accurate admeasurement of 
microscopic objects. 

The second meeting of this Society was held on Wednesday, the 
19th of February; R. H. Solly, Esq., in the chair. 

A paper was read by Mr. Quekett, ' On the development of the vas - 
cular tissue of plants ; ' in which it was shown that the membranous 
tube of vessels originated from a cytoblast, in a manner similar to that 
described by Schleiden in the formation of cells. Before the fibre is 
deposited, the contents, which are gelatinous, are crowded with numer- 
ous most minute granules, which possess the motion known in *' active 
molecules: " and after a short time, when they have become a little en- 
larged, they adhere to the inner surface of the tube containing them, in 
a different manner for each vessel ; so that the several varieties of vas- 
cular tissue are not degenerations of any other kind, but are each con- 
structed originally on the plan they are always observed to present to 
the eye. 

It had been conjectured by Schleiden that a cuiTent existed between 
the gelatinous contents of the cell and its walls, which cun^ent preceded 
the formation of a fibre, and gave the direction it afterwards took ; this 
was refuted by showing that the granules become separately attached 
to the inside of the vessel, a short distance from each other, beginning 
first at one end and proceeding to the opposite one ; the fibre elongat- 
ing like a root by the materials of growth being always added to the 
point. The granules so attached become nourished by the contents of 
the vessel, and the spaces between them are in a short time obliterated 
by the fibre acquiring a defined border, which completes its development. 

This act is the one observed in the formation of all vessels ; but the 
arrangement of the granules differs, so as to constitute the several va- 
rieties. In the annular vessel the granules attach themselves horizon- 
tally, forming rings ; — in the spiral they become inclined, and by 
continuing this direction around the interior of the membranous tube 
the peculiar character of this vessel is obtained : — in the reticulated, 
for each division or branch of the fibre, a gi'anule becomes enlarged in 
the line, and forms the starting-place for the fresh direction of the fibre. 
In the dotted and scalariform vessels, the fibres become so reticulated 
as to leave portions of the outer membrane of the vessel without any 
deposit within; and this spot so left constitutes the dot or linear 
marking seen on these vessels. 

This dot is plain in all such kinds of vessels, excepting those found 
in woody exogens, where it possesses (from a slight difference of struc- 
tm'e), a central mark analogous to that on the woody tissue of coni- 
ferous plants, with which Mr. Quekett considered it identical, only of 
a smaller size.

Art. I. — View o/fha Fauna of Brazil, anterior to the last Geologi- 
cal Revolution. By Dr. Lund. 

(Con tinned from page 112.^ 

I NOW pass on to the most abundant of the extinct genera of 
the Ai'tnadillo tribe, whose numerous remains, in several 
cases, have enabled me to determine with accuracy its place 
in the family, as well as its relations to existing species. 
This animal constitutes, in many points, a perfectly connect- 
ing link between the genera Dasypus and Euphractus ; but in 
other points it differs from all living genera of this family. 
Like Dasypus, it has only four toes on the fore-foot ; and 
the construction of its fore and hind feet is very much the 
same in all the principal characters : except that the bones 
are much shorter, and the claws broader. On the other hand, 
the remaining bones of its extremities, as also those of its 
body, correspond in the most striking manner with those of 
Euphractus ; which it moreover resembles in the structure 
of its corslet. 

In connection with these remarkable correspondences to 
existing genera, one cannot help being greatly astonished at 
the entirely dissimilar structure of the dental system, pre- 
sented by the fossil species, and which compels us to ascribe 
to this animal totally different habits and food, from those 
which we know to belong to the living species. With re- 
spect to the habits of these latter great contradictions occur, 
not only in the works on natural history, but even in the 
accounts I have collected from the natives. The country-

men destroy them as being injurious to their maize, gourds, 
&c., while those which I kept in my house ^ invariably 
showed an aversion to all such vegetable productions ; but 
on the other hand, exhibited an extraordinary predilection for 
putrid flesh, as well as a remarkable skill in managing it. 
When the morsel is too large to be swallowed whole, they 
take it between the front teeth, and then work it with the 
claws of the fore-feet with such incredible rapidity, that in a 
moment it is riven asunder, and thus swallowed piecemeal. 
I have always found in the stomachs of those that 1 have 
examined, numerous remains of insects, particularly beetles 
and Scolopendras ; together with a fine pulp, the nature of 
which I have not been able to determine. Hence we see 
that the modern armadillos are insectivorous and carnivorous : 
and in truth, the masticating surface of their teeth seems 
much better adapted to cut their food than to grind it. In the 
fossil species the upper jaw has eight teeth on each side, 
and the lower nine ; of these, the two firont in the upper jaw, 
and the three front in the lower, are incisors. The latter 
are shaped like small cylinders of a more or less reniform 
section ; while the molars are very large, and compressed 
longitudinally, so that their section resembles an elonga- 
ted kidney. Their lateral surface is marked with several 
canaliculated impressions, and their grinding surface pre- 
sents two projections, the effect of the indentation of the 
teeth of the opposed jaw. In other respects it is flat, or even 
a little hollowed in the middle, as in the sloths ; so that in 
all the principal points, these teeth are constructed on the 
same plan as those of a Megalonyx, and are evidently suited 
to grind, and not to cut: hence we may conclude, with a 
high degree of probability, that vegetable substances were 
their appointed food. I propose the name of Chlamydothe- 
rium for this extinct genus ; and to the species which is as 
yet the best known, I would venture to add the name of the 
first modern naturalist, by calling it Chlam. Humholdtii. Its 
length, from the point of the snout to the root of the tail, is 
six feet; its size, therefore, is double that of the largest 
existing armadillo, or about equal to that of the tapir. 

I have found, also, the remains of another species, though 
much less frequently than the above, which I have named 
Chlam. giganteum, on account of its vast size, in which it 
was certainly not inferior to the Rhinoceros ; and it surpasses 
all I have yet discovered of the entire order Bruta. 

» This was the case even with the o^enus Dasypus^ Wagl., to which the 
opposite of such habits is usually attributed. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 155 

The next genus, with only one species of which I am ac- 
quainted, carries us still farther towards the confines of the 
armadillo family ; and surprises us with characters hitherto 
considered peculiar to the sloths. This astonishing monster 
combines, with the size of an ox, a coat of mail, most like 
that of Tolypeutes, but of astounding thickness, and extre- 
mities fashioned nearly after the form of the armadillo, with 
short thick feet, and with immensely broad and short claws, 
which must have given its foot almost the appearance of that 
of an elephant or hippopotamus. It has the sloth's head, with 
the same characteristic structure of the zygoma. Its teeth 
are shaped like the molars of the Capivar, but have a dif- 
ferent structure, inasmuch as they are simple, and not com- 
posed of laminae. In the details of its internal structure, it 
presents, besides, several peculiarities not observed in any 
other animal. I call this remarkable animal ^ Hoplophorus 
Euphractus. 

Finally, I conclude my list of this family with a genus, 
which, from the little I yet know of it, seems to offer so com- 
plete a passage into the next family, that it will require more 
perfect specimens to decide to which of them it belongs. 
The general characters of its feet are those of the armadillo ; 
but so shortened and thickened, and with such massive 
proportions, that I cannot resist indicating this genus, for the 
present, by the name of Pachytherium. It seems to have 
been of the same size as the preceding, or rather larger ; but 
I have not hitherto found any trace of its having had a coat 
of armour. 

Armadilloes are now confined to this portion of the globe ; 
and we see from the above short sketch, that they also inha- 
bited this district in the previous geological period. No trace 
of these animals in the fossil state having hitherto been dis- 
covered in the old world, we may conclude with certainty, 
that the geographical distribution of this genus was the same 
then as now. We shall have further opportunities of esta- 
blishing this fact in the course of our enquiries. But not 
only did this group of animals exist here in former times; it was 
also richer in subordinate forms and species than it now is. 
If we examine more closely the generic forms that formerly 
composed this family, we find that one of them [Dasypus, 
Wagl.), still exists, but that the remaining five are extinct. 
And although there are good grounds for suspecting that a 
more accurate acquaintance with the fossils of this district 
will bring to light more existing generic forms of this family, 

' Named by Professor Owen, Ghjptodon. 



156 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

still we may assert generally, tliat notwithstaiidiiig the con- 
tinuance of this group of mammals in this region from that 
ancient period, betokens a similarity with the existing fauna, 
as far as regards fundamental types, still there is a visible dif- 
ference in the details of its composition, and in its subordi- 
nate generic forms. With regard to the species of this 
family, the greater number of them in those former ages 
exhibited gigantic forms ; while those now existing are all 
small animals, scarcely one reaching the middle size. We 
may therefore conclude that this family, as now existing, 
when compared with what it formerly was, is developed on 
a reduced scale, as well with reference to the number of 
genera and species, as to the size of individuals. 

Third Family, Tardigrades, Sloths. 

Two genera of this family, both now extinct, formerly in- 
habited this district. The first of these I have spoken of in 
my account of the Cave of Maquine, under the name of 
Megathe7'mm ; but subsequent investigations have satisfied 
me that it should be separated from that genus. It has four 
molars in the upper, and three in the lower jaw. The teeth 
are somewhat compressed cylinders, with an even grinding 
surface ; which, however, by trituration becomes hollowed in 
the middle, so as to be surrounded by a continually increasing 
margin, whi^h, by the action of the teeth of the opposed 
jaw, usually has some iiTegular indentations. These teeth 
consist of an outer crust, composed of osseous laminw, partly 
superimposed obhquely, and disposed one over the other, 
without any immediate contact, like the plates in a Voltaic 
pile. The teeth are fixed obliquely in the jaw ; and the last 
molar of the upper jaw is distinguished from the rest by 
being much smaller, and of a different shape. For this ani- 
mal, which, in the structure of its teeth, approaches nearer 
to the three-toed sloth than to the Megatherium^ I propose, 
for the present, the generic name Ccelodon. I only know one 
species, about the size of the tapir ; and which, from the 
spot where it was found, I call Ccel. Maquinense. 

The second genus of this family, which I now proceed to 
describe, has been much longer known. It was discovered 
and first described by President Jefferson, who took it for a 
predatory animal ; but Cuvier was the first to determine its 
proper place among the sloths, under the name of Megalonyx. 
But its connection with the other animals of that order was so 
obscure, from the imperfect state of the fragments, that Pan- 
der and Dalton, who have described and figured the skeleton 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 157 

of the great Megatherium on the spot, considered the animal 
described by Jefferson as specifically identical. 

The numerous remains which several species of this genus 
have left in the caves of Brazil, enable me not only to eluci- 
date this point in science, but also to throw some light on the 
habits of this very remarkable animal, so different from any 
now living. 

The Megalonyx forms a genus perfectly distinct from the 
Megatherium. It resembles, nay exceeds, the latter, in the 
thick clumsy shape of its body. The construction of the 
fore and hind feet is the same ; but in the formation of its 
head, and particularly in the number, shape, and position of 
its teeth, it differs greatly. The Megalonyx has five molars 
in the upper, and four in the lower jaw. The teeth are flat- 
tened cylinders, somewhat curved, both in a longitudinal 
and transverse direction, and inserted obliquely in the jaws : 
they present a rather excavated grinding surface, the margin 
of which is notched at one end. The posterior molar of the 
under jaw has a somewhat consolidated aspect, as if it were 
formed by the union of two. Like the Megatherium^ it had 
a long and strong tail, composed of many vertehrce, and ex- 
traordinarily powerful, especially at its root. Its ribs are 
grooved longitudinally along its external surface ; a character 
only observed in some species of Dasypus. However, as it 
is not my object to give here a detailed description of this 
animal, I will confine myself to the general observation, that 
most of the points in which Megalonyx differs from Mega- 
therium, present so many approximations to the modern 
sloth ; one of which is of too great importance to be passed 
over without examination. It is well known that in the three- 
toed sloth, the foot articulates with the tibia, not, as in all 
other Mammalia, in a plane at right angles to the leg, but on 
a plane continuous with it ; so that if this creature wished to 
stand upright upon its four legs, it would have to rest upon the 
outer edge of the soles of its feet ; while, in order to rest 
upon the flat of the sole, it must lie on its belly, with its feet 
stretched out straight fiom its body. This peculiarity, of 
which we are as yet acquainted with only this one living ex- 
ample, is repeated in the Megalonyx, although the mechanism 
whereby this distortion, if we may so call it, is effected, dif- 
fers much in the two animals. In the sloth it is produced 
by the singular mode in which the tibia 3ind Jibula articulate 
with the astralagus ; while in the Megalonyx this joint occurs 
in the manner usual among Mammalia ; and the irregularity 
of the plane of the foot depends on the articulation of the first 
row of the metatarsal bones with the astralagus and calca-

neum ; which last, therefore, entirely differ from those of all 
other mammals, in the form and position of their anterior 
articular surfaces. 

Inasmuch as the mechanism of the sloth's movements, so 
far as I am aware, is not very well known, I may take the 
liberty of recording the observations I made on the three- 
toed sloth, Brady pus torqiiatusy which I kept in my house 
for a considerable time. This animal climbs with remark- 
able sureness and aptitude, although, as is well known, with 
a degree of slowness which, however, may be called rapidity 
in comparison with its terrestrial movements. The manner in 
which it moves is this : — Lying on its belly, with all its four 
extremities stretched out from the body ;. it first presses one 
of its hind feet with all its might against the ground, whereby 
the corresponding side of the body is a little raised. The 
fore-leg on the same side thus becomes sufficiently fi*ee for 
the animal to advance it a trifle forward. It then hooks its 
powerful claws fast in the earth, and so drags its body a little 
onwards. The same manoeuvre is next repeated on the op- 
posite side ; and thus the poor creature progresses in the 
slowest and most laborious manner possible. But this mode 
of progression requires certain conditions of the surface ; for 
if it is not soft enough to admit the insertion of the claws, 
or if there are no inequalities for them to hold by, the sloth 
is completely deprived of the power of changing its position. 
For instance, when I laid it on a table of polished mahogany, 
it could not advance the least, notwithstanding all its exer- 
tions. But in proportion as the sloth's organization unfits it 
for terrestrial progression, is it wonderfully adapted to climb- 
ing trees. With its long arms it reaches high up, and clings 
fast to the branches with its strong crooked claws. The m- 
verted position of the soles of its hind feet gives it a power 
of grasping the trunk of the tree, which no other mammal 
possesses. So that truly, when we see it climbing a tree, 
we can scarcely believe it to be the same animal that lies so 
helpless on the ground. Hence we see, that the sloth's organ- 
ization is entirely adapted for living in trees. Compared 
with the slowness of its motions, it is the best climber among 
mammals, while it is the worst walker ; or rather, it is the 
only mammal that can neither walk nor stand. These pecu- 
liarities depend on three principal points in its organiza- 
tion : — 1st, the great length of its anterior extremities, in 
comparison with the posterior ; 2dly, its powerful, crooked 
claws ; and 3dly, the irregular position of its hind feet. 

Let us now see how far the results to which we have been led 
by the consideration of the living sloth's structure and habits 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 159 

may serve to elucidate the habits of that extraordinary tenant 
of a former world, now under our consideration. Now, the 
Megalonyx^ like the sloth, is provided with powerful clavicles ; 
like it also, its anterior extremities are longer than the hind ; 
its toes are armed with immense claws ; and lastly, the sole 
of its hind foot is turned inwards instead of downwards. 

The first of these characters, or the existence of perfect 
cla\dcles, proves that this animal used its fore-extremities 
for more purposes than for walking ; which position I take 
to be incontrovertible, as it is founded on a rule that has 
no exception among mammals. The purposes for which 
mammals, provided wdth clavicles, employ their anterior 
extremities, are the following : — 1st, for flying, as in the 
bats, with which we have nothing here to do ; 2dly, for the 
apprehension of food, and the bringing it to the mouth, either 
with one hand, as in the apes, or with two, like most rodents, 
some marsupials, &c. Now, the first of these purposes re- 
quires a peculiar disposition of the fingers, and a certain 
fi-eedom of motion in them ; which conditions are both 
wanting in the Megalonyx, notwithstanding this animal, as 
well as the Megatherium, has in reality been classed by 
Wagler among apes. The second purpose is confined to ani- 
mals that have short fore-limhs, and whose dental system is 
adapted to gnaw substances which they hold in their paws ; 
which conditions being also inapplicable to the Megalonyx, 
there can be no occasion to dwell longer on them ; 3dly, for 
tearing asunder their prey, as in the feline tribes. This pur- 
pose requires only an imperfect development of the clavicles, 
but at the same time, a peculiar arrangement in the shape and 
attachment of the claws; which, again, is not the case in the 
Megalonyx. Besides, the dental system proves it to have 
been graminivorous ; although authors have not been wanting 
( as Jefferson and Faujas) who have placed it among the 
Carnivora. 

There remain, therefore, only two functions that are exer- 
cised by the animals provided with bones for the attachment 
of claws ; viz. digging and climbing. And it is the more 
necessary to confine our attention to these two points, inas- 
much as we see that all animals belonging to the same order 
as Megalonyx, exercise one or the other of these functions. 
Their immediate instruments for these pui-poses are claw^s, 
which consequently are powerfully developed in all ; but in 
none in so high degree as in the extinct genera Megalonyx 
and Megatherium : in these they have reached the highest 
degree of development we yet know in the animal kingdom. 
It would be contrary to all experience in natural history, to 



160 VIEW OF THE EXTINCT FAUNA OF BRAZIL. 

suppose that an organ should lose its function and significance 
precisely at the point where it is most perfectly developed. We 
cannot doubt, therefore, that the powerful claws with which we 
find Megalonyx and Megatherium armed, have had their use. 
We may even conclude with certainty, that the habits of 
the animals were closely connected with these organs, and 
that their very existence depended on them. Now, as we 
only know of two uses for strong claws in Mammalia^ dig- 
ging and climbing ; and as these two purposes require dif- 
ferent anatomical arrangements ; it will not be very difficult 
to decide for which of them the powerful organs in the ex- 
traordinary creatures we are considering were intended. We 
find among the animals the most perfectly organized with 
respect to burrowing, such as Talpa, Spalax, Condylurus, 
&c., that the claws are strong, long, broad, and nearly of 
equal size, that all the digits are provided with similar claws, 
and are extended in almost the same plane as the hand, 
which is of considerable breadth. Next to moles, the best 
diggers or burrowers are found in the order to which Mega- 
lonyx belongs, especially in the family Dasypus', but the 
different species of that genus are not all equally well pro- 
vided in this respect. The best diggers are the Cahassous 
{Xenurus, Priodon), among which we again recognize the 
same characters as in the moles ; a broad hand, all the digits 
provided with claws, very broad, and nearly equal. In the 
Euphractus the hand is somewhat smaller, as are also the 
claws, although their number remains undiminished ; conse- 
quently, the species of this family cannot compete with the 
former as burrowers. In the proper Dasypus, the number of 
digits provided with claws is reduced to four ; and they are 
so inferior to the first described, in the faculty of digging, 
as to avail themselves, for the most part, of the burrows the 
others have excavated. 

Let us next examine the plan of construction of the hand 
in those animals that use their claws as hooks to climb with. 
We find the most perfect form of this kind in the sloth. Its 
claws are extraordinarily long, curved and compressed : they 
are so articulated as to be incapable of extension, whence, 
during the animal's repose, they are bent under the fore 
foot ; and at the utmost, can only be extended so as to form 
a right angle with it. Again, not more than three digits in 
some, and two in others, are furnished with equal claws ; and 
the hand is small. We thus see, that hands adapted for 
climbing and burrowing, are constructed on two almost op- 
posite plans ; let us then examine to which of Ihem the Me- 
galonyx bears the most resemblance. 



ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 161 

The claws in the Megalonyx (and still more in the Mega- 
therium), were extraordinarily long; according to all ap- 
pearance, longer even than in the sloth, which has the longest 
of all existing mammals. They are neither flat-shaped, as 
in the burrowers, nor are they compressed, as in the sloth ; 
on the contrary, their dimensions as to height and breadth 
are nearly equal. They are curved longitudinally, as in the 
sloth ; and have the same peculiarity in their articular sur- 
faces, that they cannot be extended in the same plane as the 
hand. Their number, also, as in the sloth, is reduced to 
three ; a reduction we do not else find in any burrower. It 
is therefore evident, from this comparison, that the hand of 
Megalonyx was constructed rather on the plan^of the sloth 
than of the burrowers ; and that all its provisions were ill 
adapted for digging.

Art. it. — Observations on the Young of the Salmon, more par- 
ticularly on the Samlet, or small Fish found in the Wye and other 
Rivers, in the autumn months, called, in Herefordshire, " Las- 
prings, or Gravel-Lasprinys.'' By Thomas Jenkins, Esq.' 

Various opinions are entertained respecting the above-named 
fish, but up to the present time, as far as I am aware, their 
specific identity has not been clearly ascertained. I here 
particularly allude to those seen in the autumn ; all observ- 
ers agreeing that those of the spring, also called Masprings' 
in this locality, are the produce of the salmon. An opinion 
prevails in this neighbourhood that the samlets are peculiar 
to the Wye, and one or two other rivers ; so far from this 
being the case, I have myself taken them in nearly thirty 
different rivers in England and Wales, where they are known 
under the several local names of lasprings, gravel-lasprings, 
salmon-pink, salmon-smelts, samlets, par, scarlings, seals, 
smoults, gravelings, fingerlings, and small trout. 

The samlets are generally thought to constitute a species 
of themselves, not growing larger than we see them here, 
where they attain the average length of four inches ; some, 
however, entertain the opinion that they are hybrids, the pro- 
duce of the salmon with the sea-trout, or with the common 
trout ; of which latter opinion was the late Sir Humphrey 

' Read at the Soiree of the Herefordshire Natural History Society,

162 ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 

Davy : few believe them to be of the same species as their 
namesakes of the spring, that is, the salraon-fry ; but with these 
latter, however, I think I shall be able to identify them. 
I have taken samlets at the foot of several considerable 
waterfalls in Wales, whereas above those places, being be- 
yond the ascending power of the salmon, great as it is known 
to be, small trout of the same size may be taken, but not one 
samlet : were the former a distinct species, inhabiting those 
rivers the whole year, I presume they would, like the trout, 
be found above as well as below the falls ; and I will venture 
to assert, from my experience, that the autumn samlet, called 
by whatever name it may, will be met with in all rivers fre- 
quented by salmon, and in no others ; that they will be found 
as far up those rivers as the salmon go, and no farther, which 
is strong presumptive evidence of the one being the produce 
of the other. 

With regard to the milt, or soft roe, contained in samlets 
in the autumn months, this appears to be the mere germs of 
spawn not come to maturity ; and the same appearance is to 
be seen in small salmon of half-a-pound and upwards, at that 
season of the year. Indeed, the absence of the ova, or per- 
fected spawn, at any time of the year (and I have examined 
samlets in almost every month), clearly shows that they are 
not come to their full growth. But what I rely upon more 
than anything else, is, that the anatomical structure will be 
found to correspond exactly with the salmon, and the salmon- 
fry. In addition to this, the bones of the samlets are soft and 
tender, unlike those of a fish come to maturity, as may be 
seen on examining the bones of any small fish of full growth, 
a minnow, for instance. It is true, that salmon generally 
spawn at one particular time of the year, namely, December 
and January ; and it does, at first, seem rather strange, why 
the produce should appear at different times of the year ; — 
but the trout furnishes us with a similar instance ; this fish 
is known to spawn about the same time as the salmon, yet 
very small trout will be met with at all times of the year, 
without surprise to the angler : I have myself seen them less 
than minnows, in September, and also the same size in April, 
though it is clear that the young trout of September, and 
those of April, could not have been spawned at the same 
time, and I call attention to this, in reference to the spring 
and autumn samlet. Another circumstance which I will 
here mention, is, that so late as December I have taken with 
a fly, small salmon of half-a-pound each (and T trust I am 
sufficiently acquainted with these fish, to say that they be- 
longed to no other species), which, according to the rate they 



ON THE VOUNG OF THE SALMON. 163 

are known to increase in size, must have been samlets in the 
previous month, and about June must have been spawned ; 
thus accounting for the samlet, or salmon-frj, so late as No- 
vember. Indeed, I can say, that I have taken them in almost 
every month of the year ; they are by far in the greatest 
abundance in April and May, no doubt the produce of the 
general spawning time of December and January. 

I come now to the opinion, sanctioned as it is by a great 
chemist and philosopher, though, T believe, no naturalist, the 
late Sir Humphrey Davy, that the samlets are a breed between 
a salmon and sea-trout, or the common trout. With due 
deference to so high an authority, I must beg leave to say, 
that such an opinion is quite untenable ; for it is to be 
observed that both the sea-trout and salmon-trout are rare- 
ly to be met with in any of the rivers of North Wales, whereas 
in most of the salmon rivers in that part of the principality, 
I can state from experience, that the autumn-samlet will 
be found in abundance. Then, as to the common trout, in 
many of the Welsh salmon-rivers, it is rare to meet with one 
so large as two pounds in weight ; the samlet is, therefore, 
not likely to be the offspring of two fish so different in size 
as the salmon and trout ; and I may add, that these little fish 
have not even the analogy of bearing that proportion in size 
to the originals, which such deviations from nature in the 
animal creation are invariably known to possess. 



Since committing the above observations to paper, I have 
seen Mr. Yarrell's work on British Fishes, wherein an opinion 
is expressed by the author, that the samlet, or par, as it is 
there called, is a distinct species, and in this opinion he is 
joined by Sir William Jardine and Dr. Heysham, of Carlisle : 
the last-named gentleman also stating that the samlets spawn 
in December and January, going down to the sea in the 
spring, and returning in the autumn ; but how he comes to 
this conclusion does not appear. Before these fish are ex- 
posed to indiscriminate destructiouj on the above authority, 
and not preserved as the young of the salmon ought to be, 
I must be allowed, on behalf of the salmon species in general, 
though not a specially retained advocate, to make a few further 
observations in their behalf: and, diff'ering so widely as I do 
from three such distinguished and experienced naturalists, it 
will be necessary for me to go into more minute details in 
support of my own conclusions, and to which I will beg to 
claim further attention. 

I have first to remark, that in an exaiiftination of nearly 



164 ON THE YOUNG OF THK SALMON. 

400 individuals, made at different times, by Dr. Heysham, 
that gentleman does not say that the ova were perfectly 
formed in any one out of that number; that he was able to 
distinguish the male from the female spawn may be possible. 
There are, however, two, mentioned by Mr. Yarrell as having 
contained ova, but these, it is to be remarked, in March, at a 
time the salmon-fry are known to be in the rivers ; so that al- 
though they are set down as spawning in December and Janu- 
ary, yet the only two ever said to contain full-sized roe, were ta- 
ken nearly three months afterwards, and had not then spawned. 
The size of these fish, I observe, is not stated, but mention 
is made of one seven inches in length, with the roe said to 
be in a forward state. Now this is nearly double the usual 
size of the samlet, and although I have taken this fish in 
twenty-eight different rivers, I have never met with one of 
that size which had not been to the salt water, and shown 
itself as a complete young salmon ; and of that size they 
will only be found in or near the estuaries. The question 
therefore arises, what fish these were ? I would ask, were the 
number of vertehrcB examined ? Might they not possibly 
have been young trout, to which the samlet bears an external 
resemblance ? I am not aware at how small a size a salmon 
might contain mature ova, but I will just observe, that I have 
seen a trout of not more than three ounces, containing full- 
sized spawn, although that fish is known to attain a size oc- 
casionally of fifteen or twenty pounds. It is admitted that 
samlets have never been seen spawning in the rivulets and 
shallow streams, like trout, and I can confidently say, there 
is no evidence of their spawning at all, whilst their dimen- 
sions are such as are given to this assumed species. I have 
myself examined some hundreds of samlets, at various times 
of the year, and particularly about the end of September, at 
which time I have generally found the greatest accumulation 
of roe, or rather milt, for it has that appearance, and it ap- 
peared to me, that if they spawned at all, they spawned 
about that time, but I have never been able to discover 
any appearance of ova ; and in October and November, so 
near the period at which they are said to spawn, when 
a more forward appearance would be expected, I have 
especially remarked that they have not been so full. As 
the samlets are said to spawn in December and January, 
this is a time of year unfavourable to angling, and few ex- 
aminations can then be made, either to prove or disprove 
the fact. I have, however, taken two on the 12th of January, 
and if the samlet contained spawn at that time, the proba- 
bility is, that one of these, at least, would have been a 



ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 165 

spawner, but that was not the case ; they both contained the 
soft roe, which, on their being handled, came from them of 
a thick cream-like appearance. These two fish, which ought 
then to have attained their full growth, they had been distinct 
species, were under the usual size. It becomes a question, 
whether or not this accumulation does not disappear sponta- 
neously, as just mentioned, at that season of the year, and 
that the same accumulation may take place at the usual sea- 
son in the following year, and become perfected spawn when 
the fish attains a size adapted for maturing it. Whether this 
be the case or not, it must be admitted that such an accumu- 
lation of milt as is to be seen in these fish in the autumn, is 
extraordinary, and is the only circumstance, as far as it goes, 
that has come under my observation, in favour of the opinion 
that the samlet is a distinct species. 

That these fish go down to the sea, I have no doubt ; it is 
the natural instinct of the young of the salmon to do so ; but 
that they return again the same size as they go down (as is 
asserted by Dr. Heysham), I must utterly deny to be practi- 
cable in the situations where I have found them, and which I 
think will appear from what I shall have to say on this point. 
They are to be taken as far up the river Wye as Llangerig, 
eight miles above Rhayader; and, independently of the dis- 
tance being nearly 200 miles by water, they would have a 
cataract to surmount, above the bridge at Rhayader, of about 
three feet, with numerous other falls and rapids ; I believe I 
may assert, that there is no instance in the history of fishes 
of so small a size, taking yearly, such a voyage in the fresh 
water, to say nothing of its impracticability. 

Near the celebrated pass of Pont Aberglaslyn, in Carnar- 
vonshire, the river becomes a roaring cataract during the 
course of half a mile, falling over ledges of rock, varying 
from one to four feet ; and at the mill at Beddgelert, a mile 
higher up the same river, is a weir of two to three feet, where 
I have witnessed a fish, nearly a pound weight, fail in its 
attempt to ascend. The ascent, therefore, is not likely to be 
accomplished by a fish weighing scarcely two ounces, inde- 
pendently of the cataracts mentioned below; yet, I have 
taken samlets in the river, above the weir, in the lake of 
Llyn-y-Dinas ; and in the same river, as far up the vale of 
Gwynant as the foot of Snowdon. They are also to be taken 
in the Ogwen, in the vale of Nant-Frangon, as far up that 
river as Mr. Pennant's slate quarries, which is as high as 
the salmon go, and no further, being there stopped by a fall 
of about sixteen feet ; to go thus far, they have to ascend 
innumerable rocks and falls, such as could only be surmounted 



160 ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 

by the salmon, or other large fish. Near Bangor Iscoed, on 
the Dee, is a weir of such a height as to prevent all salmon 
under three or four pounds from ascending ; at Llangollen, 
below the bridge, is a weir of about six feet, and two miles 
above, is another weir, of about three feet, with several natu- 
ral falls and rapids on the same river : yet 1 have taken sam- 
lets in September, some miles above the highest of these 
weirs, and also in the Alwen, a tributary of the Dee, near 
Corwen. That these little fish can surmount the difficulties 
here enumerated, must be considered impossible, and their 
existence can only be accounted for in those situations, by 
admitting them to be the young of the salmon. 

It is acknowledged that the fish in dispute are peculiar 
to our salmon-rivers, as I have before remarked, and not one 
single river in theUnited Kingdom is pointed out as containing 
the one, that does not also contain the other. It is, however, 
said, that samlets are to be found in some streams in the 
Western Isles, in which salmon are not. The Western Isles, 
I must say, are rather remote from observation, and that mis- 
takes may occur in assertions of this kind, from our not being 
sufficiently informed, the following circumstance will show. 
Being fishing in the month of September, in the Ceiriog, 
four miles south of Llangollen, amongst the few trout I had 
taken, was a fish which I immediately recognized as the 
autumn- samlet, and which I considered as a proof that this 
river was fi-equented by salmon ; although I had previously 
been informed such was not the case, the salmon being 
stopped by a weir somewhere about Chirk ; however, on 
fishing a few days later, lower down the same river, I learnt 
that a salmon had been taken there the day before, although 
it was acknowledged to be a rare circumstance. Now, a 
person relying on the first information, might have set down 
that river as not containing salmon. I have taken the au- 
/wm/z-samlet in twenty-eight different rivers, and have never 
met with one salmon-river without them; nor have I ever 
found them in any river unfrequented by salmon ; and if the 
branches of any considerable river be examined, there will 
be found many small rivers adapted to fishes of this small 
size, yet only in those branches containing salmon, will these 
fish be found. I must observe, on the assertion that samlets, 
having been spawned in the winter (as is said by Dr. Hey- 
sham), do not come to their full growth till late in the au- 
tumn, thus taking nine months to attain a size of barely two 
ounces ; I believe there is no instance of fishes of so small 
a size taking so long a time in coming to maturity, and such 
a circumstance is contrary to the order of nature ; for the 



ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 167 

salmon, as is well known, will attain a size of five or six 
pounds, in the same time. 

One principal reason why natm*alists are indisposed to 
consider the samlets as the young of the salmon, is, that the 
latter are supposed to spawn during the winter months only, 
and I observe considerable reliance is placed on this circum- 
stance (erroneous though it be), in classing these fish as a 
distinct species. That salmon spawn at other times of the 
year, further and more accurate olDservations will prove, and 
to them I have already alluded in the present communication. 
In addition to what I have here brought forward, it is satis- 
factory to me to have had my views confirmed in this resjDect, 
having, since the first part of this paper w^as written, seen 
an extract from an old author and accurate observer (Francks), 
stating that, " being angling one hot sun-shiny day, he took 
umbrage under a tree near the river, from the heat of the sun, 
and there observed two salmon, male and female, in the act 
of depositing their spawn," which he describes very particu- 
larly, and which description coincides with later and more 
accurate observations of the present day ; therefore, it must be 
admitted, that this "hot sun-shiny day" could not have been 
in the winter months. And in Mr. Yarrell's own work, I ob- 
serve it is stated, that in Sweden salmon do spawn in the 
summer ; is it therefore unlikely that they may occasionally 
spawn in the summer in this country, and in other months ? 

In further support of this I will mention, that in the estu- 
aries, or within a short distance in the fi-esh water, the same 
net will occasionally draw out salmon of every size, varying 
from one to four pounds, and upwards ; and if the mesh be 
sufficiently fine, down to the smallest samlet ; which alone 
proves, fi-om their different sizes, that they must have been 
produced at various times of the year. I have myself seen 
salmon of every size, varying from half-a-pound up to ten 
pounds, in each month, from May to December ; yet Mr. 
Yarrell says there is no instance of one in the autumn under 
sixteen or eighteen inches in length ; those who have been 
fishing in the fresh water within a short distance of the tide- 
way of rivers, will bear testimony to what I say, that they 
are numerous at that time, and it needs but little enquiry and 
observation to ascertain this, and even so late as December, 
as I have already noticed in the previous paper. I will just 
remark, that those between half-a-pound and three pounds in 
weight, are called, in different places, salmon-peal, morts, 
salmon-morts, grilse, sewin, and various other names, except 
the right one, which only tends to mystify the subject ; and 
some will even pretend to say they are a distinct species, but 



168 ON THE YOUNG OF THE SALMON. 

any person acquainted with the salmon in their various 
stages, needs no information as to what species they belong. 

It is a common observation amongst anglers, in the months 
of June and July, that there are, at that time, few or no sam- 
lets in the rivers (having, as is supposed, all gone down to 
the sea), and this opinion is formed, because few are then to 
be taken with the rod and line. This may be accounted for 
as follows : — the previous shoals, the produce of the general 
spawning time, having migrated to the sea, leave behind a 
superabundance of food for the lesser number that remain, 
being the produce of a later period of spawning, so that the 
invitation, with hook and line attached, is not taken so rea- 
dily, and the angler can find but little sport, although several 
may even then be occasionally captured. That they are 
then tolerably numerous in the rivers, is proved by the suc- 
cess which I have known to attend the discreditable prac- 
tice of netting with illegal nets at that time. In August and 
September, when there is not that abundance of insect food 
as in the summer months, the hook and line becomes again 
tolerably successful, and from this circumstance it is said, 
though erroneously, that there are a larger quantity of the 
samlets in the rivers, and a name is given them as a distinct 
species. 

If one circumstance more than another tends to prove the 
autumn-samlet to be the young of the salmon, the following 
may be mentioned. In the estuaries of rivers, in the month 
of December, and doubtless, in other months (but I speak 
only from my own observations), these fish may be seen, 
varying in size, from two ounces to a quarter-of-a-pound, 
changing their red spots and trout-like appearance for the 
darker spots and silvery appearance of the salmon, those of 
the larger size having completely acquired their salmon -like 
appearance, and which external change, it is well known, the 
salmon-fry undergo in the salt-water. That this alteration 
in their appearance is caused by coming in contact with a 
different element, joined with a different description of food, 
I think is very probable. The exact time I speak of was 
the 29th of December. Now, I think it must be admitted, 
that seeing these fish in their various stages in the salt water, 
at a time when they are said to be but of one size, and 
spawning in the fresh water, must make an impression on the 
mind of the obsen^er that they are not a distinct species, but 
the young of some other fish, and that fish the salmon. I 
know of no better situations for coming to a right conclusion 
than places of this kind, where they may be seen in all their 
various stages, and I would beg to call upon those who re-

side near the tide-way of rivers, to turn their attention to the 
subject, so that the observations of one person being confirmed 
by others, the public mind will become convinced, and these 
fish preserved, as the young of salmon, from indiscriminate 
destruction. 

I trust I have brought forward sufficient circumstantial 
evidence, to establish the correctness of my belief, that the 
samlets are the young of the salmon ; but as we cannot be 
too cautious in cases of this kind, it is my intention, should 
my health permit, to visit various parts of Scotland, in 
the ensuing summer, where, in the numerous rivers of that 
country, I may possibly pursue the subject further; in that 
event, I shall be happy to communicate the result of my ob- 
servations. In the meantime, I would beg to name it as 
worthy the attention of others, perhaps more capable of judg- 
ing than myself, that, although Natural History is receiving 
a large share of attention in all its branches, yet the history 
of the salmon, in its various stages, appears to me to be very 
imperfectly understood, though one of the most generally 
distributed and valuable of our fishes.

Remarks and Annotations on the Species of Cicindela and FlapJirus men- 
tioned in the above Tables. 

Sp. 2. aptera. This insect, according to M. Brulle, is a Tri- 
condyla of Latreille, and CoUiuris major, Lat. appears to 
be the same insect as Collyris aptera, Fab. In a letter 
lately received from Westermann of Copenhagen this opin- 
ion is incorrect, as he writes Col. major Latr. is quite 
distinct from Col. aptera Fab. He remarks it is certainly 
not apterous, but is a true winged CoUiuris. It is nearly 
as large as longicollis, black, and quite different from all 
the blue species of CoUiuris : vide Westermann in litt. 

Sp. 3. grossa. Now an Apteroessa, Mihi : for an account of 
its characters vide 'Manual,' part ii. page 159, fig. 1. 

Sp. 9. campestris. The true type of Cicindela : the green 
varieties of Cic. purpurea, Olivier, according to Mr. Kirby, 
seem to be the American representatives of the European 
campestris. In Africa, at the Cape of Good Hope, we 



CICINDELA AND ELAPHRUS. 171 

meet with Cic. rotundicollis, which may be regarded as 
representing it on that continent. In a collection of in- 
sects also made by Mr. Strickland in Asia Minor, there ap- 
pears to be two undescribed species which closely resemble 
Cic. campestris, Lin. 

Sp. 11. hybrida. For various observations respecting this spe- 
cies, the reader is referred to Mr. Stephens's ' Illustrations 
of British Entomology,' vide vol. i. page 8, &c. Cicindela 
hirticollis, Say, appears in the New World to represent the 
European hyhrida. 

Sp. 12. purpurea. This insect is subject to vary considera- 
bly ; by inexperienced entomologists some varieties are 
regarded as distinct species. I suggest the adoption of the 
Fabrician name oimarginalis instead of the above, on the 
ground of priority. 

Sp. 15. interrupta. This species belongs to my genus Colo- 
cliroa ; it closely resembles some of the dark varieties of 
C. Chinensis. 

Sp. 16. lunulata. From Dr. Gistl's description I suspect 
that the insect which he has named Cic. Hopei, is only a 
variety of the Fabrician lunulata. 

Sp. 20. catena. Olivier gives the East Indies and the Cape 
of Good Hope as the localities of this species ; in the lat- 
ter continent I am inclined to think it never occurs. The 
specimens purchased at Cape Town, from Verreaux and 
other naturalists, are probably obtained from merchantmen 
trading with India. A few years ago I purchased a collec- 
tion labelled as " Insects of the Caper At first sight I 
was aware that they were peculiar to the East Indies, al- 
though I could not state the exact locality ; on removing 
the paper I discovered a memorandum that they were col- 
lected at Singapore, and afterwards sold to a dealer at the 
Cape : the locality turned out correct. 

Sp. 22. tuberculata. This insect appears to be exceedingly 
rare : it is rarely to be found in modern collections. The 
Banksian cabinet contains almost the only specimen which 
has fallen under my notice. 

Sp. 23. unipunctata. Olivier gives South America as the 
locality for this species ; I am inclined to think it peculiar 
to North America. 

Sp. 25. sexpunctata. This species enjoys a very wide range ; 
it occurs at Bombay, Ceylon, Madras, Calcutta, Singapore 
and Assam : it is subject to considerable variation of mark- 
ings and colour, some of its varieties have been considered 
as distinct. One, which in General Hardwicke's collection 
was named by me Cic. Jlavomaculata, *is only a variety. 
Olivier's figure is execrable. 



172 ON THE SPECIES OF CICINDELA AND ELAPHRUS. 

8p. 26. quadrilineata. This species is exceedingly abun- 
dant. I have seen Indian basket-work ornamented with 
the elytra of this insect ; the effect was good. From the 
account I received from my informant, the Malays and some 
of the races which inhabit Singapore, adorn their handy- 
works with the wings of the above insect. 

Sp. 30. octoc/uttata. I have thought proper to change Oli- 
vier's locality for this insect; he records it as a species from 
South America. Fabricius mentions North America ; Pa- 
lisot Beauvois the Island of St. Domingo ; Schonherr, in 
his ' Synonymia Insectorum,' gives Sierra Leone as its na- 
tive country ; and with the latter authority I am inclined 
to side. 

Sp. 31. trifasciata. This insect must not be confounded 
with our European species, which is evidently distinct. 
The trifasciata of the New World enjoys a very extended 
range, occurring in North and South America as well as in 
several of the West Indian isles. 

Sp. 35. minuta. This species has not fallen under my no- 
tice ; I give it as a Cicindela on the authority of French 
entomologists. 

Sp. 36. emarginata. Now a Drypta according to Fabricius. 
Olivier considered Drypta as a Cicindela ; according to 
modern views the Dryytidad constitute a particular family, 
consisting of several genera. As far as is at present known 
respecting Drypta, it belongs to the Old World. The 
European species are comparatively rare inland ; in Sicily 
and Italy it is abundant under the rejectamenta maris ; in 
England I believe it has only been found on the coast of 
Hastings and Devonshire. In Scotland, some years back, 
I captured it at Leith in a similar situation. Although it 
does not appear to be known in the New World, I think it 
not improbable that it will eventually be found there, oc- 
curring perhaps in North as well as South America. The 
East Indies afford several species ; those from tropical 
Africa are worthy of notice, some in my collection are from 
the banks of the Gambia, and others from Sierra Leone. 

Elaphrvs, Fabricius. 

The genus Elaphrus was by Linnaeus regarded as a Cicin- 
dela, Geoffroy properly considered it as belonging to Carabus 
rather than to the former genus ; he however injudiciously 
applied to the species the name of Buprestis. Fabricius first 
separated them from Carabus, and they now form a family by 
themselves, according to the views of Messrs. Stephens and

Kirby. My friend the Comte de Castelneau arranges with 
them the Lebiadce. Preferring the English authorities, in 
my Manual I have adopted their views. As a group it ap- 
pears (as far as is known at present) to frequent northern 
climes, no instance having occurred of its appearance in 
southern regions. 

Sp. 1. riparius of Linnaeus and Olivier appears to be the self- 
same species, the riparius of Schrank however is El. uli- 
ginosus of Fabricius. 

Sp. 2. paludosus. This is probably only a variety of the 
preceding species. 

Sp. 3. carahoides. This insect is apparently unknown in the 
Parisian collections at present. Schonherr evidently regards 
it as a distinct species. It is singular that the Baron De 
Jean does not mention it in his last Catalogue. 

Sp. 4. littoralis. This species cannot be considered as an 
Elaphrus. The Baron De Jean, in his Catalogue of 1833, 
applies the name of littoralis, Megerle, to another species 
of Elaphrus from Hungary ; it would be better to substi- 
tute that of Megerlei or Dejeanii for the last species, in- 
stead of the name already used by Olivier. 

Sp. 5. aquaticus. Now a Nothiopliilus of Dumeril : for an 
account of our British species I refer to Mr. Waterhouse's 
Monograph in the first volume of the * Entomological Ma- 
gazine,' in which eighteen species are described. 



Art. IV. — Notes on Irish JVatural History, more especially Ferns, 
By Edward Newman, Esq., F.L.S., &c. 

( Continued from page 124:). 

It was a brilliant morning when I took my leave of Sheely, 
and a last lingering look towards those beautiful caverns, 
which, once to have seen, is worth more than the fairest pic- 
ture of imagination. The road towards Cahir is wide and 
straight ; it possesses little to interest the traveller, except 
the joyous faces of the happy people, whom I met by 
crowds on their way to the market at Mitchelstown. The 
poorer Irish appear to me the most easily contented, and the 
most philosophically and truly happy of any peasantry I have 
ever seen; faithful, generous, warm-hearted, fearless, and 
reckless : they smile in peace over a handful of bad potatoes, 
and devoutly thank the Providence who provides it. Oh ! 



174 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

what have politicians to answer for who try to teach these 
people that they are unhappy ! I verily believe that there is 
not a peasant in Tipperary who has not a lighter heart and a 
clearer conscience than half the legislators of St. Stephen's. 
To use the words of Lady Chatterton, " I have come to the 
wise determination of allowing people to be happy in their own 
way ; the more we see of the world the more convinced must 
we be, how totally independent of every outward cause and 
circumstance is happiness : that it springs entirely from the 
mind the Irish are livdng and laughing proofs ^" 

The fine range of Galtees forms the horizon on the left, the 
Knockmildown chain on the right, and as I approached Ca- 
hir, a rich and highly cultivated valley opened before me, 
lying along the base of the Knockmildowns, and stretching 
towards Clonmel. In England you meet with few more cul- 
tivated scenes than this ; it is watered by the Suir, and is 
exceedingly productive. A considerable part of this fine 
tract belongs, as I was told, to Lord Glengall, and is let to 
the actual occupier, at the high rent of 35s. to 40.9. per Irish 
acre : I say actual occupier, because this enormous rent does 
not go into the pocket of the freeholder ; the rent received 
by his lordship being much less. 

Cahir is an interesting little town, situated on the Suir : 
here I observed a well-fruited orchard, and several very good 
gardens, in which I was particularly struck with the beauty 
and luxuriance of some of the plants, more particularly 
hydrangeas, fuchsias, myrtles and laurels; the walls, especially 
of the castle. Lord Glengall's residence, are covered with 
Polypodiuin vulgar e^ occasionally mixed with Asplenium Riita- 
muraria, Asp. Trichomanes and Asp. Adiantum-nigrum. The 
castle is kept in good repair, but is not a remarkably orna- 
mental building. 

I proceeded by Bianconi to Clonmel, through a rich flat- 
tish country, finely wooded, where there were little hills ; 
the land is highly cultivated and very productive. Clonmel 
is pleasantly situated on the Suir, and is surrounded by gen- 
tlemen's seats, in beautifully wooded demesnes. The coun- 
try continues rich and well cultivated to Carrick-on-Suir ; 
the hills continue to be luxuriantly wooded, and the river, 
which runs near the road, is very picturesque ; the stone 
walls are but few, and English- looking hedges tolerably 
abundant. The crops of wheat, oats, and barley, pro- 
mised well. Carrick is an old town, with abundance of spirit 
stores, whence issued a swarm of beggars. Four miles from

NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 175 

Carrick is Pilltown, a most delightful village : nearly all the 
cottages are of the neatest possible description, and half 
hidden by wreaths of clematis, roses, myrtles, and fuchsias. 
The timber is also very fine, the gardens brilliant with flow- 
ers, and the crops of corn in the neighbourhood clean, even, 
and most abundant. I have seen no village in England 
superior in neatness or beauty to Pilltown. I saw a field 
of oats cut, and in sheaves, not a usual mode of husbandry 
in England : the wheat was apparently ready for the sickle. 

From Pilltown to Waterforcl the country is highly cultivat- 
ed, very English looking, and very beautiful ; the hills are 
wooded, and the approach to the city of Waterford, over the 
wooden bridge, is very picturesque. Between Clonmel and 
Waterford I observed the following ferns : — Lomaria spi- 
cant, Pteris aquilina, Polypodium vulgare, Polysticlmm 
aculeatum, Lastrcea Filix-mas, Las. dilatata, Athyrium Fi- 
lix-fcemina, Asplenium Adiantu77i-nigrum,Asp. Trichomanes, 
Asp. lluta-muraria^Scolopendrium vulgar e^Ceterach officina- 
rum, and Osmunda regalis : the last-named species had been 
gradually getting more rare after leaving the boggy districts, 
and was now but seldom seen. 

Waterford is a one-sided place, having its principal street 
(called the quay) situated at the very outside of the town ; 
this quay is fine, nearly a mile in length, and crowded with 
shipping ; the river Suir is here really noble, and capable, 
at high water, of floating ships of any burthen. Almost 
immediately below the town, the Suir is joined by the Bar- 
row, a still more noble and beautiful stream, and in my estima- 
tion, one of the finest rivers in the kingdom. From Wa- 
terford I re-crossed the long wooden bridge, and proceeding 
towards Ross found the country poor, and although generally 
cultivated, producing but meagre crops, and those principally 
potatoes. There was nothing in Ireland struck me as more 
requiring reform than the mode of cultivating potatoes. In 
London, every one expects to see a good potato on bistable, 
as a matter of course. I never recollect seeing at a London- 
er's table, a dish either of half-boiled potatoes, or watery po- 
tatoes, or waxy potatoes, or potatoes full of bruises and sore 
places : such things can be obtained in London, of a certainty, 
but never at the table of a Londoner. (I will just observe, 
par parenthese, that every vegetable is better in London than 
in any part of the United Kingdom.) Now, in Ireland, there 
appears to be no care taken, when setting a crop, that all the 
seed be of one variety. The earliest and latest sorts very 
commonly occur in the same row ; and I have often seen on 
the same dish, some potatoes green and watery, some waxy, 



176 NOTES ON IRISH NATURAL HISTORY. 

and some beautifully floury. The season for each would have 
come round in its turn, but the Irishman knows but one sea- 
son for setting potatoes, and one for getting them in. I re- 
marked that the only criterion by which an Irishman judges 
of the value of his potato crop, is the vigour of the haulm, 
and this every horticulturist in England would consider 
most fallacious ; for it is well known that the portions above 
and below ground often increase or decrease, in an inverse 
ratio. A second fault is the carelessness with which they are 
harvested ; throughout the West and South of Ireland, at the 
inns, you will constantly see halves and fractional parts of po- 
tatoes, which almost everyone rejects, and which are, therefore, 
wasted. At Ross I made many enquiries about the price of 
potatoes, seeing that root was so staple an article of agricul- 
ture. I found the then price was 'Sjd. to 4^d. per stone of 
141bs., that they had been as low as 2j^., and this only a 
short time previously ; but owing to the failure in the west, 
a very considerable export of potatoes from Ross to Clifden, 
Galway, Tralee, &c., had taken place ; and this diminution of 
supply had raised the price : at Tralee, the price of potatoes 
was Q^d., at Galway, 7d., and at Clifden 7^d. per stone, when 
I was at those towns ; this is an unusually high price, and 
does not correspond with the price of labour, Qd. or at most 
Sd. per day. I hope the readers of the * Magazine of Natural 
History ' will not grumble at this dissertation on potatoes : 
if they do, I can make no apology for its introduction ; for 
I conceive a true lover of his race, as a naturalist ought to 
be, cannot consider the welfare of the Irish peasant a sub- 
ject beneath his notice ; and I believe the introduction of a 
dozen good productive varieties of the potato would be a 
blessing to Ireland, far less equivocal, that the political nos- 
trums so frequently proposed. 

At Clonroche, on the road between Ross and Enniscorthy, 
I was struck by the preparations making by the tenants of 
Lord Carew, to give him a public dinner. A tent of enor- 
mous size had been erected, and the expense defrayed by 
rather more than three hundred tenants : I enquired whether 
this was a return for any particular popular act on the part of 
his lordship, but found that it was simply a testimony of re- 
spect and esteem. 

In the journey from Waterford to Enniscorthy I saw none but 
the commoner ferns, Polystichum aculeatum becoming more 
abundant, and Osmunda regalis more rare. Enniscorthy is 
an old and large town, built on the side of a hill, and by every 
approach you enter it through a long line of very humble, 
and not particularly clean cottages ; all the good buildings

being in the centre of the town, and reminding one of Pal- 
myra and the cities of the East, as seen by us through the 
optics of Silk Buckingham, whom, if my memory serve me 
aright, I have heard eulogizing the mode of confining the 
palaces, «&c., to the centre of bustle, dust, and smoke. The 
castle in the middle of the town, now occupied by the Pro- 
testant curate, is a striking building. I mounted the cele- 
brated Vinegar Hill, an eminence close to the town, whence 
an agreeable view of the surrounding country is obtained : 
the hills on every side rise with gentle slopes, and are prettily 
wooded. Vinegar Hill appears to be composed of granite ; 
the summit is bare, with the exception of large patches of 
Sedum Anglicum. The country around Enniscorthy is ge- 
nerally hilly, the land apparently poor, but invariably culti- 
vated, although the crops were very indifferent. Stone walls 
are comparatively rare, and are replaced by furze-hedges ; 
and I not unfrequently observed furze had been sown in the 
interstices of stone walls. These farze-hedges are in many 
places allowed to become wild and straggling ; and not only 
is their appearance in this state very untidy, but their utility, 
as fences, very questionable. Throughout the South of Ire- 
land furze is grown in some abundance, as food for cattle : 
it is cut very frequently, and always while the shoots are young 
and tender ; and is bruised previously to being given them. 
The river Slaney, which runs through the town, is a noble 
and navigable stream. 

Leaving Enniscorthy I passed through Ferns, Gorey, Ark- 
low, and Rathdrum, to Wicklow : there was little for the 
naturalist to observe, except the superabundance of furze 
hedges ; and now, travelling by coach, I was compelled to 
take such roads as coaches could travel, and thus I missed 
the vale of Ovoca, and must trust to hearsay, that 

" There is not in the wide world a valley so sweet, 
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet :" 

for the wooden bridge at Ovoca, and divers minor bridges, 
had been swept away by the flood of the 30th of July, and 
there was no longer any coach-road through '^ the sweet vale 
of Ovoca." The road from Wicklow to Newtown-Mount- 
Kennedy is pretty ; from Newtown-Mount-Kennedy to Bray 
it is fine. This latter passes through the glen of the Downs ; 
steep and beautiful hills are piled up almost perpendicularly 
on each side of you ; and the glen, which pretty much con- 
sists of the demesne of Mrs. Latouche, is completely wooded 
with majestic evergreens ; such Arbutus, Querciis sempervi-

Tens, and laurel, are not to be seen in England ; — the laurels 
are magnificent. 

From Bray to Luggelaw on Lough Tay, is a wild walk 
through some fine Wicklow scenery. Lough Tay is a sweet 
place ; there is such a bold bluff, such a tumultuous multi- 
tude of rocks stretching out into the lake, that 1 gazed on the 
scene with nearly as much delight as on any that the island 
had before afforded. Lough Dan, a few miles further, is beau- 
tiful, exquisitely beautiful, but its beauty is less bold, its 
grandeur is not sublime. I found on the banks of Lough 
Dan, Lomaria spicant, Pteris aquilina, Polypodtum vulgar e^ 
Polystichum aculeatum^ Lastrcea Filix-mas, Las. dilatata, 
Las. Oreopteris, Asplenium Adiantum-nigrumy Aspl. Ruta- 
mmaria, Aspl. Trichomanes^ Scolopendrium vulgare, Os- 
munda regalis, Isoetes lacustris, and Littorella lacustris. 

Near the little village of Roundwood I saw, in a bog, a 
profusion of Plnguicula Lusitanica^ Malaxis paludosa, and 
Narthecimn ossifragiim ; the latter plant, and Anagallis te- 
nella, are most abundant on nearly all the Irish bogs. From 
Roundwood, I bent my course to the Seven Churches of 
Glendalough, a place which, if one might enjoy it alone, is 
well worthy of an hour's contemplation ; but alas ! it is so 
infested with guides, that one is driven half wild with the 
clamour. I here had two companions, and I think about 
forty guides followed us with unremitting assiduity ; at last 
we escaped them and looked back on the stately round tower 
of Glendalough, fringed at half its height with a belt of Pa- 
rietaria : on the walls of the churches and ruins I observed 
the three more common species of Asplenium, Scolopendrium 
vulgare, and Ceterach officinarum^ and one roof was half co- 
vered with Mentha rotundifolia. In the lake we found Lo- 
belia Dortmanna, Littorella lacustris, and Lsoetes lacustris ; 
then, turning away from its margin, we made for the wa- 
terfall ; and here, as I was scrambling over the slippery 
rocks in search of Hymenophyllum, I lost my footing, and 
fell plump into the stream ; but luckily, making the descent 
legs first, I kept myself upright, and affectionately embracing 
a projecting rock, I maintained my position in spite of the 
power of the river, and joined heartily in the laugh of one 
of my companions. This district is full of ferns and mosses ; 
Las, Oreopteris, generally so rare in Ireland, here occurs in 
boundless profusion ; and the varieties of Las. dilaiata, whe- 
ther flat, convex, or concave, seem absolutely endless : from 
every crevice in the rocky hills which surround that pic- 
turesque lake, this fern may be seen waving its blight green 
fronds. Here and there, as we proceeded, a huge mass of 



FOSSIL PLANTS OF BRITAIN. 179 

Polypodiiijn viilgare, perhaps the growth of centuries, was 
sending forth its thousand fronds ; but everywhere, heath, and 
fern, and moss, and rock, and trickling streams of water, were 
so mingled with the forestry moored in the crevices, that it 
was a scene goodly to look on and delightful to scramble over. 
Afterwards the hill became bare, and a little track of steps 
worn or cut in the rocks, showed that human beings went 
further down towards the water. It was very steep, but we 
descended in single file ; presently our leader disappeared ; 
he had entered that strange cavity in the rock called St. 
Kevin's bed ; I followed, and our companion followed me. 
It is a strange excavation, and its romantic situation, the 
difficulty of access to it, and the little probability of a visit, 
point it out as a likely residence for such an ascetic as St. 
Kevin. We read the autographs of Scott, Moore, and other 
wise men who had ventured into this strange place, and had 
written their names against the wall ; and there we sat, hud- 
dled together, gazing out upon 

" That lake whose gloomy shore, 
Skylark never warbled o'er :" 

and so end my Notes on the Natural Histoiy of Ireland.

184 ON A NEW GENUS OF FISHES FROM INDIA. 



Art. VI. — On a new Genus of Fishes from India. By William 
Thompson, Esq., Vice Pres. Natural History Society of Belfast. 

In the course of last spring my friend Dr. Cantor, favourably 
known to naturalists by his zoological investigations in India, 
communicated a description and drawing of a new genus of 
fishes for publication in this Magazine. From the drawing 
a wood-cut was executed ; but in the mean time the descrip- 
tion was unfortunately mislaid. When I last saw Dr. Cantor 
in London, in the month of .Tune, he was soon to re-embark 
for India; and having some time before given me a specimen' 
of the fish in question, he urged me to draw up an account of 
it. Considering it better that the discoverer should also be 
the describer, I delayed, still in the hope that the missing 
MS. might be discovered, but I am now informed that every 
search has in vain been made for it. 




Bregmaceros McCleUandii, Cantor, MS. 

To the ichthyologist this fish must, in every respect, be 
highly interesting. It is from the brackish water of the Gan- 
getic Delta, and ranks under the family Gadidm, which chiefly 
inhabit the waters of the temperate and colder regions of the 
globe. In generic form it is quite anomalous, the filament 
springing from the upper part of the head — whence the name 
Bregmaceros — giving to the species an unique appearance, 
whilst the greatly elongated ventrals at once bring to mind 
the genus Phycis (this being the only generic resemblance) ; 
but instead of the ventrals consisting each of a single ray, as 
in Phycis, we find these organs as numerous as in any genus 

1 Only two were obtained ; the other was, I believe, sent to the Radcliffe 
Library, Oxford, along with the specimens and drawings illustrative of Dr. 
Cantor's ' Spicilegium Serpentium Indicorum,' (published in the Zoologi- 
cal Proceedings, 1839).

throughout the family, unless Brotula (the number of whose 
ventral rays I have not seen mentioned) should prove to be 
an exception. It may be thus characterised. 

Genus, Bregmaceros. Cantor, MS. 

Body elongated : two dorsals ; one anal ; ventrals very long, consisting 
of several rays: chin without barhule: a filament projecting from the top 
of the head. 

Species, Bregmaceros McClellandi. Cantor, MS. ' 

Head small ; frontal filament equal to one fourth the length of body ; 
ventrals equal to half its length ; first dorsal high, subtriangular; second 
very long, low and equal anteriorly, then moderately high ; anal resem- 
bling three fins joined, the first portion high and subtriangular, the second 
low and equal, the third of moderate height; dorsal and anal correspond- 
ing to each other throughout ; caudal forked. 

Description. — Length 3 inches, depth J an inch, thick- 
ness \ of an inch. Dorsal profile somewhat arched to first 
D. fin, thence decreasing very gradually to the tail ; ventral 
convex to the vent, thence corresponding w^ith the dorsal out- 
line. Head small, occupying one sixth of the entire length ; 
snout truncated ; lower jaw barely exceeding the upper ; teeth 
numerous along the margin of both jaws, those in the up- 
per very small and uniform, those in the lower varying in 
size, and some considerably larger than those in the upper, 
all pointed and hooked inwards ; similar teeth in front of vo- 
mer : tongue large and fleshy : eye Inline in diameter, placed 
at this distance from the snout ; a similar space intervening 
between the eyes ; that between them and posterior line of 
opercle equal to twice their diameter ; protected in front by a 
slightly- elevated bony process, within which, and near to the 
upper margin of the eyes, are situated the nostrils, which are 
simple apertures ; operculum rounded ; rays of branchioste- 
gous membrane — .? ^ filamentous or unarticulated appendage 
originating 4 lines from base of snout, 9 lines in length, very 
delicate ; from its base to first D. is a deep chan- 
nel, with slightly-elevated Trigla-Wke scales on 



m 
either side, but smooth-margined. Scales of mod- K^ 
erate size, somewhat rounded at their free margins, ^ ^mM 
delicately sculptured, ^ twelve in an oblique row from vent 
to dorsal profile ; lateral line unmarked by colour and hardly 

^ The name was the only MS. left with me on the subject. The species 
was named by Dr. Cantor in honour of his friend, J. McClelland, Esq., 
whose researches in the Zoology and Geology of India are well known. 

2 Seven are given as a family character: in this instance I could not be 
satisfied of the number, four only being reckoned with certainty. Repeti- 
tions of some of the family characters appear in the description, as I did 
not consider them misplaced in a genus entirely new.

distinguishable, taking the form of dorsal profile, at first 
nearer to the dorsal than ventral outline, then midway be- 
tween them : vent 11 lines from extremity of lower jaw. 

Fins. — Ventrals originate 3^^ lines from last-named point, 
have six or seven rays, the three or four inner ones of ordina- 
ry size and bifurcated, the three outer unbranched, greatly 
prolonged, and of singular structure, the first 13, the second 
and third 18 lines in length ; they are beautifully and conspi- 
cuously articulated, the articulations increasing in length to- 
wards the filamentous termination ; these rays are very broad 
towards the base, and are winged or margined on either side 
by a beautifully transparent process, in form calling to mind 
the dorsal lamina of the cephalopodous genus Loligo: pec- 
torals elongate triangular, placed high, originating 5j lines 
from snout, 5|- lines long, first ray shorter than the succeed- 
ing nineteen, the shorter bifurcated, the longer unbranched, 
protected by scales at the base : Jirst dorsal broadly triangu- 
lar, originating about 12 lines from snout, base occupying 7 
lines, longest ray equal in length to the greatest depth of bo- 
dy, nineteen unbranched rays; second dorsal originating close 
behind the first, extending for 15 lines, to the base of caudal, 
low and of uniform height at first, then becoming of moderate 
elevation, thirty- six ? unbranched rays ; anal originating 11^ 
lines from point of lower jaw and extending to base of cau- 
dal, occupying 21 lines, about the first third broadly triangu- 
lar and very prominent, its longest ray 7 lines, next third low, 
short and equal, last third rather more than moderately deve- 
loped, longest ray of this portion 3 lines, sixty unbranched 
rays in all, protected by scales at the base ; caudal small, 
forked, 4 lines long, occupying one ninth of the entire length, 
rays 12-5-, the longest doubly bifurcated. 

Colour (in spirits) of a yellowish sandy hue along the back 
and upper portion of sides, varied with minute black spots, 
rather more than the lower half silvery, head of this colour ; 
upper portion of pectorals and of both dorsals black, remain- 
der hyaline ; caudal fin black ; ventrals and anal hyaline, ex- 
cept a slight dusky tinge towards the extremity of the latter 
fin. 

This genus is so anomalous as to render quite unnecessary 
a comparison between it and any other of the Gadidce, 

Belfast, Feb. 1840. 



[In a note accompanying Mr. Thompson's communication on this highly 
interesting genus, he observes, — " To render the communication the more

perfect, you should, if possible, have the following alterations made in the 
engraving : — two shorter rays should be added to the first D. tin, and the 
second D. entirely altered ; this and the anal should be made to touch upon 
the base of C. fin ; the whole body should be scaled over ; the frontal spine 
too should originate in a line with the posterior margin of the eye. These 
alterations made, the figure would be about perfect." 

The engraving being on wood, unfortunately does not allow of the in- 
troduction of the proposed corrections; but the characters of the genus are 
so strongly marked, that no material ambiguity can result from the error 
on the part of the artist. — Ed.] 



Art. VII. — 071 the occurrence of Mammalian Remains in the 
Lower Eocene deposits of Epernay, Marne. By Jos. Prest- 
wiCH, Jan., Esq., F.G.S. &c. 

In a paper read before the Geological Society of Paris, De- 
cember, 1837,' I gave a short account of some peculiar or- 
ganic remains, which I had found in a coarse arenaceous 
stratum of the plastic clay series, forming the summit of 
Mont Bernon, near Epernay. 

As I have since added to the list of fossils which I then 
was able to enumerate, you may, perhaps, think the substance 
of the communication, along with a reference to a memoir 
upon a nearly equivalent deposit in the neighbourhood of 
Paris, by M. Chas. D'Orbigny, of sufficient interest for inser- 
tion in your journal. 

Epernay is situated upon the eastern margin of the basin 
of Paris. The tertiary strata merely cap the hills, the bases 
of which, with the valleys, consist of chalk. The small 
streams flowing off from the high table land, frequently ex- 
pose, in their course down the steep declivities, excellent 
sections of the several deposits. 

Numerous small sections are also made in excavating the 
bitumino-carbonaceous clays (cendres), common in the plastic 
clay of this country, and used as manure for the vines. Se- 
veral pits of this nature are worked on Mont Bemon, afford- 
ing good opportunities of studying its structure ; but the 
superposition of the beds is in some places rendered rather 
obscure by numerous small faults, which range about 10° E. 
of S., and 10° W. of N. Connecting, however, the various 
sections, the following is, as well as I could ascertain, the 
order of superposition, commencing from the summit.

MAMMALIAN REMAINS AT EPERNAY. 189 

this fluviatile deposit, which is so fi-equently interpolated in 
the lower eocene of England and France ; but the remark- 
able fact connected with this locality, is the occurrence of 
the remains of several terrestrial Mammalia, associated with 
those of reptiles, fishes, and shells. They are confined to 
the lower part of the stratum of coarse sand, No. 5^ of the 
foregoing section, and are very scarce; whilst remains of 
Testacea and bones of the Trionyx and Emys are far from 
uncommon. The sand of that part of the bed in which they 
are imbedded is coarser than other parts of the stratum, and 
contains occasional pebbles of quartz. It varies rapidly in 
thickness, from 10 to 20 feet, and the organic remains are 
limited to a very small vertical range.* For the determina-

This deposit presents a striking analogy with that described 
by M. Chas. D'Orbigny, at Meudon. In both places, the 
strata containing these terrestrial reliquicB, have evidently 
been produced by a river action more violent than that which 
has accumulated the accompanying strata. At the same 
time their superposition is not precisely the same, as may be 
seen by the following section given by M. Chas. D'Orbigny, 
of the Hill of Meudon.

» Mr. Owen has lately described to the Geological Society the remains 
of a mammal, somewhat allied to the Chceropotamus and Peccari, found 
by Mr. Richardson in the lower part of the London clay, at Heme Bay, 
which would thus bring it to about the same age as theEpernay specimen. 
He likewise gave an account of a series of vertebra from the London clay 
of the Isle of Sheppey, in the fine collection of Mr. Bowerbank, which he 
considered to belong to a large serpent, and has named it Palceophis 
tolypeutes.

of a marine calcareous stratum between the plastic clay and 
the chalk of Meudon, to which a careful examination now 
enables me [C. D'Orbigny], to add several new details." (See 
section, p. 190), 

This calcaire grossier is whitish or yellowish, and gene- 
rally slightly coherent, frequently encloses numerous frag-

many places by the presence of numerous pisolitic grains.

" It will be perceived that the fossils of this deposit are 
tertiary, and that not one is common to the underlying chalk, 
with which it appears some French geologists had classified 
it." M. D'Orbigny, who designates this deposit under the 
name of Calcaire pisolitique tertiaire, then mentions several 
localities in which it occurs, in the vicinity of Paris, as at 
Bougival, Port Marley, Vigny, and Auteuil. He also consi- 
ders the shelly beds of calcaire grossier of Laversine, near 
Beauvais, as the equivalent of the same stratum. 

A pit recently excavated at Montalets, Bas Meudon, led 
M. Chas. D'Orbigny to discover a series of new and interest- 
ing strata immediately overlying the above-mentioned cal- 
caire pisolitique (see section, p. 190), and irom the chalky 
conglomerate No. 6, he obtained the following reliquice : —

" Above the conglomerate is a series of beds of plastic 
clay, slightly calcareous, and frequently arenaceous, with 
crystals of selenite, gypsum, and numerous traces of vege- 
tables which sometimes form an irregular seam of lignite." 
"Associated with the terrestial debris are fresh -water Testacea, 
of the genera Anodonta and Paludina, often cast in iron 
pyrites, and much compressed." Stratum No. 2, is consi- 
dered to represent the ordinary deposit of argile plastique 
of Paris, over which lies the thick deposit oicalcaire grossier 
proper. 

In conclusion, M. D'Orbigny considers, 

Istly, " That the genus Hamites existed until the end of 
the cretaceous epoch, and that the chalk of the Paris Basin 
contains turtles of a large size. 

2dly, " That the plastic clay of the neighbourhood of 
Paris is indisputably separated from the chalk by a distinct 
group, which may be named Calcaire pisoliiique tertiah'e, 
and which, from the nature of its organic remains, belongs 
evidently to the palseotherian and tertiary, and not to the 
cretaceous period. 

3dly, " That there evidently existed, during the accumu- 
lation of the lower part of the plastic clay, several genera of 
Mammalia, differing considerably from those discovered in 
the upper series of the Paris Basin." 

Whilst, however, this fluviatile deposit is, in the neighbour- 
hood of Paris, distinctly proved to be interpolated between 
two well characterized portions of the calcaire grossier, it 
can, in Champagne, only be considered as synchronous with 
the lower part of the eocene series. At Damery, the plastic

clay with its characteristic fossils, may be seen underlying 
the calcaire grossier, but its position with regard to the sac- 
charine fossiliferous limestone of Mont Aime and Vertu * 
(imagined to be the equivalent of the calcaire pisolitiqiie), 
is yet uncertain, although the latter reposes, in some places, 
immediately upon the chalk, and in others, is only separated 
from it by a few feet of clay, containing remains exclusively 
marine. At neither ofthese localities,however, where this lime- 
stone varies in thickness from 60 to 100 feet, is it overlaid by 
strata sufficiently well characterized to establish its superpo- 
sition ; neither do the organic reliqui(B afford us much informa- 
tion, for the species of none of the Testacea have yet been 
recognized, in consequence of their almost invariably occur- 
ring in the state of casts : as a group, however, this deposit 
appears to exhibit a close analogy to those of the calcaire pi- 
solitique of the neighbourhood of Paris. Still I obtained 
from this locality, a few very perfect specimens of the teeth 
and bones of reptiles and saurians ; also some palates and 
teeth of Squalns and other fishes.

FLUVIO-MARINE DEPOSIT ON THE ESSEX COAST. 197 

Art. IX. — J^otice of a Fluvio-marine Deposit containing Mam- 
malian Remains, occurring in the Parish of little Clacton, on 
the Essex coast. By John Brown, Esq., F.G.S. 

Several lacustrine formations have from time to time been 
recorded in this Magazine, as occurring in this or the adjoin- 
ing counties, but their general character has been that of 
purely fresh -water deposits. 

The one I now wish to bring under notice, is on the east- 
ern coast of Essex, ten miles south of Walton, and has abun- 
dance of marine shells, mixed with those of fresh-water. 
The beds of shells, alternate with thick deposits of peaty 
matter in the cliffs, to the depth of 18 or 20 feet, as shown 
in the accompanying section, which was taken on the spot ; 
and at the same time, the shells, fossil wood, seeds of Chara, 
and Cypris^ were collected, which I now forward you with this 
paper. The hollow or basin occupied by this deposit, mea- 
sures about 600 yards in a north and south direction ; and at 
low water, it can be traced for about 80 yards eastward from 
the face of the cliffs ; and it doubtless extends much farther 
under the sea, as the fresh-water shells, and bones of the fos- 
sil Mammalia, are seen lying in their lacustrine beds, close 
up to low- water mark ; and we may feel assured, that if this 
coast continues to be visited with the same destructive ele- 
ments to which it has been exposed for the last forty years, 
unless these lacustrine beds are continued for a considerable 
distance under the surface of the land to the westward from 
the present line of cliffs, there will be nothing to indicate to 
future geologists, that a fresh-water lake ever existed here ; 
but that this fluvio-marine deposit, which now presents 
so many features of interest from the great number and 
the character of its organic remains, will, like the beds of 
crag once seen at Harwich, be swept away by the sea, before 
many centuries have passed over. 

Geological writings are the only evidence which will trans- 
mit to posterity that the shelly beds of the crag once existed 
on the cliffs at Harwich ; and this consideration makes it de- 
sirable that as great an amount of facts as can now be col- 
lected, should be published in scientific works open to such 
observations. 

The finding of fossil fresh-water shells in certain places, is 
not always indicative of a lake having existed in such spots ; 
the shells may have been drifted down a river into an estua- 
ry, and by that means become mingled with those of the sea. 
But in the instance under review, I can adduce not only the 
fresh-water and land shells, as well as nuts, seeds, and whole 



198 FLUVIO-MARINE DEPOSIT ON THE COAST OF ESSEX. 

trees, but the successive accumulations of peaty matter, and 
their various thicknesses, which are seen alternating with 
layers of marine and fresh-water shells, mingled together in 
the same bed, as shown in the section, (fig. 9). 

Moreover, this thick mass of peat affords us sufficient evi- 
dence that the marine shells were introduced to the different 
beds by various irruptions of the sea into this fresh-water 
lake, while the beds of peat were there forming. And it is 
worth remarking, at the same time, that there does not ap- 
pear to be any admixture of marine fossil shells in the lower 
stratum (No. 7.) of the section, in which such a great number 
of bones oi Mmnmalia have been found associated with P«/w- 
dina^ Valvata, Lymnea, Planorbis, Ancylus, Helix, Vertigo, 
Clausilia, Unio, Cyclas, Cypris, and seeds of Chara ; the 
last being very numerous. 

The lowest stratum appears to have been formed under dif- 
ferent conditions to those which prevailed when the beds of 
mixed shells above it were deposited. 

The fluviatile shells of the upper beds were doubtless de- 
rived from this lowest stratum, as the fluviatile species of the 
upper beds occur in great abundance in the lowest, namely. 
No. 1 of the section. But at the same time there are mol- 
luscous genera in the lowest stratum, which have not been 
met with in the newer beds : for instance, the Unio, which 
occurs in great plenty in the lowest bed, has not been found 
in the upper beds. 

If this is the same species of Unio as that which is found 
fossil at Grays, and is figured at page 548, vol. ii. n. s. of 
this Magazine, according to the description there given, it 
does not appear either to be common as a fossil, or to be 
known as a recent British species. 

Geologists have termed these fossil mammalian remains, di- 
luvial, from the circumstance of their being very frequently 
found in gravel ; but oftentimes their high state of preserva- 
tion is opposed to the idea of their being drifted from any 
great distance, in company with the rough and hard mate- 
rials of which gravel is generally composed. And from what 
I have observed of the bones of the larger Mammalia which 
were deposited in the lower bed of this formation, the good 
condition of these and of all the fossil bones that have hitherto 
been found along this coast, leads me to infer that their histo- 
ry is more closely connected with the fresh-water beds, than 
with the gravel. 

I have had opportunities of observing the relation between 
fossil Mammalia, and the lacustrine beds in which they were 
found, at other places as well as on this coast, viz. at Stutton,

bones have been found in the midst of the fresh-water strata, 
and cut oif from the upper and superincumbent strata of 
sand and gravel, by intervening beds of shells, peat, and 
sand. 

Of the bones of fossil Mammalia, which have been found 
at Walton in such quantities, some of them have been de- 
tected with fluviatile shells adhering to them, although there 
is not that decided lacustrine character in the strata at Wal- 
ton which we find in other localities on this line of cliffs. 

According to the description given in this Magazine, for 
1838, of the fossil Mammalia found in the deposit at Grays, 
there is strong evidence for presuming that a closer relation 
existed between those remains and the fresh-water beds of 
that locality, than between the remains and the sand and 
gravel which are superimposed to them. We hear of no fos- 
sil bones being found in the latter ; but at the same time, I 
will readily admit that this class of fossils has been frequently 
found in gravel, without exhibiting any decided marks of a 
fresh-water derivation, and it is not always very easy to ac- 
count for the anomaly of finding these remains so perfect in 
condition, considering that they had been found in beds of 
rolled flints and other hard substances, which have, at the

this Magazine, would lead us to infer that it has not been 
subject to the violent removal which attends the drifting of 
gravel ; but that rather, as the accompanying remarks state, 
has been disengaged from its former deposit, by the sea- 
wasting of the land, in the same manner as that element is 
now laying bare the same kind of fossil bones embedded in 
fluviatile strata along our eastern coast. 

Elephant. — Among'st many fragments of tuslis, one specimen 4 feet long, 
in good preservation, and another, 7 inches in diameter. Numerous 
grinders, several very perfect, and of full size. A large mass of the 
lower jaw, including the symphysis. 
Vertebra, 8 inches diameter, perfect. 
Large femur, scapula, and corresponding condyle. 

Rhinoceros. — Os frontis ; three distinct lower jaws with molar teeth re- 
maining. 
VertebrcB and detached teeth. A radius. 

Deer. — Horns with both round and flat antlers; also branched and 
broadly palmated : teeth, vertebra and bones of the legs, and various 
other parts of the skeleton. 

Bos Urus. — VertebrcB and other parts of the skeleton. 
Horns. See ' Mag. Nat. Hist.,' Vol. i. p. 160. 

A horn broken off at the smaller end, to 4 inches diameter; it is still 
3 feet long, and measures 20 inches in circumference at the larger end. 
This specimen was at least 4 feet 4 inches long when whole, and when 
sheathed in its original covering must have measured the enonnous 
length of five feet on the exterior curve.

Whilst the great mass of the layers No. 5 and 6, is composed of marine 
shells, (we state this solely from the contents of the box, and not from our 
own examination of the beds themselves, since our visit only occupied

nal. The first bed there noticed, in a table given of these strata, is thus 
referred to . — " Superficial gravel, containing bones of land animals, pro- 
bably ivashed out of stratified deposits." As we know that Mr. Brown has 
lately been paying great attention to the gravel and fresh-water beds of

of this island. We have in preparation some remarks upon the Geological 
features of the line of coast extending from Southend to Harwich, in the

Sir, 

As you have published in a former volume of 
your Magazine, a letter addressed to me by my brother, Mr. 
George Thompson, of Cape Town, accompanying a meteor- 
olite, of the fall of which he was an eye-witness, the follow- 
ing further particulars relating to this occuiTgnce, may be 
thought by you of sufficient interest to lay before the public. 
They are taken from a letter sent by Mr. Maclear, of the 
Royal Observatory, Cape Town, to the ' South African Com- 
mercial Advertiser,' of December 11, 1839. 
I remain, Sir, 

Your's &c., 

ROBERT THOMPSON. 

Editor 'Mag. Nat. Hist.' 

" The first account of the Meteor was brought to Cape Town by the 
Hon. Judge Menzies and Mr. George Thompson, who were travelling 
together from the Frontier. I called upon these gentlemen, and ob- 
tained afterwards a written statement from them, by which it appears 
the Judge's cavalcade was out-spanned on the Blood River on the 
morning of the 13th of October; (this River falls into the Gouritz 
River). The spot is sixteen hours, or about 90 miles, at their rate of 
travelling, eastward of the Cold Bokkeveld. Mr. Thompson states, 
"At about nine o'clock on the morning of the 13th of October, the 
meteor appeared, to the best of my judgment, to approach from the 
west, with great velocity, and precisely similar to a Congreve rocket

of laige dimensions, — the phenomenon expanded nearly over-head, 
and a])parently not more than 300 or 400 feet high, dispersing in 
large globes, the size of 421b. shot, of quicksilvery ap])earance ; then 
fell for a few seconds toward the earth, and vanished." Neither Mr. 
Menzies nor Mr. Thompson heard any noise. On reaching the Bok- 
keveld, they ascertained that the meteor had fallen there about the 
time they witnessed the phenomenon above described. 

Extract of a letter from the Rev. Mr. Zahn, of Tnlbagh, addressed 
to F. Watermeyer, Esq., and dated 6th November, 183^: — 

"The object of these lines is to fulfil my promise of sending to you herewith one of the stones, 
which fell simultaneously during the atmospheric tremor in the Cold Bokkeveld, on the l^th of 
October. This stone-was found between the estates of Jacobus Jooste and Pet. du Toit. Several 
have fallen on the place of Rudolph van Heerden, where one fell on the hard road, and was 
smashed to pieces. Another on a ploughed field, sunk a few inches into the ground ; and a tliird, 
falling on a moist place near the water, lodged itself to the depth of several feet. Some people 
say they observed smoke whilst the stones fell; and also, when they were picked up a smell was 
observable, between sulphur and gunpowder. 

" The stone which you receive lay an hour distance from the place where others were found, 
in the same direction in which the agitation was perceptible, viz., from N. W. to S. E., more 
stones were found. Some people saw in the same dii-ection also, a dark blue streak, which lost 
itself in a soutli-easterly direction. 

" 1 have another, somewhat larger stone in the Bokkeveld, which was too heavy for me to 
carry on horseback. If the latter can be of service to you, I shall not fail to send it. The 
present stone was found in two pieces, as it is at present." 

This specimen sent by Mr. Zahn, Mr. Watermeyer was so kind as 
to place in my hands for Sir John Herschel, and is the same which 
was analysed by Mr. Faraday. It was found by P. du Toit, between 
his habitation and Jacob Jooste 's. It weighed 27 ounces, troy. The 
other was afterwards forwarded by me to Sir J. Herschel, by pennis- 
sion of Mr. Watenneyer. It weighed about 4 lbs. 2 oz., avoirdupois, 
and is the same, I believe, that fell in the moist ground, close to R. van 
Heerden 's house. I suspect its destination will be the British Museum. 

When Dr. Trnter, the civil commissioner of Worcester visited Cape 
Town, in November, 1838, I called upon him. He told me he was 
sitting in his office on the before-mentioned morning, when the win- 
dows suddenly shook in such a way, that he apprehended the shock of 
an earthquake. He examined his barometer, and found the mercury 
depressed to the lowest point of its range throughout the year. He 
likewise mentioned the leading occurrences related in Mr. Zahn's letter. 
Dr. Truter afterwards was so kind as to send me a map of the Bokke- 
veld, whereon the path of the Meteor was laid down, together with the 
affidavit of Kieviet, reported in your Journal of the 27th, also several 
specimens of the Meteorolite, including the one recognised by Kieviet. 
These have been forwarded to the Admiralty, together with two inte- 
resting letters from the Doctor ; copies of which, I am sorry to say, I 
did not retain. 

I will now proceed to describe the result of my visit to the Bokke- 
veld, accompanied by Mr. Watenneyer, Lieut. Jacob, of the Indian 
Service, and Mr. Bailey, of the H.E.I.C. Civil Service. 

It may be proper to state that the Cold Bokkeveld is an irregular 
valley or basin, bounded by high rugged mountains, which is the 
character of the basins enclosing the towns of Worcester and Tul- 
bagh. Within the valley of the Bokkeveld the ground undulates. 



SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE. 203 

and in some parts is considerably elevated, so as to partially screen 
the fann-houses from each other. The Schurfde Berg forms the west 
boundary. About a mile from its base, towards the north, is the 
farm-house of Rudolph van Heerden. The house of Bareiid Jooste 
is about 6 miles from the latter in a north-easterly direction. The 
house of Jacob Jooste is some miles further east, and the habitation of 
Pieter du Toit seems to be about 15 miles S. E. of van Heerden's, so 
that Jooste 's is north of a right line joining the latter. It is unneces- 
sary to give separately the minute details of the examination of these 
people with reference to the general character of the phenomenon, for 
they all agree in their description of it. Their attention was first ex- 
cited by a violent explosion^ followed by a rumbling noise, like that 
from heavy waggons passing over stony ground. On looking up they 
saw a blue stream of smoke, as if from fired gunpowder, passing over 
from S. W. to N. E., viz., from the Schurfde Berg range, at a point 
a little north of Van Heerden's, towards Pieter du Toit's At the in- 
stant, the son of Van Heerden was standing between his house and the 
Schurfde Berg, where he saw something fall, which he picked up. 
The sky was cloudless, and no wind. His mother ran out of the 
house, and observed another plunge into the swamp N. E. of the house, 
where it sunk to some depth, from whence it was aftei'wards removed. 
These positions are separated by about a mile, and were shown to us 
by Mrs. Van Heerden. 2dly. Barend Jooste, with two servants, was 
near the mountain south of his house at the moment of explosion. He 
saw something descend to the ground, and where it struck, the grass 
smoked. The meridian of this spot was shown to us by B. Jooste in 
person, and the specimen is that sworn to by Kieviet in his affidavit. 
3dly. A servant of Pieter du Toit's was standing near his master's 
house. He saw something fall to the ground about a mile below the 
garden, in the brushwood, which he ran towards and brought to his 
master. The spot was shown to us by the servant. I did not enquire 
to whom the specimen was given. Each of these persons assert, that 
on approaching the meteorolites, they were so hot that they could not 
be taken up in the hand ; also, that the sky was cloudless and calm. 

I have thus enumerated all that ivas seen falling at the moment of 
explosion. But the curiosity of the people being excited, further 
search was made. A mass was discovered on the road, N. E. of Van 
Heerden's house, in fragments, broken apparently by striking the hard 
ground. Barend Jooste found a lump which separated into fragments 
on taking it up, owing, he thinks, to moisture before it was found. 
He had parted with some of it; the remainder, weighing four pounds 
less by half an ounce, he gave to us. Pieter du Toit found a quantity 
in fragments on the road near his house ; and farther on towards Jacob 
Jooste 's another, (the specimen first sent to Sir J.. Herschel), and his 
son found a third in the brushwood, N. E. of the house. The points 
at Du Toit's, where these several specimens were discovered, are about 
a mile from each other. If a zone of one mile in breadth and 16 
miles long, is conceived to extend from the Schurfde Berg, near Van 
Heerden's, to Pieter du Toit's, I believe all the points where the mete- 
orolites fell will be found to lie within it. A small portion of this 



204 SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE. 

giouiid is cultivated — the remainder is covered vvitli brushwood Hke 
that over waste land. 

It appears that six persons only chanced to be in this tract at the 
time — two of them within a mile of each other — three close together, 
but about six miles from the latter — and one at Du Toit's, eight miles 
farther on. Beyond Du Toit's the line of direction is over rugged 
mountains for a considerable distance, and, 1 believe, uninhabited. — 
Hence I conceive I am waiTanted in supposing that but a small 
proportion of the original mass has been found ; but enough for the 
purpose of analysis and future comparison ; altogether about 20 lbs. 
avoirdupois, according to the following list :

The violence of the explosion of this meteor may be surmised from 
the fact, that it was heard at the distance of 50 miles from the Bokke- 
veld. At Worcester two reports were heard in succession, but 1 ap- 
prehend the second was the echo of the first, since no person in the 
Bokkeveld heard two explosions, and the lay of the mountains was 
likely to produce several echoes. The optical deception of the ball 
appearing to separate nearly over-head where Mr. Menzies and Mr. 
Thompson stood, is a proof that it was much elevated at the instant. 

I have only to add, that as the material specimens of meteors do 
not possess any intrinsic value, beyond the extension of natural know- 
ledge, they should be forwarded to natural depositories or scientific in- 
stitutions, and not retained as mere objects of curiosity, or in the less 
informed circles of delusion. I saw last week a fine specimen in the 
hands of a fanner in the country, which was picked up by a Hotten- 
tot (belonging to his grandfather) near the Great River, who saw it 
fall. It must have been in their possession about 60 years. This 
man had refused 50 dollars for it, as a captain of a ship said it would 
secure the possessor against the eflbcts of a ihunder-storm 1"

Mr. Editor, 

I HAVE been so frequently applied to by 
geologists, as to the best mode of procuring the fossils of the London 
clay from the Isle of Sheppey, that I am induced to send you a few 
hints as to the mode of collecting in that locality. Although one 
of the most accessible, it is probably the least known of any of the 
rich geological fields that are within a short distance of the metropolis. 
As a trip to this interesting spot can be accomplished by an absence 
from London of only three days, and yet the collector be amply laden 
with fossils on his return, I will endeavour to put your readers in posses- 
sion of the best mode of conducting such an excursion. The best con- 
veyance is by the Southend and Sheemess steam-packets, which leave 
London Bridge on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, at 1 1 o'clock 
in the morning, and reach Sheerness about 4 or 5 o'clock in the after- 
noon. The town is divided into two parts, — the one contained within 
the hmits of the ganison being designated the Blue-town, while that 
beyond the fortifications to the north-east is designated the Mile-town ; 
— and it is to this portion that I should recommend the visitor to pro- 
ceed, and to take up his quarters either at the Royal Hotel, or at the 
Wellington : the latter is an exceedingly snug and comfortable house, 
and is the one which I have resorted to for many years. After having 
established yourself in your inn, request the Boots to desire the atten- 
dance of Mr. Hays, (better known perhaps by the name of Paddy 
Hays), from whom you may purchase, at a very reasonable rate, some 
good fossils, such as crabs, lobsters, heads and portions of fishes, and 
numerous species of fossil fruits. Our traveller will then have accom- 
plished all that can be done towards the acquisition of fossils until the 
following morning ; there not being, I believe, any other collector in 
the town from whom purchases can be made. 

On the following morning I should recommend an early breakfast, 
as a considerable extent of ground is to be traversed. It is advisable 
to go provided with five or six sheets of soft paper, to wrap fragile 
specimens in, and a few cotton or linen bags, of about four or five 
inches in diameter, to separate the large from the small fossils ; the 
•whole to be canied in a good sized blue bag or haversack, no chisel 
or hammer being necessary on this occasion. If our geologist has a 
desire to view the great section of the London clay, afforded by the 
cliffs of the north shore of Sheppey, and is content with comparatively 
the few fossils which he may be able to procure by his own exertions, 
he may proceed in the following manner. — Leaving Sheemess by the 
new town, he will pass along the sea wall, towards Minster, until he 
reaches Scaps-gate, where the cliffs begin to rise from the low lands of 
the western end of Sheppey. A few cottages are scattered round this 
point, some of the inhabitants of which work upon the beach, either 
collecting cement stone or pyrites, the latter being better known by 
the name of copperas. To these, application should be made to know 
if they have any " curiosities," and very frequently excellent specimens, 
and at a sm.all price, will be thus procured. From this point the route 
will then be beneath the cliffs upon the shingle, amidst which, dark 
patches, ten or fifteen yards in length, will be observed, composed of 



206 SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE. 

nodules of pyrites, intermixed with p3'ritized fragments of hranclies 
of trees, in great abundance. It is at such spots that the numerous 
and beautiful specimens of fossil fruits are found ; but, to ensure suc- 
cess, the collector must be content to go upon his knees, and carefully 
search among the fragments. The whole of the beach, from about 
the parallel of Minster church to Warden Point, abounds with these 
patches of pyrites, and I have by this means obtained in the course of 
a morning upwai'ds of one hundred fine fruits of various sizes. Cai'e 
must be taken in such an investigation of the coast that it be underta- 
ken during the falling of the tide, or mipleasant cnnsecpiences may 
arise from being shut in between the shoots of mud which are pro- 
jected into the sea at many points of the coast. 

If the principal object be the attainment of the greatest quantity of 
fossil organic remains, a different course should be pursued. The 
collector should then, after having made his purchases at Scaps-gate, 
direct his steps towards Minster church, passing which, he will proceed 
on the road towards Warden. About three quarters of a mile beyond 
the church, he will find a lane on his left hand, leading towards the 
Royal Oak, in which lives a woman named Mummery, and several 
others, who work upon the beach, and from whom fossils are frequently 
to be procured. These people will direct the traveller to the cottage of 
a family named Crockford, where there is usually a good assortment of 
fossils, and will direct our fossil-hunter to many other parties who also 
work upon the beach, and who reside between this point and Hens- 
brook, to which our traveller must now direct his steps. At Hens- 
brook enquiry should be made for a man named Pead, who has usually 
a considerable number of good specimens in his possession. From 
this point, Hensbrook, the collector must proceed along the top of the 
cliff towards Warden, calling at the various cottages in his way, until 
he arrives at Warden Point, at which place he must enquire for Mud 
Row, many of the inhabitants of which work upon the beach, and 
from whom a considerable addition to the specimens already collected 
may be purchased. Beyond this pohit nothing will be obtained, and 
the best way to return to Sheerness is by the road which runs through 
the most level portion of the country; the path along the north cliff 
undulates very considerably more than the road. 

The course of proceeding thus sketched ap])lies to the supposition 
that the time is limited to three days, but if a greater extent of time 
can be spared, I should recommend the tourist not to leave Sheerness 
without viewing the dock-yard ; and the return to London may be 
made by the way of Chatham and Gravesend, affording the gratification 
of a view of the dock-yard and lines at Chatham, and of the fine old 
cathedral and castle at Rochester ; and, at the same time, enabling him 
to arrive in London on the evening of the same day that he qidts 
Sheerness.

Art. I. — View of the Fauna of Brazil, anterior to the last Geologi- 
cal Revolution. By Dr. Lund. 

( Continued from page 16\.J 

In the order Edentata, there is a family which may be said 
to form a connecting link between the buiTOwing and the 
climbing mammals, and to which the Megalonyx has some 
points of resemblance : I mean the ant-bears. Let us see 
how far an examination of the construction of the hand, in 
connection with their known habits, is calculated to throw 
light on the subject before us. 

In the ant-bears [Myrmecophaga), the claws are curved and 
laterally compressed, as in the sloths, and in both we find 
these organs exhibiting the same kind of articulation ; but in 
the two larger species they are much shorter, though still of 
considerable strength. The hand is not very broad ; while the 
number of claws is only four in the larger species, and is 
even reduced to two in the smallest. It is clear that such a 
construction is not well adapted for burrowing : and accord- 
ingly 1 have satisfied myself that these animals never do 
burrow at all. They use their claws to tear open the strongly- 
built nest-hills of the Termites (white ants) ; but they are 
not able to dig burrows under ground. In the two-fingered 
ant-bear (M. didactyla) the provisions are exactly the same as 
in the sloth ; accordingly, also, it lives only in trees, where it 
subsists on the Termites that build there. Thus, if we com- 
pare the Megalonyx with that family of animals to which it 
indubitably bears the most resemblance, next to the sloth, 
the comparison is equally unfavourable to the idea of its 

Vol. IV.— No. 41. n. s. 2 b 



208 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

liaving been a burrower. The next point to be considered 
is tlie construction of the arm, which is invariably short 
among burrowing animals, as, indeed, theory would have led 
us to expect. Now, in both the Megalonyx and Megathe- 
rium the fore-limbs are long, even longer than the hind ones, 
which is only the case with some apes, and the sloths ; these 
two being, above all other mammals, the best climbers. 
Next, in the conformation of the hind feet, we find strong 
marks of distinction between burrowers and climbers ; for 
instance, in moles the hind feet are remarkably weak in com- 
parison with the fore-feet, and there is nothing extraordinary 
in their structure. So also in those powerful burrowers, I>a- 
sypus gigas, and Das. gymnurus, we observe in these parts 
the same conditions obtaining ; in none of that family is 
there anything uncommon as to their construction. 

Now, it is easy to see that the hind feet could be but of 
very little use to animals intended to burrow ; but very dif- 
ferent is the case with those intended for climbing. Not only 
must the hinder extremities afford firm support to the body, 
while the creature is climbing up, but often must they be 
entrusted with its entire weight ; for instance, when it is 
seeking for points of attachment for its fore-claws. Exactly, 
therefore, as in the burrowers the main strength is placed in 
the fore, so in climbing animals is it in the hinder extremities. 
For this reason, we often see the hand in apes without an 
opposable thumb, or with only a rudimentary thumb, or with 
none at all ; while the thumb is always completely developed^ 
and perfectly opposed, in the hind feet. So, also, in other 
families of climbers, we find the thumb constant on the hind, 
while it is often absent from the fore feet ; and for the same 
reason, the sloth is furnished with the same powerful claws 
on the hind feet that we have already seen it to possess on the 
fore feet. But both Megalonyx and Megatherium far exceed 
all these animals in the extraordinarily powerful development 
of their hind feet. The middle toe is disproportionately 
strong, and is provided with so immense a claw, that we can 
show nothing else like it in the whole animal kingdom; which 
proves that these creatures must have used their hind feet for 
some especial purpose. Their hind foot being furnished 
with a single claw, shows that it was not intended for digging : 
and the only analogy we can discover to it, is the single 
strong claw that bats have on their anterior extremities, which 
serves them to hang by. But much the most important cha- 
racter in the foot of the Megalonyx is its oblique position 
with relation to the leg, in consequence of which its sole 
turns inwards instead of downwards. We have already seen 



PllEVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 209 

that this peculiar conformation in the existing creation is 
found in the sloth, and I have pointed out the effect produced 
on that animal's habits, by this organization. An approxi- 
mation to this conformation is also observed in apes, which, 
when they walk, place the foot somewhat obliquely on the 
outer edge, and it is well known that this peculiarity incom- 
modes them in terrestrial progression, as much as it fits them 
for climbing. But what in the apes is only, as it were, par- 
tially indicated, is fully developed in the sloth ; which ani- 
mal, in consequence of this organization, has been shown to 
be confined throughout its existence to an arboreal life. 
Thus in every one of the points of comparison we have in- 
stituted between bun'owers and climbers, we have s(5en that 
Megalomjx constantly differs from the former, and resembles 
the latter : but the point to which I last alluded, 1 consider 
to be quite decisive. There is one other character in its or- 
ganization, which is not quite without weight in reference to 
our present enquiry, I mean its unusually powerful tail. Now, 
it is certainly true, that many animals which are not climbers 
have a powerful tail, as for instance, armadilloes, &c., while 
others that climb well have none, as sloths, and some apes ; 
but when we find a remarkably powerful tail attached to an 
animal, that, according to all probability, was a climber, we 
are led to infer that this organ must have served for that pur- 
pose, in other words, that Megalonyx was furnished with a 
prehensile tail. 

How far the Megatherium is to be considered in the same 
light as Megalomjx, cannot be decided without an accurate 
and scientific examination of the skeleton at Madrid. Pan- 
der and Dalton do not mention any distortion of the hind 
foot, neither does their figure exhibit any. It is, nevertheless, 
quite possible that such may exist, but that it is disguised 
by the faulty manner in which the skeleton is put up. It 
strikes me as very unlikely, that two animals which agree 
so closely in all other striking particulars of their organiza- 
tion, should differ so much in one of the most important. 
The Megatherium has been proved by later discoveries to 
possess the same powerful tail as the Megalonyx ; and as it 
besides corresponds with the latter entirely in the conforma- 
tion of its extremities, the same difficulties present them- 
selves against the supposition of its having been a burrower. 
But if the Megatherium was really a climber, it must have 
had still more occasion (on account of its greater size), for 
that peculiar arrangement of the hind feet, which we have 
described in the Megalonyx. T am aware that most people, 
from the immense bulk and clumsy make of these animals, 



210 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

will object to the view I have ventured to give of their habits. 
I confess the weight of this objection, which no one can feel 
more than I do. Indeed^ it had the effect of long preventing 
me from coming to what appeared so improbable a conclusion, 
and impelled me to a detailed and wearisome examination of 
all the relations and circumstances that could bear upon the 
subject, to discover, if possible, some other solution of the 
phenomena which the osteology of the Megalonyx presents. 
This is not the place to detail all my investigations ; but at 
least T may say this, that the more points of view in which I 
considered the subject, the more irresistibly was I led to the 
conclusion I have ventured to express ; although no one con- 
fesses more readily than I do, how much, at the first glance, 
it appears to be at variance with nature. 

In truth, what ideas must we form of a scale of creation, 
where, instead of our squirrels, creatures of the size and bulk 
of the Rhinoceros and Hippopotamus climbed up trees ! It 
is very certain that the forests in which these huge monsters 
gambolled, could not be such as now clothe the Brazilian 
mountains ; but it will be remembered, that in the former 
communication which I had the honour of submitting to the 
Society, I endeavoured to show, that the trees we now see in 
this region are but the dwarfish descendants of those loftier 
and nobler forests which originally covered these Highlands ; 
and we may surely be permitted to suppose that the vege- 
tation of that primaeval age was on a no less gigantic scale 
than the animal creation. 

In the present order of existing nature, all the mammals 
that are appointed to live in trees belong to the smaller 
kinds ; which seems so essential a condition, that in the fami- 
lies and genera containing climbers, the development of 
this faculty diminishes in a ratio corresponding to the increase 
in size of the species. Thus, in the genus Felis, the smaller 
species live for the most part in trees ; those of an intemie- 
diate size, hunt their prey on the ground, but climb with 
more or less activity ; while the largest species of all are en- 
tirely deprived of that power. Again, in the family of apes, 
the existence of the smaller kinds is indissolubly linked with 
arboreal habits ; while the larger frequently descend, and 
pass a considerable portion of their lives on the ground. So, 
also, in the ant-bears, the smallest species of all lives entirely 
in trees ; those of middle size feed principally on the ground, 
but also ascend trees ; while the very largest have the gi'ound 
assigned them for their perpetual abode. It therefore very 
reasonably excites our astonishment, to find that in a former 
period of creation, such enormous monsters should have had 
trees allotted tliem for their habitat. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 211 

But, on the other hand, we must not forget that this same 
rule which, in the existing races, is observed with respect to 
those that climb, holds equally good with reference to those 
that bunow ; which latter faculty is also restricted to the 
smaller species. Thus, in the genus Canis, foxes and jackals 
burrow, but not wolves : in the genus Lepus, rabbits bun'ow, 
but not hares : among the rodents (excluding hares and 
climbers), all species dig, except the largest of all, the Capi- 
var. Must it not, therefore, equally excite our astonishment, 
to find among the relics of that extinct creation, species of 
burrowing animals that do not seem to have yielded in size 
or bulk to the huge climbers of that same period, such as 
Chlamydotlieriimi Humholdtii, and giganteam, Hoplophorus 
Etiphractus, &c. ? And should we have brought the pheno- 
mena of the economy of that former world more into harmony 
wdth the present, by assigning to those gigantic sloths the fa- 
culty of burrowing, instead of climbing ? If we examine this 
creature's habits, we shall find that they, like everything 
else, speak equally in favour of the latter conclusion. We 
are acquainted with no single existing animal which feeds on 
nothing but grass and leaves, that digs or burrows. And for 
what purpose should these monsters have burrowed ? To pro- 
tect themselves from their enemies .? Without alluding to the 
length of time so bulky and helpless a creature must have 
required to excavate a hole sufficient for its huge carcass, of 
what use, I will ask, could such a den be for a refuge to an 
animal, whose food would, of necessity, often call it far away ; 
and which, in case of danger, was so unsuited to get safely 
back to it, from its conformation being so ill-adapted for run- 
ning, nay, as w^e have seen, even for walking or standing ! 

Should it be contended that Megalonyx had sufficient 
means of defence in its formidable claws ; I ask, for what 
purpose then did it buiTow .'' Certainly not to obtain food, 
forasmuch as all animals that seek their food underground 
(which can only consist of insects, frogs, and roots) are ne- 
cessarily small, and provided with hands, without which con- 
ditions, the impossibility of their existence in this manner is 
abundantly evident. Now, what was it that formed the food 
of these animals ? The foeces of one cf these monsters 
which T have had the opportunity of examining, presented 
very finely-comminuted remains of plants. May we not 
then conclude, that they grazed like cattle and some Pachy- 
dermata ? I answer, we find no incisors in the fore-part of 
the mouth, wherewith they could bite grass. Hence we are 
forced to conclude that they fed on leaves of trees, like their 
existing representatives, which they exactly resemble in their 



212 VIEW OF THE EXTINCT FAUNA OF BRAZIL. 

dental system ; so that, as the main result of this enquiry, I 
think I may lay down this proposition ; that, from whatever 
point we consider this gigantic animal's habits, we are com- 
pelled to conclude that they agreed in all respects most per- 
fectly with those of the living type of the family, the sloth. 

In conclusion, I will only remark, that unless we attribute 
to the Megalonyx the power of climbing, it will be difficult 
to understand how it could possibly have preserved its exist- 
ence in a country that swarmed so with beasts of prey, as 
we shall, in the sequel, see was the case in Brazil in ancient 
geological periods. Let it not be imagined that their enor- 
mous bulk, or formidable claws, were sufficient for their pro- 
tection, I have satisfied myself by numerous personal obser- 
vations, how very easily the sloths of our day fall a prey to 
predatory animals that are greatly inferior to them in size 
and strength ; and I have frequently had the most astonishing 
proofs of the fearlessness and powers of the predatory beasts 
that now exist there. It would be out of place here to de- 
scribe the scenes of battle and slaughter that have passed in 
my own house, and under my own eyes, partly with the view 
of throwing light upon this very subject. But this at least 
I can affirm, from what I have myself seen, that if the Mega- 
therium and Megalonyx, with their helpless powers of mo- 
tion, had been confined to living on the ground, they would 
soon have been exterminated ; and we never should have 
found their remains associated with those of the huge ante- 
diluvian tiger, deposited in their resting-place during those 
latter days that preceded the mighty catastrophe, which 
closed the curtain between that former, and our present 
world. 

There are three species of this genus (all different from the 
N. American species, Megal. Jeffersonii) whose remains are 
found in the diluvian soil of this district. The most common 
of them, M. Cuvieri, is about the size of an ox ; but in con- 
sequence of the massive build that distinguishes all this race, 
most of its bones, when compared with those of the ox, ap- 
pear to be two or three times larger in circumference and 
bulk. 

The two other species are much less abundant. One of 
them, Megal. Bncklandi, is the size of the tapir ; while the 
other, Meg. mimitus, can scarcely compete with the hog in 
that respect. Whether the animals of this and the preceding 
genus had any defensive armour, is a question that I have 
not hitherto been able completely to solve. Associated with 
one individual of Coelodon Maqninense I found a mass of 
granular concretions, which I cannot describe otherwise 



LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 213 

than as calcareous divisions in the skin : but among the 
very abundant remains of Megalonyx Cuvieri, I have never 
found any trace of armour, with the exception of a portion 
of an extraordinarily thick plate, whose surface presented 
what appeared ornaments in relief, so as to give it the look 
of a fragment of some architectural decoration ; but its frac- 
ture sufficiently proved its organic origin. 

Should this creature have really been furnished with a coat 
of mail, it cannot be denied that this must have as much in- 
capacitated it for climbing up trees, as all the other condi- 
tions we have examined indisputably disqualified it for ter- 
restrial motions. 

The family of sloths is at present confined to South Ame- 
rica ; therefore, in the fact of their existence in the same 
quarter during a former age of the world, we have another 
corroboration of the result to which the history of the two 
previous families led us, as to the correspondence of funda- 
mental types between the extinct and existing animals in 
that portion of the globe. In like manner, also, we find the 
other results obtained from the same former examination re- 
curring here, namely the much greater abundance of generic 
and specific forms belonging to the ancient animal creation, 
and the vastly superior size which its species attained. This 
disproportion is even still greater if we only confine our com- 
parison to the very district in which the fossil remains are 
found ; for there are now none of the family I last described 
within its limits : although I would not venture to assert, 
that they also did not exist here previously to the disappear- 
ance of the forests that originally clothed this country.

I SHALL preface the observations I am about to make on 
the Lepidoptera of the United States, by a'few remarks on the 



214 REMARKS ON THK 

causes which led ine, during my jounicy in those countries, 
to direct my attention to this order in ])reference to any other; 
and also by some short notices of the places at which I 
chiefly collected ; these being intended to afford to my readers 
(should I be fortunate enough to get any), the means of draw- 
ing more profit from what will follow, especially in regard to 
the influence of climate and locality, as well upon individuals 
of any given species as upon the geographical distribution of 
genera and species. 

The first place which I chose for a hunting ground, was 
the vicinity of the beautiful falls of the West Canada Creek, 
known as Trenton Falls. 1 had not long collected in this 
spot, when a fact which surprised me forced itself on my 
attention. This was the paucity of insects in general. There 
was, it is true, a great number of species to be met with, but 
they wanted a deal of looking for, and were almost invariably 
few in individuals. It is true, that as summer advanced, 
some one or two species of Coleoptera canne forth in countless 
thousands, especially Philochlcuma elongata, Dej., which, 
in the early part of June, stripped the young beeches of their 
leaves. Cicindela sex-guttaia, F., and vulgaris, Say, Ortho- 
soma cylindricum, and some few other Coleoptera, were also 
tolerably common. But in general, insects, though pretty 
numerous as to species, were few as to individuals of any 
species, but this was not so entirely the case in some orders 
as others. 

The great exception was the order on which I am about 
to make my remarks, to wit, the Lepidoptera, As soon as 
the young leaves had fairly burst forth, a host of beautiful 
Geometridcc began to appear in the woods, and were speedily 
followed by a second host, composed of Noctuid(B and Bom- 
hyces. The situation of the inn in which I had fixed my 
abode, was peculiarly favourable for attracting Lepidoptera 
by illuminating the windows ; and by following up this plan 
regularly, I found myself every week adding immensely to 
my stock of moths. Mr. Moore, the worthy host and owner 
of the inn, a man of sound sense, good heart and great in- 
formation, and of an intellectual turn of mind, ^ soon became 
as earnest as myself in the work of collecting. To him and 
his excellent wife, a pattern of what a wife and mother ought 
to be, I am indebted for many species I did not take myself, 
as I shall hereafter mention. 

There was enough to make me prefer the Lepidoptera 
above all other insects. I knew that not one fourth of the

LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 215 

Lepidopiera of the United States had been described ; that 
our English collections were very sparingly furnished with 
them, especially with the nocturnal ones, and I found them 
far more numerous and easy of capture than any of the other 
orders. The bias thus given, continued throughout my jour- 
ney of more than 8,000 miles, though I by no means allowed 
it to cause me to neglect other orders. 

The first place, as I have said, which I chose for a hunting 
ground, was the vicinity of Trenton Falls. It is not my in- 
tention to tell of the waterfalls, nor the deep ravine, whose 
rocky sides are overhung with gigantic trees, or adorned with 
flowers innumerable, nor to describe the beautiful banks of 
the West Canada Creek, as it flows onward to join the Mo- 
hawk, nor of the wood-clothed hills, from whose summit the 
traveller may survey a country as fair as God has ever created 
for man to dvvell in ; nor may I here tell of the kindness that I, 
a solitary wanderer, far from my home, met with in this place, 
nor of the delightful society to be found during the summer 
amongst the visitors to the Falls. I could let my pen run 
wild on these subjects, but I will confine myself to what more 
properly belongs to natural history, and that part thereof on 
which I am now treating, and merely state what was the soil, 
what the vegetation, what the local peculiarities, of the spot 
in which I first collected in America. 

The town ' of Trenton (formerly Olden Bamevelt), is situ- 
ated about fourteen miles north of Utica, in latitude 43° 20' 
N., longitude 75° 10' W., or thereabouts- The town itself 
is of considerable extent, containing about 16,000 acres un- 
der cultivation, and a population of between 3,000 and 4,000. 
A large portion of the land is still wooded, and the gradual 
improvement of this gives employ to a good many sawmills; 
fourteen, 1 believ^e, are in being within the town, though some 
have evidently declined working for some time. The com- 
mon mode of clearing is, first to cut down the larger trees, 
and then stub up the brushwood, leaving the stumps of the 
trees to decay out of the ground. If the bushes are not cut 
up, as they often are not, until the year following the cutting 
down of the trees, the ground becomes covered with brambles, 
raspberries, &c., with a variety of flowers, though these are 
not so numerous in such places as might be expected. 

Mr. Moore's house is situated on the verge of the town, 
close to the West Canada Creek, about two miles from the 
village of Trenton. Its elevation above the sea is full 1,200

216 REMARKS ON THE 

feet, and the average annual temperature 47|-°. In the se- 
vere whiter of 1836, the thermometer descended more than 
30° below zero ; the highest I ever observed it in the sum- 
mer, was but little above 80^. This, however, gives a won- 
derful range, compared with England, though by no means 
uncommon in the northern parts of the United States. * No 
doubt this intense severity of the winters affects much the 
Entomology of this part of America. 

At the back of the house was an extensive range of woods 
skirting the banks of the Creek on the western side, up to 
the village of Prospect, situated close to where the Creek 
enters the ravine. In front the country is more open, but 
beautifully diversified by large patches of wood, for every 
farm has its wood. Here and there are patches of boggy 
soil, in which grow thousands of Cypripedium spectahile, 
and a variety of ferns, of which the most interesting, perhaps, 
are Onoclea se7isihilis, and Striithioptei'is Pennsylvanica. 

In general, the soil is a rather shallow stratum of black 
vegetable mould, on a limestone bottom. This is very fertile, 
the Indian corn often producing from sixty to eighty bushels 
per acre, where the soil is not a foot deep. In some places 
there is a great deal of sand, generally forming small hills. 
I am no geologist, so will not venture to say any very great 
deal about the limestone ; howevei', I know this, that it con- 
tains a vast quantity of Encrinites, Orthoceratites, Trilobites, 
and other ites, of which I know nothing. Moore has a vast 
many beautiful specimens of fossils, amongst which the most 
interesting to me were the very perfect individuals oi Isoteles 
gigaSy and some fragments of the same, showing that it must 
have sometimes much exceeded afoot in length. From this 
account of the contents of this limestone, I leave others to 
judge whether it be transition, or any other itio7i limestone.^ 

The woods here are distinguished by the want of all the 
oaks, and all the Conifer (b, except the white cedar {Thuja 
occidentalis), the hemlock fir [Pinus Canadensis), and the 
yew, or, as it is commonly there called the running hemlock 
( Taxus Canadensis.) I do, it is true, remember, that just 
by the bridge where the road from Little Falls crosses the 
creek, there was a solitary oak, and a solitary pine, but they

evidently did not much like the neighbourhood they had got 
into. 

Having said this in regard to the woods, I need not, were 
my readers Americans, say any more about them, but as I 
suppose that amongst my readers may be some one almost as 
igr^prant on this sylvan subject as our legislators are on all 
that relates to the geography, the laws, and resources of the 
United States, I shall have to tell what trees are there. There 
are plenty of hemlocks, spreading their long dark branches ; 
there are beeches, with leaves of the lightest green ; there are 
birches too, and maples of various -species, and here and 
there the shad tree [Amelanchier hotryapium) and the bird 
cherry {Ce?-asus Virginianus) displayed their snow-white 
blossoms, and the ravine is bordered by large clusters of giant 
cedars, often of the most grotesque forms. The elms here 
attain an enormous size, though I have rarely seen them so 
beautiful in form as in the more Eastern States. I measured 
one fallen elm here which was ninety feet before it branched. 
The sycamore, or button wood, of the Americans {Platanus 
occidentalis) also occurs here, and the basswood {Tilia 
Americana), is abundant. The undergrowth consists of two 
or three species of Viburnum, Acer, Lonicera, Ruhus, Sam- 
hucus ruhens, and young growth of the various hard-wooded 
trees. On the skirts of the woods, and by the road-sides, the 
red and purple-benied sumachs (Rhus glabra and Rhus 
typhina) abounded, and the beautiful flowering raspberry 
(Rubus odoratus) hangs from the sides of the rocks, as if try- 
ing to bathe its rosy blossoms, or delicious fruit in the amber 
waves, or forms large thickets on the sunny sides of the 
wood. 

The spring, the short spring of New York, calls up a host 
of flowers here. First, the little blue Hepatica peeps from 
the clefts of the rocks, ^ and is soon followed by the fragrant 
Dielytra cucullaria, and the spring beauty [Clayionia Vir- 
ginica.) Then follow ViolcB, blue, yellow, and white ; Trillia, 
XJvulari<B, Convallariae of various species ; Aquilegia Cana- 
densis, the gold thread (Coptis trifolia), three species of Ac- 
taea, Tiarella cordifolia, Clintoiiia borealis, SU'eptopus roseus, 
and a variety of other flowers too numerous to mention. 

The march of summer is announced by the flowering of 
the Composit(B, which continue until late in autumn. In 
summer, too, various species of Asclepias, Lobelia, Desmo- 

* I have often seen this flower bhie, pale blue, and white, in America,

dium, &c., are to be found in flower, and then the ravine is in 
its beauty. I could here run riot in telling of its summer glo- 
ries; of the rocks clothed with flowers and ferns; of the dark 
branches of the cedars and hemlocks ; of the blue birds, the 
baltimores, the scarlet tanagers, that make it their abode ; but 
T must not do so. I only just hint to my readers that such 
things are, and that there are in that ravine beauties, which 
they 

" Caged in tlie space of Europe's pigmy span 
Can scarcely dream of; — whicli tlieir eyes must see, 
To knoiv how beautiful this world can be." 

So much for the spot where some of the happiest hours of 
my life were spent, and where I first learned " to honour the 
Americans as a nation, and to love many of them as personal 
friends," feelings which grew upon me more and more the 
longer I stayed amongst them. 

The period I spent in this place was from the middle of 
May to the middle of August, except that I took a short ex- 
cursion, of about three weeks, to Niagara, the borders of Penn- 
sylvania, and the central part of New York, during which 
journey, 'of about 600 miles, T travelled over some interesting 
country, never before visited, I believe, by an English travel- 
ler. That my time was not idled away during the many 
weeks I spent in that spot, I hope soon to show, by the fre- 
quent mention I shall make of it when I come to the moths. 

In August I left the house I had so long made my home, 
and proceeded west. On this journey I did not stay long in 
any one place, in fact, a few days hunting near Cincinnati, 
sometimes in company with that excellent botanist and right 
good-hearted man, Thomas G. Lea, was all I did until I 
reached Albion, in Edward's County, Illinois. At that place 
Mr. Foster (who had rejoined me at Cincinnati), and myself 
spent several days. It was at the house of a near relation 
of more than one English entomologist, that we were most 
kindly entertained. The situation was truly beautiful, and 
the fine October weather added to the pleasure derived from 
seeing Nature where man had molested her so little. The 
house stood on the edge of a small prairie, now one waving 
mass of asters, of all shades of blue and white, and sometimes 
purple, Solidagines, Rudbeckiae, and an infinity of composite 
flowers. This prairie, probably, is not above four miles long, 
and is skirted by the most noble timber, with here and there 
scattered clumps of trees. What nobleman m England has 
a park to be compared to it !

No one who has not seen them, can have an idea of the 
prairies, and I am quite sure I can find no means of giving 
anything like an idea of them, so I shall attempt it no more. 

Here the autumnal butterflies were still numerous, and there 
were a great many moths attracted by the lamps, during the 
warmer evenings. 

Leaving our Illinois friends, we proceeded to St. Louis, 
the spot where first the French settled on the banks of the 
" Father of Waters," and thence to Alton, on the same river, 
about eighteen miles north of St. Louis. We had but two 
or three days to collect here, but I was rewarded by finding 
one butterfly, never before found, I believe, in the United 
States. 

We now travelled onwards to Chicago, and thence to 
Green Bay and Mackinaw, and back to New York, a journey 
highly interesting, but which, from the season, and other 
causes, produced us but little in the way of Entomology. 
From New York we started for the south in November, 
merely staying a few days in the various cities we passed 
through, until at length we came to an anchor for about six 
months at St. John's Bluff, East Florida, which place I must 
now try to give an idea of.

Art. III. — Observations upon the Affinities and Analogies of Or- 
ganized Beings. By Hugh E. Strickland, Esq., F.G.S. 

I HAVE read with much interest the paper by Mr. Westwood, 
at page 141, on affinity and analogy. The writings of this 
gentleman are distinguished no less for scientific accuracy 
than for a spirit of sound philosophy, untainted by those 
visionary and theoretical views entertained by some of our 
modern zoologists. Instead of assuming an a priori system 
of his own, and then twisting facts into a partial coincidence 
with that system, he is content to take Nature as he finds 
her, and not the less to admire her luxuriant variety because 
she refuses to marshal her irregular troops into straight lines. 



220 OBSERVATIONS UPON THE 

circles, or pentagons. This healthy tone of mind imparts a 
high value to all that proceeds from Mr. Westwood's pen, 
and it is, therefore, with much diffidence that I venture to 
make a few remarks on the short essay above referred to. 

There is no branch of the philosophy of Zoology so ob- 
scure as the subject of affinity and analogy ; and although 
many naturalists can correctly apply these two kinds of rela- 
tions to particular cases, yet few can give any clear explana- 
tion of the rules which influence their practice. Mr. West- 
wood's remarks go deeper into the subject than those of most 
of his predecessors, yet it seems to me that he has not quite 
set the question in its true light. Before referring to his ob- 
servations, I will endeavour to explain my own views on this 
difficult subject. 

Relations of affinity and analogy are in my opinion per- 
fectly distinct from each other in every point of view. In 
order to arrive at their definitions, we must first prove the 
existence of a real natural system, a subject which involves 
an enquiry into the designs of creative power, one of the 
most awful themes which the human intellect can attempt. 
The most obvious and undeniable examples of design in the 
organised creation are seen in the adaptation of each species 
to the circumstances in which it lives. Now, if this were the 
sole mark of design, if each species constituted a being per 
se, adapted to its peculiar condition of existence, but not 
allied in physiological structure to its fellow species, there 
would then be no natural system; — man might indeed clas- 
sify such objects according to their accidental or fancied 
resemblances, but there would be none of those essential 
peculiarities of structure which we find to pervade vast 
groups of beings whose external forms are often widely dis- 
similar. The existence then of a comparatively few grand 
types of structure, or " centres of creation," from the differ- 
ent modifications of which the innumerable species now 
existing derive their characters, may be taken as a proof that 
species were created not absolutely, but relatively, — not 
merely with reference to their destined mode of life, but also 
with reference to other species whose destination was similar, 
though not identical with their own. If these views be cor- 
rect, it results that the resemblances of different species in 
essential points of structure, furnish evidences of design, less 
obvious, perhaps, but not less certain, than the adaptation of 
any one species to its external condition of existence ; and 
the " natural system" thus acquires an air of truth not inferior 
to the ocular demonstrations of anatomy. The reality of the 
natural system is not affected by the difficulty experienced

by man in detecting it ; for it is no more to be expected that 
systematists should have already unravelled all the resem- 
blances between species contemplated by the Creator, than 
that anatomists should have arrived at the final cause of every 
organ of the human body. The variety of classifications 
adopted by different naturalists, shows that we are still far 
from the true system of Nature, yet I think there gan be no 
doubt that naturalists have already sketched out its principal 
features with considerable accuracy. Who, for instance, can 
doubt that such groups as Vertebrata, Insecta, Mammalia, 
Pisces, Coleoptera, &c., are not merely human generaliza- 
tions, but real apartments in the edifice of the Divine Archi- 
tect ? It is not, however, sufficient, that man should detect 
these natural groups, — he must also give a definition of their 
characters, — not of the superficial and arbitrary ones, but 
of the essential and important, and this is often the most 
difficult part of his task. Although these essential charac- 
ters form the groundwork of the natural system, yet no rule 
can apparently be laid down for their determination in par- 
ticular cases. All that man can do is to use his best judg- 
ment in selecting such characters for a group, as seem to him 
the most important in their influence on the vital functions 
of the beings which compose it. They must, in great mea- 
sure, be left to the determination of what Linnaeus called a 
" latent instinct" which Professor Whewell defines to be " an 
unformed and undeveloped apprehension of physiological 
functions.*" 

When by these considerations we have amved at the no- 
tion of a natural system, composed of natural groups arranged 
in a determinate order, we may proceed to define affinity as 
the relation which subsists between two or more members of 
a natural group, or in other words, an agreement in essen- 
tial characters. After the essetitial characters of such a 
group have been discovered and defined, then all the objects 
which possess those essential characters are said to have an 
affinity for one another. Hence we see why the idea of a 
natural system is necessary to the definition of affinity, for 
in an artificial system the characters of the groups are not 
essential, but arbitrary, and the relation between the mem- 
bers of such a group would be, not affinity, but mere resem- 
blance or analogy. Thus, if an author were to establish the 
characters of the class Pisces, not on the essential characters 
derived from the circulatory system, but on the arbitrary one 
of being adapted for swimming, he would then include the Ce-

222 REMARKS UPON THE 

Idcea and the Phocidce among his fish. Now, on comparing 
a porpoise with a cod, no one could deny that they both 
were fish according to the assumed definition, yet no natu- 
ralist would assert the resemblance between them to be one 
of affinity. It is evident then, that the word affinity derives 
its meaning from a belief, acknowledged or tacit, in a natural 
system, and I do not see how a person who denies the latter, 
can attach any meaning to the former, as distinguished fi-om 
analogy. 

From the above definition of affinity, it follows that the 
degree of affinity is inverse to the rank of the group, in other 
words, that the members of the lowest group have the high- 
est or nearest affinity, and vice versa. The nearest of all 
affinities is that which subsists between species of the same 
genus, and the most remote is that between animals and 
vegetables, as members of the next highest group, viz. organ- 
ized bodies. The affinity between two very distantly allied 
species, is merely that between the highest separate groups 
to which they belong. Thus, the affinity between a bat and 
a goatsucker (to take Mr. Westwood's illustration), is merely 
that which subsists between mammals and birds, as members 
of the group Vertebrata, and is seen quite as perfect in the 
whale and the humming-bird, or any other examples of the 
two classes. By parity of reasoning, the affinity of a goat- 
sucker to a dragon-fly is merely that which subsists between 
the subkingdoms Vertebrata and Annulosa, as members of 
the natural group Animals, and is, therefore, quite as strongly 
exhibited in the case of a shark and a butterfly, or an ele- 
phant and a mite, &c. We thus perceive the distinction 
between affinity and analogy to consist, not in degree, but in 
ki7id, for there is undoubtedly a very strong analogy between 
a goatsucker and a dragon-fly, though the affinity, as above 
shown, is very remote. Analogy, in short, is nothing more 
than an agreement in non-essential characters, or a resem- 
blance which does not constitute affinity. Hence, analogy 
is necessarily a very partial resemblance, existing, as Mr. 
Westwood remarks, in the "numerical minority" of charac- 
ters, and often confined to one organ alone. Analogy origin- 
ates, not in the intentional relation of one species to another 
at their first creation, but in the other instance of creative 
design above referred to, viz. the adaptation of organic 
beings to their destined conditions of existence. To perform 
any given mechanical action, there is one, and in general, 
only one, arrangement of mechanical structure which is bet- 
ter adapted to that end than all others, and hence, when any 
two beings, whose aflinities are remote, are destined to per- 



AFFINITES AND ANALOGIKS OF ORGANIZED BEINGS. 223 

form a similar function, we find that they are provided with 
more or less similar instruments for that purpose. The re- 
semblance, in such a case, goes no further than the fulfilment 
of the required object, and may, therefore, be regarded as 
unintentional, or, in common parlance, accidental. For in- 
stance, there can be no question, that a lengthened form, 
destitute of sharp angles, and anteriorly pointed, is the best 
adapted for passing through the water ; and accordingly, we 
find it to prevail, not only in fish, but in Cetacea, aquatic 
birds, Dyticidae, Notonectidw, cuttlefish, &c., and man imi- 
tates it in his naval constructions. Yet we have no evidence 
that such resemblance is intentional, or in other words, that 
whales and Dyticid(B were created for the sake of resem- 
bling fish, but we merely suppose that in each case, the boat- 
shaped structure was given to adapt the animal to an aquatic 
life. The examples of these analogies are innumerable, and 
appear to me to be owing to the fact, that the real variations 
of circumstances which this planet affords are very few, com- 
pared with the number of organized beings destined to inhabit 
it, so that the performance of the same function continually 
recurs in different groups of the natural system, and requires, 
in each case, a corresponding or analogous organization. 
Thus, e. g. there are not more than four principal varieties 
oi locality, viz. the air, the ground, shallow water, and deep 
w^ater. These four variations of habitat have determined the 
structure of the four orders of birds, Insessores, Rasores, 
Grallatores, and Natatores. Again, the twofold division of 
food into animal and vegetable, has caused the group Rap- 
tores to be divided off" fi-om the Insessores, and w^e thus get 
the five groups under which the class, birds, is commonly 
arranged. Now, as every other species of animal must in- 
habit one of the above four localities, and must feed on one 
of the above two kinds of food, it follows that the organs of 
locomotion and of nutrition, are susceptible of comparatively 
very few grand differences of structure, and that the inhabit- 
ants of the same element, or the eaters of the same food, 
must present numerous points of resemblance, quite indepen- 
dent of their natural or essential affinities. This it is which 
has given to distantly allied groups an appearance of regu- 
larity in their analogies, whence has arisen the " theory of 
representation," respecting which I will take occasion to say 
a few words. 

The theory of representation announces, that " the con- 
tents of every circular group are symbolically or analogi- 
cally represented by the contents of every other circle in the 

Vol. IV.— No. 41. n. s. 2d 



224 REMARKS UPON THE 

animal kingdom. '" This lias always appeared to mc one of the 
most unsound and unphilosophical of the doctrines main- 
tained by the advocates of the circular system. It seems 
derogatory to Creative Power to suppose that the principle 
of representation had any place in the scheme of creation, 
or that certain organs were given to species, not with a view 
to the discharge of certain destined functions, but for the 
apparently useless object of imitating or representing other 
species in a distant part of the system. The advocates of 
this theory would have us believe that the long tail of the 
horse was given it, not for the purpose of brushing off flies, 
but in order to represent the long " tail" [train] of the pea- 
cock,* and that both pigs and humming-birds have small 
eyes, because they are the tenuirostral types of their respec- 
tive "circles." 2 Without wasting words upon the serious 
discussion of such puerilities, I will merely repeat my de- 
liberate conviction, that relations of analogy are not to be 
regarded as affording any evidence of 7r^occl§£a-ig, or intention, 
in the scheme of creation, but are mere coincidences of struc- 
ture, incidental to the grand design of adapting a large num- 
ber of organized beings to perform a comparatively limited 
number of functions. 

It will be seen that the above view of affinity and analogy 
differs considerably from that of Mr. Westwood, in p. 143 of 
this Magazine. Mr. W. seems to regard affinity and analogy 
as the same relation under different points of view, and as 
depending upon the numerical majority or minority of the 
points of agreement between the objects compared. Mr. 
Westwood's views may be explained by the following tabular 
arrangement, showing the number of points of agreement 
between four analogous genera.

According to Mr. Westwood, the dragon-fly would be said 
to have an affinity to the bat or goatsucker, and an analogy 
to the DioncBa, because it agrees with the former creatures in 
three points, and with the latter in only two. Again, the bat 
has an affinity to the goatsucker, from agreeing with it in

four points, and an analogy to the dragon-fly and Dionaea, 
from agreeing with them in only three and two points re- 
spectively. So that an affinity subsists between the bat and 
dragon-fly, when compared with the Dioncda, and an analogy, 
when compared with the goatsucker. This seems to me to 
be a correct statement of Mr. Westwood's views, if I rightly 
understand them, and they certainly merit the praise of inge- 
nuity. It seems to me, however, that they contain a fallacy, 
owing to Mr. W. not having attended to the distinction be- 
tween essential and non-essential characters. Thus, the 
words organized) animal, and vertebrate, in the above table, 
refer to characters of the highest importance to the vital 
functions of the creature, and consequently, to its place in 
the natural system, whereas the word Jiy-catching merely 
relates to a point of detail in the habits of the creature, of 
very secondary value, compared to the former characters.' 
I should say then, that these four creatures have affinities ior 
one another, in consequence of their agi-eeing in the essential 
characters above stated, and that the degree of their affinities 
is proportionate to the number of the essential points in 
which they respectively agree, but that their analogies are 
derived solely from the one non-essential point oi fly-catcliing , 
which applies to them all in an equal or nearly equal degree. 
In short, however strong may be the analogy which the 
goatsucker bears to the dragon-fly, I do not consider that it 
has any more affinity to the latter, than it has to a beetle, a 
lobster, or any other of the Annulosa. 

Since writing the above, I have referred to the very valu- 
able remarks by Mr. Blyth on affinity and analogy, in * Mag. 
Nat. Hist.,' vol. ix. p. 399, &c., to which I had not suffi- 
ciently attended at the time of their publication. His views 
appear to me to be more nearly correct than any others which 
I have seen in print. The chief point in which they differ 
from mine, is in the introduction of a third term, approxima- 
tion, as distinct both from affinity and analogy. Mr. Blyth 
considers it to be a strong resemblance between certain mem- 
bers of groups really distinct, and he illustrates it by the 
similitude oiAnthus to Alauda, of Ornithorhynchus to birds, 
of Myxine to Mollusca, &c. Now, it seems to me, that this 
approximation resolves itself into affinity or analogy, accord- 
ingly as we admit one or other of these two propositions, 
either that natural groups are quite distinct from each other 



* I only mean that the character oi Jly -catching is unimportant in com- 
paring groups of such high rank, but of course it becomes an essential 
character when applied to smaller groups, such as families or genera.

in every pari of their contents, or that they touch or show 
a tendency to touch each other at some particular point. 
Thus, if we suppose all birds to be equally distinct in essen- 
tial structure from all mammals, all Vertebrata from all 
Mollusca, it is plain that the approximation between Orni- 
thorhynchus and birds, and between Myxine and Mollusca, 
resolves itself into mere analogy. But if birds have a ten- 
dency to unite with mammals by means of Ornithorhynchus, 
and Vertebrata with Mollusca by means of Myxine, then 
this approximation must be regarded as an affinity. So that 
in either case, approximation is not to be considered as a 
distinct principle, but only as an undetermined analogy or 
affinity. 

With regard to the above enquiry, I am inclined to believe 
that the larger natural groups are not only widely separated, 
but have no real tendency to unite, — that no mammal, for 
instance, is in essence any nearer a bird, — no vertebrate any 
nearer a mollusc than another. Be this, however, as it may, 
we cannot assert the same complete separation of natural 
types, when we look to the smaller groups. There can be 
no doubt that the lower groups, such as families and genera, 
do, in numerous instances, come into contact, or pass into 
one another, and in other cases, where the contact is not com- 
plete, yet a tendency towards it is very evident, and in such 
cases, the approximation becomes one of real affinity. Such 
is most probably the case with Anthus and Alauda, quoted 
by Mr. Blyth as examples of approximation.

Art. IV. — Notice of a few rare Plants , collected principally during 
the Autumn of 1839, in Jersey. By Joseph Dickson, Esq. 

The subject which I now bring before your notice, appears 
to me to be one of considerable interest, for two reasons : — 
First, as relating to a field, which those who are really fond 
of Botany, and who wish to make their herbariums as com- 
plete as possible, will not fail to visit ; many plants being 
found in this island, which, if not entirely wanting, are for 
the most part extremely rare in the British Flora. The se- 
cond reason is, that no slight degree of controversy exists, 
as to whether the plants of this and the neighbouring islands 
should be included in the English or French Flora. 



BOTANY OF JERSEY. 227 

As far as I am able to institute a comparison (having visited 
Brittany and Normandy), the Botany of Jersey (more parti- 
cularly the N. E. parts), much more resembles that of the 
above provinces of France, than of the southern counties of 
England. 

Mr. Babington, of Cambridge, having given a very able 
sketch of the history of Guernsey and Jersey in a little work 
lately published, I refrain from giving any description of them, 
fearing to trespass too far on the part of your valuable jour- 
nal allotted to this paper. I cannot, however, help noticing, 
that there is one locality in Jersey which Mr. B. appears to 
me not to have visited ; I refer to a place called " Les Veaux," 
a beautiful spot towards the S. E. part of the island, con- 
sisting alternately of wood and plain, mountain and valley, 
and where the plants that are found are of the richest, rarest, 
and most luxuriant kinds. 

It may not be out of place here to correct an erroneous 
statement I have seen in some works on Botany, namely, that 
Centaurea Isnardi is found in pastures in the Isle of Jersey. 
From four years constant study of the Botany of this island, 
I think I may safely affirm that no such plant is fomid there ; 
in this view I am supported by the testimony of several other 
botanists : it is, however, found in one spot in Guernsey, on 
the authority of Mr. Babington. I will now proceed to the 
immediate object of the present paper, by giving a list of the 
plants I have found in the above-mentioned island.

FOSSIL SHELLS OF THE CRAG. 231 

Coralline crag, Ramsholt and Sutton. 

I propose to give the generic name Pleurodon, to a small 
coralline-crag shell, which it seems to me cannot properly be 
referred to any genus hitherto established. The Nuciila 
miliaris of M. Deshayes, if not specifically identical with this 
shell, must be closely allied to it ; and in placing the French 
fossil in the genus Nucula, M. Deshayes has expressed a 
doubt as to the correctness of his determination, in conse- 
quence of the existence of the lateral tooth. The affinities 
of Pleiirodofiy as indicated by the shell alone, probably justify 
its being placed with the Arcacece ; though its precise posi- 
tion in that family cannot be determined in the absence of a 
knowledge of the animal. 

At Ramsholt the valves are generally found united, the 
large prominent teeth retaining them in apposition. I have 
given as a synonyme the above name of Deshayes, presum- 
ing his Nucula miliaris may be the same shell, but T am un- 
able to discover the internal pit for the ligament he speaks of, 
and which his figure so conspicuously displays. The crag 
specimens have a depression placed externally to the teeth 
on the shorter side, where I imagine the ligament to have 
been situated. Deshaye's figure shows seven teeth, whilst 
the shells from the crag never display more than six, and sel- 
dom more than five.

T feel unwilling to give a new name to this shell, since a 
very scrupulous examination inclines me to the behef of its 
not being specifically different from a well-known British 
species, although it was a matter of some difficulty to satisfy 
myself on this point. My crag specimens vary much, as do 
also the recent shells : a young one of the latter in my pos- 
session, corresponds with the fossil in all respects except in 
the direction of the teeth, which, in the recent, are vertical, 
while in the fossil, those placed towards the extremity of the 
hinge-line are much inclined : I believe, however, that in the 
recent shell this character may be occasionally observed. — 
The longitudinal rays, in some specimens, are regular and 
single, in others they are alternately large and small. The 
lines of growth are very distinct ; the shell is thickened by 
the lateral muscular impressions ; the chevron-formed lines 
in the ligamental area are about four or five. Small specimens

from the coralline crag are sufficiently abundant ; those from 
the red crag occur but rarely. 

The two figures referred to I consider to be of the same 
species ; but must leave it for further observation to confirm 
or refute this opinion.

This shell differs from Area laetea in being rather more in- 
equilateral, and in being less angular at its anterior margin : 
the ligamental area is also so much smaller as, in my opinion, 
to render its separation from that species necessary. The 
rays are numerous, and decussated by lines of growth ; the 
teeth in the centre of the hinge-line are vertical, but they be- 
come gradually inclined towards its extremities. Specimens 
fi'om the red crag are often much distorted, like the recent 
shell, so as to be nearly equilateral and scarcely transverse ; 
but the anterior side always preserves a more rounded form 
than any of the recent specimens that I have seen. There is 
a small sinus in the basal margin. One antique specimen 
fi'om the red crag measures an inch in its transverse diameter.

An abundant species. The teeth in this shell are similar 
in their arrangement to those of Cuenllaea, but the valves of 
that genus are described as being closed and free, while in 
this there is a sinus in the margin, and probably it was an at- 
tached shell. The teeth are generally three in number on 
the shorter side, making an angle of 45° with the hinge-line, 
and three on the longer side, w^hich are nearly horizontal. — 
The shell is longitudinally striated, and the stricD are cut by 
elevated lines of growth, giving to the exterior a cancellated 
appearance; the anterior side is rounded; posterior suban- 
gulated ; muscular impressions indistinct.

An abundant shell in both the red and coralline deposits, 
and very variable. I have included the whole of the above 
synonymes, considering them all to refer to the same species. 
Among a hundred specimens of the crag fossil, some may be 
found thick, tumid, and longitudinal ; others thin, lenticular, 
and transverse. After a careful examination of an immense 
series of specimens, I cannot detect any character sufficiently 
permanent to warrant a separation of the crag from the re- 
cent shell. The number of teeth in the younger shells is up- 
wards of twenty, but the central ones become obhterated. 
The large obtuse angle on one side is rather more strongly 
marked in the recent shell, but it is visible in most of my 
specimens. At most it would only constitute a variety. One 
antiquated specimen in my possession has only three teeth 
remaining. The chevron-formed lines in the ligamental area 
(from five to eight), are deeply impressed in some specimens 
but obsolete in others, even when the valves are found united, 
so that the above condition could not be a result of subsequent 
attrition. My largest specimen measm'es a little more than 
three inches across, but a magnificent specimen of the recent 
shell from the Mediterranean, in the possession of Mr. G. B. 
Sowerby, has attained the diameter of nearly six inches. 

A number of specimens of the same species from Sicily, 
obligingly sent me by Madame Power, exhibit the same va- 
riations in character, although a slight obliquity prevails 
among the generality of them. 

I have given a figure of this shell, for the purpose of show- 
ing the difference between it and another crag Pectunculus, 
which I regard as new. In many instances however the for- 
mer shell contrasts much less strongly with the new species, 
than in the one which I have had drawn for illustration.

1 consider this a distinct species, from its obliquity and 
general uniformity of character ; when compared with the last 
species, it is thinner, the hinge never so broad, and the urn- 
ho is but slightly prominent ; externally it is covered with 
numerous fine strice ; the chevron-formed lines are eight or 
nine in number, and deeply impressed. 

At the above locality these shells are very abundant and in 
good preservation, the valves being frequently united, an un- 
common occurrence with the bivalves found in any other lo- 
cality of the red crag. If this really be a distinct species 
(and I have given my reason for thinking it such), the dura- 
tion of its existence was very short, the creation and extinc- 
tion appearing to be limited to the period of the red crag.

Abundant. This shell appears to agree with the descrip- 
tion and figure above quoted. The four teeth on the anterior 
side are nearly horizontal, while four of those on the other 
are vertical and very prominent, the two most lateral, angu- 
lated. The arrangement of the teeth in the figure of the Si- 
cilian shell is indistinct, and the description merely says, — 
" dentes circa decern." The shell is striated and sulcated, 
by which the exterior has a cancellated appearance ; the 
longitudinal strice are visible internally ; a few on the ante- 
rior angle are more conspicuous ; the margin is crenulated all 
round. This species, and a few others, have been put into a 
separate genus (Limopsis), in consequence of the central del- 
toidal pit in which the ligament appears to have been placed, 
instead of being spread over the whole area; between the 
hinge line and umbo a small opening is visible in those spe- 
cimens where the valves are found united. Pectunculus na- 
nus of Deshayes differs in the arrangement of the teeth, and 
in having the longitudinal stri(B more strongly marked : his 
figure does not show the deltoidal pit.

OllTHAGORISCUS MOLA. 235 



Art. VI. — Description of a Specimen of the Ortliagorisciis mola 
(Sun Fish), caught off the Irish Coast in June, 1839, and pre- 
served in the Museum of the Natural History Society of Dublin. 
By O'Bryen Bellingham, M.D., &c., &c.* 

The Orthagoriscus mola, (the Tetraodon mola and Diodoti 
inola of former writers), the short sun-fish of English au- 
thors, so very rarely occurs upon our coasts, and the descrip- 
tions and figures, more particularly the latter, given by 
naturalists, vary so much, that I have drawn up a short 
account of the very fine specimen before me, and at the dis- 
section of which I assisted. 

It was caught off the coast of Acklow, by some fishermen 
belonging to Kingstown, on the 29th of last June, by means 
of a noose thrown over it, while apparently asleep upon 
the surface of the water ; from them it was purchased by 
T. Dixon, Esq., a member of the council of this Society, 
and by him has been most liberally presented to our Museum. 
It has been, I need hardly observe, admirably preserved by 
Mr. Glennon. 

The fishermen stated, that when seized, it made several 
ineffectual attempts to escape, and splashed the water in a 
furious manner, throwing up great quantities with its tail. 

The majority of the specimens of this fish which have been 
taken off the British coast, have been observed floating upon 
the surface of the water. Mr. Couch says that in calm wea- 
ther it often mounts to the surface, and lies, probably asleep, 
with its head partly above water, presenting the broad surface 
of one side to view, and floating with the tide. It seems, 
says Dr. Neill (speaking of one brought to him), " to be a stu- 
pid dull fish ; it made little or no attempt to escape, but 
allowed one of the sailors to put his hands under it, and lift 
it fairly into the boat :" Mr. Couch, however, says that he has 
known it to make powerful efforts to escape, just as the fisher 
men describe this one to have done. 

The Orthagoriscus mola belongs to the order Gymnodontes, 
the characters of which are " no true teeth, but the jaws are 
covered with a lamellated substance resembling ivory, either 
entire or divided in the middle by a suture : opercle small ; 
branchiostegous rays five upon each side, deeply concealed," 
and to the genus Orthagoriscus, in which, "the jaws are undi- 
vided, body very much compressed, short, truncated behind,

cated by the author to the ' Mag. Nat. Hist.' 



236 DESCRIPTION OF A SPECIMEN 

rough, but without spines, not capable of inflation ; dorsal and 
anal fins high and pointed, uniting with the caudal." 

Two species of Orthagoriscus are described to inhabit the 
British seas, Or. mola and Or. ohlonga. Lacepede, however, 
asserts, that there is no specific distinction between them, 
and Gmelin makes the Or. ohlonga, a mere variety of the 
Orthagoriscus mola. 

The colour of the specimen, the subject of the present 
communication, when recent, was dusky grey upon the back, 
speckled with silvery white upon the sides ; belly silvery. 

The cuticle was very rough, with innumerable minute 
prickles ; these were largest and most prominent about the 
lips and upon the head. 

It weighed one hundred and ninety-six pounds. 

It measured 4 feet in length ; its greatest depth was 2 feet 
4 inches, and its greatest thickness near the head, 14 inches. 

The dorsal and abdominal edges were sharp and keel- 
shaped ; a transverse depressed line appeared to mark the 
distinction between the body and the caudal portion. 

The dorsal and anal fins are opposite each other ; each is 
19 J inches long, and 9 inches broad, at the base. 

The pectoral fin on right side is larger than on left, mea- 
suring 7 inches in longest diameter, vfhich is diagonally from 
above downwards and backwards. 

From the centre of the pupil to the angle of the mouth, 
6|- inches, and fi:om centre of pupil to anterior edge of bran- 
chial aperture, 6|- inches. 

The vent is 4 inches anterior to anal fin, and an inch be- 
hind the vent is the external opening of the urinary organs. 

Number of Fin-Rays. 
Pectoral, 13 ; Ventral, 16 ; Dorsal, 18. 

These measurements were all made and noted down before 
the animal had been skinned. The dissection was performed 
by Mr. Glennon, superintended and assisted by T. Dixon, 
Esq., Dr. Gilgeons, and myself. The mouth is small, con- 
sists of two lips, and two solid, undivided, bony jaws, theupper 
having a groove to receive the under; their edges are jagged 
and sharp. The gape of the mouth is 2 inches, its width 
3j inches. 

Above the mouth is a moveable proboscis which projects 
an inch beyond the upper lip ; its point is protected by a bony 
scale convex anteriorly, and resembling the common limpet- 
shell. 



OF ORTHAGORISCUS MOLA. 237 

There is another bony scale 6 inches below the inferior 
maxilla, which is 2 inches long and 1 inch broad. 

The aperture of the eye is somewhat oval, 2 J by 2 inches 
in the long diameter from before backwards. The eyes have 
a deep blue colour, the iris silvery white, -| of an inch wide ; 
when the eyeball was pressed inwards, a white membrane, 
resembling the membrana nictitans, appeared, and could be 
made completely to cover the eye. 

The branchial aperture is situated an inch anteriorly to the 
pectoral fin, its length is 3 inches, its breadth 2 inches, the 
long diameter being from above downwards ; it is closed by 
a loose fleshy valve. 

The dorsal and anal fins are very long and pointed, their 
anterior margin straight and thick, their posterior thin and 
rounded, and continuous with the caudal portion. 

The pectoral fins are much smaller, have a rounded figure, 
narrower at the base, they are attached horizontally ; the 
pectoral of right side is a little larger than that of left. 

The caudal portion of the animal consists of nine semicir- 
cular lobes, the convexity directed backwards, the central lobe 
the largest, measuring 4j inches from above downwards ; be- 
tween each pair of these lobes is a deposit of bony matter, 
firmly connected to the integuments; these are eight in num- 
ber; they are nearly an inch in length; their concave edge 
looking backwards. 

The palate and tongue were provided with a few sharp 
curved teeth. 

The alimentary canal measured 1 1 feet 6 inches in length ; 
its coats were strong and thick ; there was no apparent dis- 
tinction between stomach and intestine : the alimentary canal, 
near the cesophagus being little wider than at its termination. 
As there was no mark by which to distinguish the junction 
of the stomach with the intestine, it could not be said whe- 
ther the biliary duct opened into the stomach or duodenum. 

The gall bladder was very large, as also its duct. The 
liver was of a considerable size. The urinary bladder was 
large and thick ; its interior surface plicate. 

The stomach and intestines contained some fragments of 
corallines, with much viscid mucus. 

The alimentary canal contained, in addition, several spe- 
cies of Entozoa, which are new, I believe, to the British 
Fauna. In the stomach and intestines I found great numbers 
of the Bothriocephalus microcephalus, and of the Distoma 
nigrqflavitm, besides a species of Distoma which does not 
appear to have been described. In the liver and peritoncewn 
were several of the Anthocephalus elo7igatus, and upon the 



238 DESCRIPTION OF A SPECIMEN 

gills many of the Disto7?m contortum. Attached to the gills, 
were also a few specimens of a very remarkable crustaceous 
parasite, which have been preserved by Mr. Dixon, and will, 
probably, prove to be new to the Fauna of this country. 

This short account of the internal anatomy of this rare 
fish, may, perhaps, appear to be very superficial : my apology 
must be that the dissection was conducted under very 
unfavourable circumstances ; it was made in the open air, 
and upon the ground in the commissioners' yard at Kings- 
town, in a position where we were liable to continual inter- 
ruptions. Moreover, my time being limited, the examina- 
tion was necessarily more hun*ied than I could have wished ; 
and I had no means of preserving any of the parts for a 
more extended and careful examination. 

The figures given in different works intended to represent 
this species, are, many of them, veiy unlike the present spe- 
cimen. In Bloch's figure, which appears to have been copied 
into Shaw's work on Zoology ; in Donovan's and in Pennant's 
figures, and in that given in the best and most recent work 
upon British fishes, by YaiTell, the caudal portion of the ani- 
mal is represented to have all the appearance of a fin, the 
rays being distinct. 

The figure which Dr. Jacob has given in the last number 
of the ' Dublin Philosophical Journal,' of a specimen which 
he dissected, represents this part pretty accurately, but in 
other particulars it differs materially from the specimen before 
me. In his figure, the shape of the pectoral fin is materially 
different ; the number of fin-rays was also not the same, and 
the animal was shorter in proportion to its depth. No writer 
appears to have noticed the bony deposits upon the probos- 
cis and below the inferior ynaxilla, nor those between the 
lobes of the caudal portion of the animal. 

In the ' Historia Piscium Francisci Willughbei,' published 
at Oxford in 1686, is contained a description of the Ortha- 
goriscus mola, which is accurate in many particulars ; the 
figure is also very good for the time. The specimen from 
which he took his description was upwards of 2 feet in 
length. " The body short and deep, posteriorly provided with 
a circular pinna, or tail ; the skin not scaly, but hard, thick, 
and rough. Colour on back blackish, belly silvery ; mouth 
very small for a fish of its size. MaxillcB hard, sharp and 
rough ; eyes small ; where the body passed into the caudal 
portion, the skin was marked with a transverse band, or de- 
pression." 

" Liver large, thick, and whitish ; gall-bladder very large ; 
its duct opened into the stomach, not far from its superior 



OF OTiTHAGORISCUS MOLA. 239 

orifice ; spleen small and dark-coloured ; urinary bladder 
very large, the urethra not terminating in the anus, but open- 
ing externally by an orifice peculiar to itself, a little behind 
the a7iusy 

I have only seen two other specimens of the Orthagoris- 
cus mola; one is preserved in the Museum of the Iloyal 
Dublin Society ; it is much smaller, and its depth is greater 
in proportion to its length than in the example before us : 
the other, Mr. Robert Ball has very kindly given me permis- 
sion to exhibit to the Society this evening ; it is evidently a 
younger fish ; it agrees, however, in every particular except 
in size, with the specimen before us. 

In a communication which I have very recently had with 
Mr. Ball, he says "between the years 1818 and 1825, I saw 
five of these animals off the coast of Youghal ; three were 
dead, and two of them are in my possession, the specimen I 
send is the larger." "Considerable difference exists in the 
thickness and other proportions of the caudal portion of the 
animal ; in the young it is very thin ; the bony tubercles are 
also probably much dependent in number and size upon age. 
A specimen which I saw in Professor Harrison's Museum, 
only a few inches long, was much more like the figure in 
Yarreirs work. There seems to be a regular gradation from 
his, through mine, up to the specimen contained in the Muse- 
um of the Natural History Society." 

In conclusion then, it would appear that the specimens of 
Orthagoriscus mola which have been figured and described 
by British writers, were young fish, whereas the subject of 
my present communication is evidently a nearly full-grown 
animal ; and this will sufficiently explain the reason why their 
descriptions and figures do not tally in every respect with 
the specimen upon the table. It does not appear to me to 
be at all necessary (as a member of our Society seems to 
think), that we should look out for some new genus to place 
it in. Its characters agree in every particular with those of 
the genus Orthagoriscus, as laid down in one of the latest 
and best works upon British Animals, 'Jenyns' Manual;' 
and that it is the Orthagoriscus mola, I have the additional 
authorities of Mr. William Thompson, Mr. Robert Ball, and 
Mr. Wilde, all of whom have carefully examined it, and 
whose opinion upon such a point, no person in Dublin is 
competent to call in question. But if additional evidence 
be wanting, I may mention, that the four species of Entozoa 
which occurred in it, are identical with those found in the 
Orthagoriscus mola by Cuvier, Rudolphi, and Bremser ; and

three of those species have never been found to inhabit any 
other fish. 

Subjoined is a short description of these Entozoa, speci- 
mens of which I have the pleasure of presenting to the Na- 
tural History Society. 

Di STOMA contortum. 

On the gills of the sun-fish were a great number of this 
species. 

They are cylindrical ; the longest 10 or 11 lines in length ; 
colour white anteriorly, yellowish-red posteriorly: they almost 
all assumed a curved form (as Rudolphi has described, and 
from which he has given the name). 

The anterior pore is small and circular, the ventral larger, 
elliptical, or circular ; in some seated upon a peduncle nearly 
the length of the neck. The neck measured nearly 3 lines in 
largest specimen, it is convex upon dorsal, concave on ventral 
surface ; it, as well as the head, is armed, particularly upon 
the convex surface, with numerous minute spines ; these are 
not continued posteriorly beyond the ventral pore. The body 
is cylindrical, its greatest diameter being behind the ventral 
pore, and diminishing gradually towards the caudal extremity. 
The ova are very small, and exceedingl3r numerous ; they 
have a yellow colour, and appear to be the cause of that 
colour in the posterior part of the body. 

This species has only been found upon the gills of the 
Orthagoriscus mola. 

Di STOMA nigrqflavum. 

The intestines of the sun-fish contained several Distoma 
which have most of the characters of Distoma nigrojlavum, 
but I could not see the aculei which Rudolphi describes upon 
the head and neck. 

The longest specimen was an inch and a half, others about 
three quarters of an inch ; their colour in some parts black, 
in others yellowish ; the head white. 

The ventral pore is pedunculated ; the peduncle in a few 
being as long as the neck, from which circumstance they bear 
a close resemblance to the Distoma furcatum, and might 
even pass for this species, as Rudolphi has remarked. The 
body of the animal is cylindrical and slender, nearly of the 
same diameter throughout ; the skin is flaccid. 

This species Rudolphi has only found in the alimentary 
canal of the Orthagoriscus mola.

BoTHRiocEPHALus micTOcepkalus. 

The intestines of the sun-fish contained an immense num- 
ber of this species ; the longest was upwards of 3 feet in 
length : colour white : the widest part of the body was a little 
more than 3 lines. Several of them lived in water for twenty- 
four hours. 

The head is small, triangular, or sagittate, terminating 
anteriorly in a little papillaiy eminence. The hothrii, or 
depressions upon the head, are two in number, of an oval 
shape, wider posteriorly ; there is no neck ; the anterior 
articulations are funnel-shaped ; they gradually become 
longer, then shorter, and in some individuals the most poste- 
rior articulations are merely transverse rugcB. The articula- 
tion which terminates the body is smaller than the others. 

Rudolphi describes this species as being found only in the 
Orthagoriscus mola. 

Anthocephalvs elongatus. 

This species was discovered by Cuvier, in the liver of the 
Orthagoriscus mola : he created a new genus for it, which he 
called Floriceps ; but as it agrees in every respect with the 
genus Anthocephalus established by Rudolphi, it is now 
placed there. 

The whole surface of the liver was marked with the cysts 
of this species, the longest which I was able to extract was 
7 inches, and it was not complete. 

The body of the animal is soft, flattened in parts, in others 
nearly cylindrical : it terminates posteriorly in a caudal vesicle ; 
the head is provided with two ear-shaped depressions, and 
four retractile armed tentaculcB. 

E-udolphi has found this species in the liver and mesentery 
of the Orthagoriscus mola, in the mesentery of the Centrono- 
tus glaucus, and also in the Scicena aquila.

Sir,

has been the means of bringing me a very valuable and 
somewhat voluminous coiTCspondence, touching botany gene- 
rally, and ferns more particularly. A great portion of the

information which I liave thus obtained, valuable as it now 
is, would have been still more so had I possessed it previ- 
ously to the appearance of the monograph ; for a detached 
Appendix is nearly sure to be lost, and if I refrain altogether 
from publishing, in the chimerical hope of a second edition, 
the loss seems equally certain ; I therefore gladly avail my- 
self of your kind pennission, to insert in the ' Magazine of

I am indebted to Mr. Bladon, of Pont-y-pool, for the fol- 
lowing note. 

" In many of the open mountainous parts of Wales, where 
it grows abundantly, the Brakes is cut down in the summer, 
and after being well dried, is burned by the cottagers in large 
heaps, for the sake of the alkali contained in the ashes: when 
sufficiently burned, enough salt-water is sprinkled on the 
ashes to make them adhere together, when they are rolled 
into round balls, about two inches, or two-and-a-half in dia- 
meter. These balls are thoroughly dried, and carried about 
the neighbournood where they are made, for sale in the mar- 
kets ; and they are also frequently kept by shopkeepers, to 
supply their customers. The price of these balls varies in 
different seasons, from ^d. to ^d. per dozen. They are very 
much prized by some housewives, for their utility in the 
wash-house, in economizing the use of soap. When about 
to be used they are put into the fire, and when heated to a 
red heat, are taken out and thrown into a tub of water ; the 
water, in the course of an hour or so, becomes a strong ley, 
and is then fit for use.''

limestone rocks, at an elevation 1550 feet above the sea, 1050 
above the town of Settle : in company with it are found ^5- 
plenium viride and Polystichum Lonchitis, the latter spar- 
ingly. Mr.Tatham observes, " the representation of Pol. Lon- 
chitis at page 44 (of the * British Ferns ') is excellent ; the 
masses of thecce with us are generally confined to about a 
third of the frond, but I have some that are half covered." 
I shall, perhaps, be pardoned, for citing this laudatory pas- 
sage ; my object is to show that Mr. Tatham considers the 
Irish plant figured at p. 44, as identical with the Settle 
plant. 

Note 3. AspLENiuM Trichomanes of Authors. 

This fern is, generally speaking, constant in its form, and 
rather remarkable for its uniformity of appearance. I have, 
however, received a beautiful and very marked variety from Mr. 
Samuel Gibson, of Hebden Bridge, near Halifax, in York- 
shire : the pimice, instead of being nearly entire, as is usually 
the case, are deeply pinnatifid, as represented in the accom- 
panying figure, and the pinnulce or lobes are irregularly den-

tate. The specimens sent by Mr. Gibson are perfectly without 
fructification, but I do not know whether this is to be consi- 
dered a character of the variety, or incidental only to the 
fi-onds I have received. The lower figure is a facsimile 
representation of one fi*ond, as regards form and size, the 
upper figure represents a portion of a fi-ond, in which the 
divisions are still more irregular. 

This beautiful variety appears to have been known to our 
earliest botanists, two previous figures of it existing in their 
works ; neither of them, however, represents the fronds quite 
so deeply divided as in the present instance. One figure is 
in Plukenet's ' Phytographia,' tab. 73, fig. 6, the plant being 
described in that author's ' Almagestum Botanicum,' p. 9, as 
*^ Adianium fuaritimmn, segmentis rotundioribus : " it is 



244 CORRESPONDENCE, &C. 

stated on the authority of Sherard, to have been found in 
Jersey. The second figure is in Tournefort's * Institutiones 
Rei Herbariae,' tab. 315, fig. 6. It is also noticed in Dille- 
nius' edition of Ray's ^ Synopsis,' and by Smith, in the * En- 
glish Flora,' where it constitutes the variety /3 of Asplenium 
Ti'icliomanes. The variety y of Smith, to which that author 
quotes Sir Robert Sibbald's description (" 7>^. aliud, foliis 
mucronatis profunde incisis,''^ 'Scotia Illustrata' sec. 2. p. 52) 
appears to have little resemblance to the variety, or even 
species in question, if I may venture to judge from the figure 
(Sibb., tab. iii. fig. 4) to which Smith refers ; but as to the 
correctness of the reference, I am unable to speak, for Sib- 
bald himself has, in no way that I can discover, connected 
the text and figure. 

Mr. Gibson's plant was gathered at Kant Clough, four 
miles fi*om Burnley, in Lancashire : it was originally disco- 
vered there in 1832, and some plants taken up at that date 
and planted in a garden at Halifax, have been found to retain 
their remarkable character in cultivation.

Missionary Settlement, 
Achill Island, April 8, 1840. 

Sir, 

I am indebted to the kindness of some anonymous corre- 
spondent, for the following extract from an article entitled ' Notes on 
Irish Natural History,' which appeared in the 36th number of your 
Magazine; and as it contains what seems to me very uncandid misre- 
presentations of the character of the establishment which is entrusted 
to my superintendence, I trust your sense of justice will induce you 
to publish this letter, supplying the facts, which the writer of the 
article to which I have alluded has thought fit to suppress. 

The objectionable passage to which my attention has been directed, 
is as follows ; — 

" The natives of Achill are charged with being thieves and mur- 
derers ; and if I were to place full reliance on all I heard at the Set- 
tlement, they would appear to be so. Mr. Long, however, with every 
thing constantly exposed (walls and hedges being here unknown), and 
living amongst a population from whom he has no power to defend 
himself, has never lost even a potato. I allude not to this politically, 
but bearing in mind solely the natural history of the island, and its 
ca2)ability of improvement, I pronounce, without hesitation, that if 



CORRESPONDENCE, &C. 245 



goodness of soil, lowness of rent, cheapness of labour, and safety of 
property be recommendations, then that no spot I have ever seen, is 
more likely to reward the emigrant than the island of Achill. Would 
that some unpolitical and unsectarian philanthropists, men who took a 
human view of the human wants and human failings of these poor 
islanders, would settle among them, and place in their hands the 
plough and the spade, teach the children to read and write, the boys to 
make shoes and coats, to fish, and to dig, and rake, and sow, and reap, 
and build houses ; and the girls to knit and spin, and make gowns ; 
use them like brothers and sisters and children, then might this island 
become a centre of happiness and prosperity." 

I am sure. Sir, that candour will constrain you to admit, that any 
person forming a judgment of our proceedings from the statements 
contained in the above extract, would conclude that we took no care 
whatever to promote the temporal interests of our poor neighbours, or 
the general improvement of the island. 

This is a most unfair and ungenerous misrepresentation. We are 
at considerable cost and much labour, " teaching the children to read 
and write," " the boys to make shoes and coats, to build houses ; " 
" the girls to knit and make gowns, &c.," and the men to adopt an im- 
proved system of agriculture. But, Sir, as I wish to give you proof, 
and not assertion, let me call your attention to the following extracts 
from the authorized report of the evidence given before the Committee 
of the House of Lords, which sat on the Irish Education System, in 
1837. The first witness, from whose evidence I make the following 
brief extract, is J. Dombrain, Esq., Inspector-General of Coast-guard 
in Ireland. 



" Were you ever in the Island of Achill officially ? 

Several times. 

In the course of the last two years ? 

I was there last summer and the year before. 

Did you visit the Protestant settlement there ? 

I did. 

In what state did you find it ; was it in a state different from the rest of 
the island, or like the rest of the island ? 

Very different from the rest of the island. 

Was it in a state inferior or superior ? 

Very superior. 

In what respect ? 

Generally superior in respect of industry and cultivation ; it had superior 
buildings, and everything that would stamp an appearance of civilization 
in a very remote district. 

As far, therefore, as appeared to you, it would be a great blessing to the 
island, if the example so set could be followed through that island ? 

Decidedly." 

Such, Sir, was the sworn testimony of Mr. Dombrain. — Not less 
decisive is the evidence of another witness, Francis Reynolds, Esq., 
chief officer of coast-guard, who was examined before the same Com- 
mittee. 



240 CORRESPONDENCE, &C. 

" How long have you been in Acliill ? 

I have been in Achill this last time six years. 

Had you ever been there before ? 

I had, for three years. 

What interval was there between the two times of residence ? 

About three years. 

You were, therefore, there when Mr. Nangle came in 1 834 ? 

I was. 

Did you see any improvement produced in the island ? 

I did ; I saw great improvement in the cultivation of the land, and also 
in having schools for the instruction of the children. 

Did the people testify any feeling toward Mr. Nangle at that time ? 

They always appeared to me at the time to be very fond of Mr. Nangle, 
and to like him very much. 

When were the first iudications of a different feeling towards Mr. Nan- 
gle? 

When the priest gave orders to shout after the protestants whenever they 
saw them." 

This evidence needs no comment. * * ^- * 

The allusion to Mr. Long, in the article which has called forth 
these remarks, induces me to believe that it was written by an English 
tourist, who paid a hasty visit to this island last summer. 1 think 
his name was Newman. I accompanied that gentleman and the Rev. 
William Prior Moore, Head Master of the College of Cavan, who 
was then at the settlement, to Mr. Long's, and I shall now detail the 
whole of the conversation, from which the writer in your Magazine 
has selected so much as suited his purpose. 

As we walked across the mountain, I remarked, that a system of 
petty thieving prevailed generally in Ireland, to an extent which ope- 
rated as a check on the expenditure of capital for the improvement of 
the country ; and I attributed the prevalence of this evil to the Romish 
doctrine, which teaches that a sum, amounting to some shillings, may 
be stolen from a gentleman without the guilt of mortal sin. 

When we arrived at Mr. Long's, the English tourist asked him 
whether he had suffered much from petty depredation. He replied 
in the negative. I remarked that that could readily be accounted for, 
as he lived in the centre of a large tract of land, where there was not 
a single human habitation within a mile of him. To this Mr. Long 
assented, at the same time remarking, that he was further secured 
against depredation, by there being no thoroughfare through the valley 
in which his house was situated ; but, added Mr. Long, notwithstand- 
ing these peculiar securities, I have a man summoned at this moment, 
for cutting my grass. Here the conversation ended : Mrs. Long 
then came into the room, and without knowing the subject of our 
previous conversation, she began to speak about the coast -guai'ds in the 
next village, saying that they complained sadly that they could not 
have a garden, for such a sy stein of thieving 'prevailed in the village, 
that their neighbours would not leave them so much as a cabbage. 
I immediately told our English tourist to note that. It seems, how- 
ever, that my admonition was unheeded ; this unsectarian and unp- 
olitical gentleman, in the j^lenitude of his liberality, was determine 



CORRESPONDENCE, &C. ' *2 17 

to shut his eyes and close his ears against every fact which did not 
square with his preconceived theor}'. 

Permit me further to remark, that if the writer of the article in 
your Magazine means to say that I described the Achill islanders as 
sinners above the rest of their countrymen, he grievously misrej^re- 
sents my sentiments. I believe that all men, whether they be Papists 
or nominal Protestants, if unconverted and unregenerated, are alike 
sinners before God. Without at all infringing on this truth, I admit 
that some men are naturally more gentle and tractable as regards their 
intercourse with their fellow-men, than others ; and I have always 
given the Achill people credit for a large share of this animal amiability ; 
indeed, I never experienced anything but kindness from them, until 
their passions were kindled by the inflammatory harangues of their 
priests ; since then we have lived in an element of violence and out- 
rage, many of us have suffered personal violence, and one has been 
murdered. I allude to Mr. Reynolds, whose testimony T have quoted 
in a former part of this letter. We, however, do not repine. I trust 
we can say of our persecutors, in the forgiving spirit of our blessed 
Master, *' Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." 

The establishment entrusted to my superintendence being depend- 
ant for support upon the voluntary contributions of the christian pub- 
lic, I trust that a sense of justice will constrain you to publish this 
reply to the misrepresentations put forth by the writer in your Maga- 
zine, which, if uncontradicted, might tend materially to diminish its 
claims upon their benevolent assistance. 

I am. Sir, 

Your faithful Servant, 

EDWARD NANGLE. 

To the Editor of the ' Mag. Nat. Hist.' 



[When our correspondent, Mr. Newman, in his " Notes on Irish Natural 
History" incidentally alluded to the ' Settlement' at Achill, we knew no- 
thing of the nature of that establishment, and consequently we did not 
foresee that the wish expressed in reference to " unpolitical philanthro- 
pists, &c." involved anything like a reflection upon the institution carried 
on under Mr. Nangle's superintendence. The reasons assigned by the 
writer have induced us to give insertion to the present letter, but we can- 
not find room for any further discussion upon the morality of the people 

Why an anonymous correspondent should have taken the trouble to send 
Mr. Nangle an extract from our pages, but have left it to his ingenuity to 
guess who might be the writer of that extract, is a matter we don't quite 
understand. We have shortened the communication, but in so doing have 
omitted nothing of importance to the legitimate object of the writer. — Ed.] 

Dublin Natural History Society. — Extract of a letter from the 
Secretary to the Editor, dated April 20, 1840. — "It has often 
occurred to me, that the Natural History of Ireland had been wo- 
fully neglected, there being no public collection of it in Dublin, 
nor any place where young men interested in its investigation could

meet. The Dublin Society (I presume), regarded this as a mat- 
ter of less importance than the pursuit of other branches of science ; 
and besides, the expense of becoming a member of that body was 
very considerable. Under these circumstances, a new Society ap- 
peared to me to be the only way of supplying the deficiency, and in 
March, 1838, with the aid of my friends, the Rev. B. J. Clarke 
and R. R. Williams, Esq., the Dublin Natural History Society was 
ushered into the world. You may easily imagine the difficulties we 
had to contend with, through evil report, and through good report, we 
have carried oji the Society step by step, until it has attained a degree 
of prosperity we never thought of arriving at, and I am sure, little 
expected b^' those who were opposed to us at first. Its objects are, 
the forwarding of the Natural History of [reland exclusively, as we 
consider, that while engaged in this, the Society will be of real import- 
ance ; while, were we to merge into the more ample field of foreign 
productions, we should be insignificant. The above object we have 
endeavoured to bring about, by making a standard collection of the 
natural productions of the island, and by having evening meetings, 
where papers relative to it may be discussed. Our collection, by the 
kindness of the members, is already far advanced : the conchological 
pan, the most so of any : Mr. Warren having presented 140 differ- 
ent species of the marine shells, and the Rev. B. J. Clarke, nearly all 
the land and fresh-water shells of Ireland. The sun-fish, too, is a 
great source of attraction, from its curious appearance. The ornitho- 
logical part of the museum is rapidly increasing, and altogether, our 
collection is in a very fair way. At any rate, when a stranger comes 
to Dublin now, he may be shown something of the natural produc- 
tions of Ireland, a thing fonnerly out of his power to see, except in 
private collections. Among the papers that have been read, there has 
been much interesting matter ; a paper on the sun-fish, by my friend 
Dr. Bellingham, I believe is sent to your Magazine for pubhcation. 
Our finances (the most important point), are flourishing, for, though 
our subscription is only £l. we had, at the last quarter, a balance of 
£80 in the Treasurer's hands. The number of our members is 220. 
Altogether, from the nationality of our objects, — from the papers that 
are read often being interspersed with popular lectures, — from the 
good feeling that exists among our members, — I firmly and con- 
scientiously believe, no society in Dublin has so much hold on pub- 
lic opinion ; and supported as we are by members of most of the other 
scientific bodies of the metropolis, sanctioned by the University, whose 
respected head is one of our members, and who has borne most ample 
testhnony to our efficiency and utility, and encouraged by all who 
wish well to our national institutions. I cannot but look forward to 
a continued course of prosperity." — Henry H. Dombrain. 

Mr. Denny s forthcoming work on the Anoplura. — You are 
aware, doubtless, of the work I have in hand : to procure the insects 
for illustrating which, has cost me above 12 years : and though I have 
been assisted by friends in various parts of the kingdom, with speci- 
mens of the lice of quadrupeds and birds, still there are several which 
I have never been able to procure. When I first began seriously to 



DESCRIPTIONS OF CKYrTOCEPHALI. 249 

think of publishing, I considered that about 100 species, (which is 
20 more than Mr. Stephens' gives in his Systematic Catalogue), 
would be as many as I should get. I have now, however, made 
drawings of 173 species, which occupy 22 plates; besides which, I 
have several still by me to figure, which have occurred since, so that 
with these, and some others I am in search of, I shall not be surprised 
if I reach 200 species : whether, however, I am in the end enabled to 
publish, is a mystery, as my expenses for each copy will be consider- 
ably above the price fixed, £1. Is. Standish, who coloured Curtis's 
Entomology, estimates the colouring of the plates alone, that is, the 
173 species, to amount to 16s. 6d. per copy; and I have many other 
items to add. — Do you think that out of your numerous correspon- 
dents you could induce any of them to send me the lice I am most in 
want of, (that is supposing such fell in their way) ? Whether they ai'e 
from British examples of the animals, birds, &c., or from continental 
ones, is of no moment, as the same species will have the same kinds 
of parasite all over Europe. The specimens might be sent in a letter 
very easily. W hat I want most are the lice of the hare, otter, hedge- 
hog, squinel, pine marten, mole, shrew, donnouse, fox, seal, rat, mouse, 
bat, red deer, roebuck, — bustard, black stork, crane, roller, golden 
oriole, Cornish chough, bee-eater, little bittern, quail, pratincole, ger 
falcon, merlin, eagle owl, little owl, scops owl, northern diver, gieat 
auk, little auk, avocett, stilt plover, little bustard : — most of these are 
so rare that there is little hopes of obtaining them, still specimens 
might occur, upon which, if any friend would search, he might be able 
to do me an essential service, as after so long a time spent upon the 
subject, I am extremely anxious to render my work (whether publish- 
ed by myself or a bookseller), as perfect as possible. I have received 
very gi-eat assistance from Mr. Selby, Sir Wm. Jardine, Rev. L. Je- 
nyns, Mr. Thompson of Belfast, Mr. Tweedy of Truro, — but still 
you will see that it is exceedingly difficult to get the materials for 
such a monograph as I meditate. Many of the above lice might be 
found, I, am sure, by searching dried skins of the animals ; as 1 have 
detected several upon birds in our museum, which had remained under 
the feathers for many years. Professor Bunneister of Halle informed 
me a few days since in a letter, that he is also engaged upon a thick 
4to vol. on the Epizoica. — Henry Denny. — Philosophical Hall,

Hoopoe taken at Fishguard, Pembroke, — It may be mat- 
ter of interest to your ornithological correspondents to know 
that a Hoopoe was shot by Mr. James Bowen, at Llwyngwair, 
near Newport in Pembrokeshire, on the 6th of this month, and 
is now in the possession of Dr. Rowland, 57, Wimpole Street, 
London. It came into the drawing-room at Llwyngwair, ap- 
peared tame, and was observed to take its food in the peculiar 
manner mentioned in your Maguzine, vol. ii. p. 596. The 
last shot in this neighbourhood on record, is that mentioned 
in Fenton's History of Pembrokeshire, page 17. — Henry

Second Order, ACLEIDOTA. 
First Family, Ruminantia. 

Without doubt, one of the most remarkable phenomena con- 
nected with the geographical distribution of the class of Mam- 
malia, is to be found in the very unequal apportionment of 
the genera of ruminants in the warmer regions of the two 
great continents. While Africa and Asia possess all the 
several genera belonging to this family, the new world pos- 
sesses only one of its members, ^. e. the genus Cervus, together 
with the single sub-group of Camelus. The latter being 
entirely confined to the mountain chain of the western coast, 
there remains only the single genus Cerviis for the whole 
vast extent of the South American plains, with their subordi- 
nate ranges of hills. This poverty of genera in the family 
Ruminantia, did not characterize the ancient fauna of this 
region ; for besides the genus Cervus, I have discovered two 
others belonging to that period. The fossil remains that I 
possess of the genus Cervus, may be referred to two species, 
of which one is about the size of Cervus sim/plicicornis. 111., 
the other, nearer to Cerv. campestris. The genus Antilope 
has left remains of one species. Ant. Maquinensis, as large 
as a buck, with short bow-shaped horns, curved backwards. 
It was a gregarious animal, like its congener, which is now

252 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

confined to the old world. For a further description of this 
animal, and a drawing of its cranium, I must refer to my 
paper on the cave of Maquine. 

Of the genus Camelus, I possess the remains of two spe- 
cies ; one exceeding a horse in size, the other a little less. 
To which of the two sub-groups of this genus the fossils 
belong, that is, whether to the modern inhabitant of the warm 
regions of the old world, Carnelus, 111., or to that now found 
in the chain of the Andes, Auchenia, 111., my insufficient 
means of comparison will not allow me to decide. 

I conclude this family with a small group that does not 
exactly coincide with any one of its existing genera. This 
genus, which, in the lightness of its form, rivals the most 
agile of the antelope tribe, departs far from that group in the 
details of its structure, as also from the goat, sheep, ox, and 
camel. In some isolated points, it approaches the genus Cer- 
vus, while in others, it differs from it more than do any rumi- 
nants from each other. I propose the name of Leptotherium 
for this extinct genus, of which I possess the remains of two 
s])ecies, one less than the roe, the other bigger than the stag 
[^' crown-liar t V]. If, now, we take a comparative view of 
the genera and species of this family, in the former and pre- 
sent periods, we must remark, in the first place, the much 
greater abundance of generic forms that distinguished the 
ancient creation, inasmuch as their numbers are in the pro- 
portion of four to one. Of these four, Leptotherium is en- 
tirely extinct : with regard to the genus Camelus, I have 
already observed, that the insufficiency of my means of com- 
parison prevents me fi'om deciding whether the fossil species 
belong to those of the old world, or to the sub-group of 
this continent. But, if I might be allowed to venture a 
speculation on this subject, I should declare for the latter 
opinion, on the strength of a rule which we shall, in the se- 
quel, see confirmed by many examples, namely, that the ani- 
mal species of the ancient world exceeded in size the corre- 
.sponding species of the existing races : and we have seen 
that the fossil species of Camelus are considerably inferior 
to those of the old continent, while they somewhat surpass 
those of the new world. 

In regard to the genus A?itilope, it is well known, that in our 
times, the warmer portions of Africa and Asia constitute its 
dwelling-place. At the same time I must observe, that one 
of the latest travellers in Chili, M. Gay, believes that he has 
recognized a species of antelope, in the descriptions given 
him by the natives, of an animal that inhabits the inacces- 
sible regions of the Andes. Should this supposition prove 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 253 

correct (at which we should not be surprised, when we 
remember that other animals, more likely to attract man's 
attention, such as the tapir and the bear, had escaped the 
observation of naturalists, in those very same mountains, 
until a very recent period), we are then brought back to 
this remarkable result, that two genera, which are at present 
restricted to the highest chain of the South American coast, 
were in the age of our fossil remains extended over its plains. 

The discovery of an animal form, now usually considered 
as peculiar to the old world, among the purely American 
forms such as the extinct fauna of this quarter has hitherto 
produced, being a fact of great importance, I thought it 
right to allude to this novel information, while 1 reserve my- 
self from giving any positive judgment, until farther en- 
quiries shall have enabled M. Gay to verify or disprove this 
report. 

But not only the number of genera, but also the total 
amount of species, was greater in those days, than now. 
There are now five species (all as before mentioned belonging 
to the genus Cervus) that inhabit this district : while 1 al- 
ready reckon seven species of the four fossil genera. The 
great number of species which the genus Cervus now con- 
tains within this region, inclines us to suspect that our know- 
ledge of the fossil species is very far from being complete. 
The circumstance of these animals living solitary, or at most 
in small herds, together with their rapidity of flight, secures 
them from the attacks of predatory beasts, much more than 
animals that either live in large societies, like the cloren- 
footed, or which are bad runners, as the Tardigrada ; and this 
accounts for our finding their remains so seldom in the caves 
of wild beasts, in comparison with those of the other classes. 
Therefore, as the main result of our enquiry respecting this 
family, we see that of the four genera of which it was com- 
posed in that former period, only one still continues to exist 
in this same district ; two must be sought for in the higher 
chain of the Andes (or perhaps only in the warmer zones of 
the Old World), and finally, one has entirely disappeared 
from the surface of the earth. 

Second Family, Pachydermata. 

This family at present contains only two genera belonging 
to Brazil ; the tapir, with one species, and the peccari [Dico- 
tyles) with two. I am in possession of fossil bones, which evi- 
dently belong to the first genus ; but they are too imperfect 
t > determine their relation to the recent animal. 



254 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

Among the immense quantity of remains referrible to the 
latter genus, I can make out at the least four species, very 
distinct from each other, and equally so from the two recent 
species, one of the fossil nearly doubling in size either of 
the recent. 

But it seems that a tJdrd genus of this family formerly 
inhabited this district. I have found the dorsal vertebrae of 
a large animal, which, both in form and size, agree with 
those of the elephant. The peculiar shape of these bones 
renders it impossible to confound them with those of any 
other large animal belonging to either the extinct Tardi- 
grada, or to the existing Pachydermata. At the same time, 
as I am aware that the bones of the Mastodon have been 
discovered in Brazil, and as I have not the means of ascer- 
taining how nearly the vertehrce of this animal resemble 
those of the elephant, I am willing for the present to sup- 
pose the fossils 1 have found may belong to the Mastodon ; 
partly because I do not wish to insert any doubtful animal in 
this catalogue ; and partly because I feel it would be wrong 
to build so important an hypothesis as the former existence 
of the elephant in South America, upon any but the surest 
foundation. I should, perhaps, remark, that the bones I have 
hitherto obtained of this animal, differ in their external ap- 
pearance from all the other fossil bones I possess : and rather 
resemble the partly decomposed bones of the recent period. 
They are also the only bones that have not been dug out of 
the diluvial soil of the caves, under my own eyes; but were 
found lying loose upon it. It will be remembered that I have 
endeavoured to account for this circumstance in a previous 
part of my communication ; to which I therefore refer. 

We thus see that the family Pachydermata was richer 
formerly than now, both in genera and species, and also that 
it appeared under more colossal forms. 

Third Family, Ferm. 

At the head of this family naturally stands the genus Felis, 
which, notwithstanding the number of its species, yet con- 
stitutes one of the most natural and best defined genera in 
the whole class of Mammalia. The hunting leopard {Felis 
juhata, Linn., Cynailurus, Wagl.), which differs from the 
rest of the Feles in many essential characters, has very pro- 
perly been formed into a separate genus. Its claws are not 
retractile ; it is gregarious, and of a mild disposition, so 
much so, that it is frequently tamed, and employed in the 
chase. But as a remarkable contrast to this, its dental sys- 
tem is upon a more murderous plan than that of the true 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 255 

Feles, not possessing the flat projection on the large tearing 
molar of the upper jaw, which is found in all the other pre- 
daceous genera, and the development of which is in inverse 
proportion to the animal's carnivorous propensities. I have 
recognized this form of dentition in a small animal of the 
extinct Fauna of this region, which does not exceed the 
domestic cat in size ; and which, for that reason, I call Cy- 
nailurus minuta. Besides this, T have discovered the re- 
mains of two species of the normal feline form ; one as large 
as the long-tailed tiger-cat (Felis macroiira, Pr. Max.), the 
second, larger than the jaguar, (Felis On^a, Lin.), and 
comparable to the largest species of the old world, the tiger 
and the lion. The genus Canis, at present comprises two 
species in this district ; of which one [Canis Azarcs) resem- 
bles our fox in size, form, and habits ; while the other (the 
Guara, Cants juhatus), differs more from its congeners. Its 
extraordinarily high legs, and halting gait, exhibit a resem- 
blance to the Hyoina, which, however, its timid disposition 
does not bear out. In like manner, I have found traces of 
two species of this genus, among my fossil remains. One 
of them {Canis protalopex), evidently belongs to the sub- 
group of Vulpes, although the fi-agments I have as yet ob- 
tained are not sufficient to determine its exact relation to the 
living species. The other [Canis troglodytes), belongs to 
the more carnivorous division of wolves and jackals. The 
far greater lightness of its extremities distinguishes it well 
from the Guara, and brings it nearer to the European wolf, 
from which, however, it differs in its longer and weaker neck, 
a character that again approximates it to the Guara. It was 
equal to either of them in size, and committed fearful havoc 
among the antediluvian inhabitants of these regions, whose 
remains are found amassed together in the caves that served 
for its den. Scarcely less frightful were the ravages com- 
mitted by another predatory animal, not much bigger than 
our fox ; which, in general character, mucli resembles the 
jackal division of the genus Canis, but differs from all of that 
class in the more powerful development of its dental system, 
and the absence of the hindmost tuberculated molar in the 
under jaw. Its principal food consisted of the various spe- 
cies of Paca, to which latter genus belongs that enormous 
quantity of bones I have described in my account of the 
cavern of Cerca Grande. For this remarkable animal (which 
may be considered as a sub-genus of Canis, in like manner 
as Cynailurus may be regarded a sub-genus of Felis), I pro- 
pose the name of Speothos, or jackal of the caves; and for 
the species here described, which is the only one I hitherto 



256 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

know, I offer the specific name pacivorus^ from the animal 
that formed its chief prey. 

There is a small group of Fer(B, peculiar to South Ame- 
rica, called by the Brazilians Eirara, which forms a passage 
between the Digitigrada and Plantigrada, and serves to 
unite the genera Giilo and Mustela.^ There are two species 
known of this sub-genus, which is hitherto without any sys- 
tematic name ; and whose species have therefore been classed 
by some with Gulo, by others with Mustela : — ¦ Viverra vit- 
tata, and Mustela harhata of Linnaeus ; which latter, how- 
ever, in consequence of an original error in the printing, is 
now generally called harbara. Another genus, Nasua, at 
present confined to this continent, existed also here in the 
former period. I possess the remains of one species, but too 
imperfect to decide on its relation to existing species. 

But the most remarkable animals that frequented this dis- 
trict in ancient times, are the two I next proceed to describe, 
the bear and the hyaena ; both of which are now lost to its 
Fauna. The fossil Brazilian bear {Ursus Brasiliensis), is 
far inferior to the gigantic species whose remains occur in 
the European caves ; and must even be classed among the 
smaller kinds of the existing race, though it is distinguished 
by its massive build. On the contrary, the fossil Brazilian 
hyaena (HycBua neogado), will rank with the largest recent 
species ; although even in this respect, it must yield to those 
monsters of this same genus, whose relics have been found 
so abundantly in the caves of the old world. If we now 
compare the genera of this family, with reference to the two 
epochs under our view, we find that of the five which now 
inhabit this district, viz. Fells, Canis, Lutra, Nasua, and 
Eirara (for I am compelled to use this for want of any proper 
systematic name), four have been already discovered to belong 
to the more ancient period. Lutra is, therefore, the only one 
of which I have hitherto found no remains. But this may 
easily be explained, without concluding that the genus was 
entirely wanting to the antediluvian Fauna of Brazil. The 
otter neither frequents caves itself, nor is it likely to become 
the prey of beasts that do so : it is, therefore, not to be won- 
dered at that we do not at once discover this form, at the 
very first glance we cast over these fossils. We may. there- 
fore, consider ourselves justified in assuming that the former 
system of animal creation in these parts, contained all the 
genera of the FercB we find occurring there at the present 
day. But we have seen that in addition to these, the 
previous system possessed four other forms that do not now 

' Galictis of Prof. T. Bjll. Sec 'Zool. Trans, of Loml.' v. ii. p. 201.— Ed. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 257 

exist ; of which two [Cynailurus and Speothos) may be con- 
sidered sub-genera of Felis and Cams, while the other two, 
bear and hyaena, constitute proper genera. Thus the propor- 
tion of genera between the former and the present period, is 
as eight to five. Again, of the five existing genera, three, 
namely, Felis, Canis, and Lutra, are common to both conti- 
nents ; but Nasua and Eirara are peculiar to the new world. 
The presence, therefore, of these two last genera among the 
fossil Fauna, supplies one more link in support of the propo- 
sition I have already laid down, that the animal world was 
framed upon the same plan in the former epoch, as now. 
Of the four fossil genera not now found in America, Cy- 
nailurus and Speothos have each a living representa- 
tive in the warm regions of the old world. Already in our 
examination of Ruminantia, we are made acquainted with 
a genus belonging to the extinct creation of this continent, 
the antelope, which at least seemed to present a similar con- 
nection ; but at the same time, as there remained some room 
for doubt, I would not ground so important a result on an 
indefinite fact. So also with reference to the examples I 
have just produced, doubts may be entertained as to these 
geogi'aphical relations ; partly, because the equivalent forms 
are only to be considered as sub-genera ; and partly, because 
it may be supposed, that from the great external resemblance 
which the first {Cynailurus), undoubtedly bore to the true genus 
Felis, we may possibly hereafter discover its peculiar dental 
system in some one or other of the less known existing spe- 
cies of Felis on this continent. It is, therefore, better to 
abstain from any positive decision on the subject at present ; 
the rather, as the history of the next genus I am about to de- 
scribe, shows the necessity of caution in grounding results 
on negative evidence. The bear was believed, until within a 
few years, in spite of Molina's account, to be peculiar to the 
old world and North America : later discoveries, however, 
have proved that at least one, if not several species, inhabit 
the mountains of Peru and Chili. I'he latter are distinguished 
from the others of their race by their inferior size : and as 
we have seen that the fossil Brazilian bear exhibits the same 
proportions, I consider this latter as nearer related to that of 
the Andes, than to that, either of the old world or of North 
America. Thus in this genus, we have a confirmation of 
the supposition we hazarded respecting the antelope, which 
affords another example of that very remarkable geographi- 
cal relation, that the Andes now possess the representatives 
of several animal forms, which, in ancient times extended 
over the elevated plains of South America. The constant 



258 VIEW OF THE EXTINCT FAUNA OF BRAZIL. 

repetition of this singular fact might ahnost tempt one to 
ask, whether it be not possible that the last genus that re- 
mains to be described, the hyiuna, may not be similarly cir- 
cumstanced ? I must, however, observe, that however well 
founded such a supposition may appear, when it regards an 
animal like the antelope, whose timidity and shyness with- 
draw it from the neighbourhood of man, and whose speed 
and activity enable it to distance all pursuit, it loses its force 
when it regards an animal whose habits incline it rather to 
seek man's proximity ; and whose voracity and fearlessness 
at the same time render it so bad a neighbour, that its exist- 
ence can scarcely remain unobserved. The existence, there- 
fore, of the hysena, in that ancient period to which our fossils 
belong, is a phenomenon that fairly authorizes the conclusion, 
" that the last extinct, and so remarkably rich a Fauna, which 
inhabited the elevated plains of tropical South America, 
among its great abundance of peculiar American forms, con- 
tained also some which are now confined to the old world." 
If we compare the relative numbers of species of this 
family in the two periods, it is true that the list of fossil spe- 
cies will not be so numerous as that of the recent ; but we 
ought not, on that account, to conclude that the family of 
FercB was poorer in species formerly than now, as will ap- 
pear evident from the following considerations, and which 
are equally applicable to the next family. All the remains 
w^hich I have as yet obtained of the extinct Fauna of this 
continent, have been disinterred from caves, and belong 
partly to the predatory beasts which lived there, and partly 
to the animals which served them for food, and which were 
dragged in by them either entire or piecemeal. We could not, 
therefore, expect to find in these receptacles of the bones of 
their prey, the remains of such animals as either their nature 
or habits withdrew more or less from the attacks of the larger 
beasts. All the above described animals are those which 
form the regular food of the larger predaceous classes; whence 
we find their bones very abundant in these dens. But it is 
a very different case with the smaller Ferce. The sharpness 
of their senses keeps them away from danger ; and the va- 
rious retreats they all possess, such as the tops of trees, or 
holes underground, or, as in the otter's case, the water, pro- 
tect them from almost any pursuit of the larger beasts, 
which at once accounts for the extreme rarity of their bones 
in these situations. If we give due weight to these consider- 
ations, and at the same time remember the great proportional 
number of species we have already found at the very first 
glimpse we have cast over this antediluvian Fauna (there 



ON THE COLOUR OF THE RIVER SPONGE. 259 

being only three wanting to equal the amount of existing 
species), I think most surely, that every one will rather be 
led to the opposite conclusion, that the number of species 
was greater in that former period than in the present. With 
respect to the number of genera, we have already proved 
this position to a certainty, and we may, therefore, conclude 
that this family presents the same condition as all those pre- 
viously described, namely, that it was richer both in genera 
and species, in former geological periods, than now.

Art. II. — On the Action of Light upon the Colour of the River 
Sponge.' By John Hogg, M.A., F.R.S., L.S., C.P.S., &c., Late 
Fellow of St Peter's College, Cambridge. 

Having for several years past observed many variations in 
the colour of different specimens of the river sponge {Spon- 
gilla Jluviatilis), (1^) although growing in, or inhabiting the 
same rivulet, and during the same season of the year, I was 
at first led to attribute the difference of age as the most pro- 
bable cause of those variations. But a circumstance oc- 
curred to me in the summer of 1837, which has indisputably 
afforded the true cause of this variation in colour; and, as 
I consider it to be of great interest, I do not hesitate to pub- 
lish a notice of that circumstance, and of the experiments 
instituted by me, as well towards its elucidation as towards 
its full and direct confirmation. 

The circumstance alluded to is this : during August 1837, 
whilst searching for some good specimens of the Spongilla 
JliiviatiUs, which is not unfrequent in a rivulet of beautifully 
clear water at Norton, in the county of Durham, for the pur- 
pose of making observations on its supposed animal nature, 
I dragged from the bottom of the stream a flat piece of tile, 
having a patch of sponge growing upon its upper surface, of 
a bright green colour, and also another patch of the same 
species growing to its under surface, but which was of a pale 
brown, or sand colour, and not in the least tinged with green.

260 ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT 

Supposing then that the situations in which the two 
patches of sponge were respectively placed, ( one being ex- 
posed to the light, and the other deprived of it), formed the 
real cause of the difference of colour in them, I took home the 
tile in a vessel of water, and commenced the following 
experiments, in order that I might, if possible, prove the 
coiTectness or falsity of my conjecture. 

On the 1 8th August, 1837, the day in which I obtained 
the fragment of the tile, I lost no time in returning home 
with it, carrying it in a vessel filled with water, very gently, 
and with great caution, lest the living specimens of the 
sponge should be in any way shaken, or broken, or otherwise 
injured. I then placed the tile in a basin of fresh water, but 
exactly reversed the position of the two patches of sponge, 
that is to say, I put the underside of the tile with the pale 
hrown piece of sponge growing to it uppermost, and exposed 
it to the light in a window, where I allowed the whole rays 
of the sun to enter and shine upon it ; and the original upper- 
side of the tile, containing the green patch of sponge, of 
course, then occupied the underside, and vvas almost entirely 
deprived of light. I changed the water twice or thrice a 
day, adding it fresh from the pump, and not rain water, or wa- 
ter taken from a pond, or in any way intermixed (as far as I 
could possibly ascertain), with any fresh vegetable or colour- 
ing matter. After a couple of days, I thought the brown 
piece of sponge began to assume a greenish tint, and the 
green piece under the stone to lose, though in a less degree, 
somewhat of its deep colour ; these appearances, after a few 
days more, became distinctly manifest, and by the 29th 
of August, the brown or sand-coloured patch of sponge had 
changed to a bright grass-green, and the green patch on the 
under surface of the tile had diminished in its green 
hue, and had approached to a light grey. At length, 
after the expiration of twenty days, the upper sponge had 
much increased in depth of colour, and the lower one had 
lost a good deal of its green, (2) and had changed to a light 
brownish green, resembling, indeed, the colour of the patch 
when originally growing to the underside of the tile, as I 
had first observed it upon taking it out of the rivulet. Hence, 
I conceived it to be evident, that the action of light directly 
caused the green colour to be secreted in this sponge ; and 
for the sake of corroborating this opinion, I subsequently 
made these additional experiments. 

A short time afterwards, I fished up by means of a wire- 
gauze net fixed to the end of a rod, a large mass of the river 
sponge from the same rivulet ; this specimen was growing 



UPON THE COLOUR OF THE RIVER SPONGE. 261 

upon a stone ; it was somewhat lobed, but of a pale buff, or 
yellowish -brown, and not unlike, in colour, the common offi- 
cinal sponge when dry. It was entirely destitute of any 
green tint, and was taken by me from the bottom of the 
rivulet under the low and narrow arch of a small bridge, 
where, in truth, the rays of the sun could, even on a 
summer's day seldom or never penetrate. Having carried 
home this mass in a vessel of water, I immediately placed 
it in a basin of water, adding fresh daily, as I had done 
in the former experiment, and put the basin in a window 
facing the west, so that the sun might shine through the 
glass fully upon it : after a short period, I saw the extre- 
mities or tips of the lobes of the sponge begin to be slightly 
coloured, and in a few days I had the satisfaction of ob- 
serving the lobes to have received a distinct green, which 
gradually commenced spreading over the lower portions of 
the mass that were further apart from the direct and nearer 
influence of the light. It was consequently apparent, that 
the want of green colour in this mass proceeded from the 
absence of lights at least, of a sujfficient quantity of light, 
in the original spot, underneath the low and dark arch, where 
the specimen was found growing. (3) Another experiment will 
also establish the fact, that UgJd is requisite to increase the 
green colour already received by this substance ; namely, I 
procured a piece of greenish or very light-green sponge (4) 
attached to a small stone, which I immersed in a dish of 
water, and similarly placed it, as in the fonner experiments, 
before the brightest light in the same window : the colour 
continued to increase in intensity, until, at the end of three 
weeks, it had become of a beautiful and dark emerald green. 
Thus, then, from these observations, I think no doubt can 
be entertained, that light is absolutely necessary, not only to 
produce the green colouring matter in this kind of sponge, 
but likewise to increase the intensity of the green itself, in 
various degrees, in proportion as lii^more or less powerfully [5) 
acted upon by the addition of the sun's rays. 

Therefore the opinion advanced sometime since by Lamou- 
roux, can no longer be considered tenable ; " leur couleur^'' 
says that eminent zoophytist, " est un vert plus ou moins 
fonce, qui semble varier suivant la nature dti cot'ps auquel 
elles adherent'' (' Hist, des Polyp. Corall. Flex.,' p. 5). 

Now, the influence of light upon the colouring matter of 
this Spongilla, proved by the experiments shortly here de- 
tailed, will strike every botanist as being precisely analogous 
to the same cause, which effects the like phenomena, under 
similar circumstances, on the stems and lesives of plants ; 
and therefore, may have much weight in determining the true 



202 ON THE ACTION OF LIGHT 

nature of the river sponge. Every one knows tliat when it 
is necessary to blanch vegetables, they are carefully concealed 
from the light ; and when plants are grown in a dark place, 
they are of a delicate white, or yellowish-white, and perfectly 
devoid (6) of their natural green colour ; but which, on their 
being exposed to the light, soon becomes conspicuous, and 
after a short time the plants obtain their usual green. (7) So 
also, with most flowers and fruits, their colours are more or 
less bright and vivid, according as they are exposed to or 
concealed from the sun ; and I have sometimes noticed, that 
purple grapes (the Black Hamburgh, for instance), on being 
gathered and placed for a few days out of the light, in a dark 
closet, apparently lose somewhat of their deep and rich 
colour. I would, therefore, suggest that this remarkable and 
peculiar (8) property of light, which causes, as well as in- 
creases, the colours upon the several parts oi plants, might be 
appropriately termed, \he chromatic action of light. Whilst, 
on the contrary, from this action upon the colours of ani- 
mals, no such effect is known to occur ; for with them a very 
powerful light, such alone as is communicated by the most 
luminous rays of the sun, has merely the effect of darkening, 
or, as it is more commonly called, tanning the skin, and 
not of causing any distinctly bright or new colours to ap- 
pear. (9) Neither does any similarity herein exist (as far as I 
am aware) with regard to the low er animals, that more nearly 
approximate to plants, as the Animal-flowers, or Actiniae ; 
because, from much acquaintance with some of these singular 
creatures, both from having observed them in their native 
localities among the rocks of our sea shores, and from having 
often kept them alive in glasses, for the sake of attentively 
examining their structure and habits, I have never noticed 
any difference between the colours of those which inhabit 
deep holes underneath the rocks (10) about low-water mark, 
that are thickly covered with the dark sea-weeds [Fucus ser- 
ratus, and F. vesiculosus chiefly), and so concealed from the 
light, and of others which adhere upon the surface of the 
rocks, and are well exposed to the solar rays. Nor have I 
been able to ascertain that the green colour in the common 
green fresh-water Polype [Hydra viridis, Lin,) is ever found 
to vary, or to become more or less manifest, by admission to, or 
exclusion from, the light. (\l) But it would be superfluous to 
add any further examples of the same kind. 

Some naturalists, even at the present day, are doubtful 
respecting the real nature of the Spongilla, as well as of the 
other Spongiadce (if animals), or Spongiaceae (if plants), 
although the majority appear to decide in favour of their

auhnallty ; among those in the minority, I will mention a 
very able botanist and zoologist, Dr. George Johnston, who, 
in his essay on British Zoophytes, published in the " Maga- 
zine of Zoology and Botany," states his view of these pro- 
ductions in the following words : — " I cannot go the length of 
Ellis, in considering it proved that sponges belong to the 
same class {Zoophytes) ; Ellis, we have seen, knew that no 
polypes were to be found in sponges.". ..."Now, this fact, in 
my opinion, determines the point, for if they are not the pro- 
ductions of Polypes, the zoologist who retains them in his 
province, must contend that they are individually animals, 
an opinion to which I cannot assent, seeing that they have 
no animal structure, or individual organs, and exhibit 7io one 
function usually supposed to be characteristic of that king- 
dom. Like vegetables, they are permanently fixed ; like 
vegetables, they are non-irritable ; their movements, like those 
of vegetables, are extrinsical and involuntary ; like crypto- 
gamous vegetables, or Algce, they usually grow and ramify in 
forms determined by local circumstances ; and if they present 
some peculiarities in the mode of the imbibition of their 
food, and in their secretions, yet even in these they evince a 
nearer affinity to plants, than to any animal whatever." (12) 
This author, therefore, restores the sponges " to the Vegetable 
kingdom, to which the earlier naturalists (13) believed they had 
a rightful claim." (14) 

I will not here venture to give any express opinion, whe- 
ther the Spongilla be a vegetable or an animal production, 
but will merely notify, that after many repeated and careful 
observations I have hitherto entirely failed in perceiving any 
individual and decided marks of its animality ; though, on 
the contrary, the facts of the want and intensity oi ihe green 
colour, (15) as in plants, being caused by the absence SinA pre- 
sence of light, may afford strofig evidence that might be very 
fairly advanced more in favour of its being nearer allied to 
the Alg(B or Fungi, and so belonging to the vegetable king- 
dom. (16) Future observations will alone set at rest this du- 
bious question in Natural History. 

I am, however, most desirous that those naturalists who 
reside near the sea-coasts, would ascertain whether light 
does not cause .s^/?^^7«r effects on the colours (17) of the differ- 
ent marine sponges, which, indeed, seems to me extremely 
probable from the following statement : — " Je ne peux rien 
dire de certain," observes M. Lamouroux, " sur la couleur 
{des eponges), qui parait tres fugace et tres-variee ; d'apres 
les auteurs qui les ont observees vivantes, les nuances qu'elles 
presentent seraient nombreuses et brillantes ;" (18) and thus

would they afford other and not unimportant proofs, towards 
a certain knowledge of these remarkable substances, and of 
the true position which they occupy amongst the manifold 
works of Nature. 



NOTES. 

(1) This species is the Spongilla friahilis (Lamarck) ; 
Ephydatiajluviatilis ( Lamouroux) ; Halichondria fluviatilis 
(Fleming) ; and Spongia fluviatilis (Linnaeus). 

(2) Having, in the summer of 1838, finished another expe- 
riment on this head, I found, by placing some living speci- 
mens of the Spongilla of different shades of green, — one of 
which was a very deep green, — in a pan of water confined 
to the dark, that the green colour gradually decreased, and 
became much paler. I must also mention, that the colour 
underneath all those specimens whose upper surfaces were 
submitted to the full action of the light, continued to the 
last perfectly greenless, by reason of the deprivation of 
light. 

(3) I have lately repeated the same experiment with success. 
On March 20th, 1838, I obtained some small greenless spe- 
cimens of the Spongilla from under the same arch, and after 
the expiration of sixteen days, they had received a clear, 
though rather pale green colour. This change took place in 
the light of a window, at a season when the sun shone but 
little, and when its illuminating rays had only a small de- 
gree of power. I ought to state, that all the masses of river 
sponge, on which the above observations were made, were 
free from any moss, or other vegetable, by means of which 
the green colouring matter might, perhaps, be supposed to 
have been communicated to those specimens. 

(4) I will take this opportunity of making known, that I 
discovered in the summer of 1837 (August 24), among some of 
the before-mentioned specimens of this Spongilla, the little 
fresh-water Zoophyte called Tuhularia repens by Gmelin, 
Naisa repens, by Lamouroux, and Plumatella repens, by 
Lamarck. I am not aware that it has ever before been found 
in England, though Dr. Fleming gives the " Lochmill-loch, 
Fife," in Scotland, as a locality for it. The elegant crystal- 
line Polypes lived in great activity for several days. In 
March, 1838, I again found a mass of these Poly paries : at 
first, no Polypes were visible, and I, of course, fancied that 
they were dead ; after three or four days, when the mass had 
been placed in water in the window of a room in which there 
was a fire during half the day only, two or three Polypes

appeared, protruding themselves from the extremities of the 
tubes ; but at the end of a fortnight, or rather longer, to my 
surprise, the Polypes became extremely numerous, and exhi- 
bited themselves in full life ; thus showing that in the win- 
ter, or cold weather, these little animals are torpid or inactive, 
and keep entirely within their tubular dwellings ; but, on the 
return of spring, when the temperatures of the air and water 
are again sufficiently warm, they revive and become lively. 

(5) The green in this Spongilla being increased by the 
more powerful rays of light, as shown in the last-mentioned 
experiment, affords a case extremely analogous to the results 
of certain experiments made by Professor Daubeny on plants, 
and which are stated by him in these words : — " from a few 
experiments I have made on the secretion of green matter 
in the leaves, I should be led to infer, in contradiction to the 
results of Senebier, that the most luminous rays were most 
influential ; the orange glass, whose chemical influence was 
as four, whilst its illuminating power was as six, quickly im- 
parting to the primordial leaves of beans which had just ap- 
peared above ground, a bright green hue, whereas, under the 
ammonio- sulphate, whose illuminating power was as two, 
whilst its chemical influence was as five, they continued of 
a pale yellow, scarcely indeed of a shade darker than in ano- 
ther case where light was completely excluded. I have 
made some experiments, with similar results, on the colours 
of jiowers, the intensity or depth of which appeared, also, to 
depend on the brightness of the kind of light that had been 
allowed admission to them." Again, the Professor observes, 
— " Upon the whole, then, I am inclined to infer, from the 
general tenor of the experiments I have hitherto made, that 
both the exhalation and the absorption of moisture by plants, 
so far as they depend upon the influence of light, are affected 
in the greatest degree by the most luminous rays, and that 
all the functions of the vegetable economy, which are owing 
to the presence of this agent, follow, in that respect, the same 
law^ — (See Professor Daubeny's paper, " on the Action of 
Light upon Plants, &c." p. 158 and p. 163 in the Philoso- 
phical Transactions for 1835). 

(6) Captain Sir Edward Parry, in his North Polar voyages, 
used to raise quantities of mustard and cress in his cabin, in 
small shallow boxes filled with mould, and placed along the 
stove-pipe, for the purpose of giving a salad to the scorbutic 
patients, " the mustard and cress," he tells us, " thus raised, 
were necessarily colourless, from the privation of light ; but, 
as far as we could judge, they possessed the same pungent 
aromatic taste, as if grown under ordinary circumstances." — 
(p. 133, Parry's Journal of his first Voyage, 18*21.) 



2()() ON i'TlK ACTION OF LKiHl 

(7) I need not detail here the experiments by which I be- 
came convinced of the truth of the before-mentioned curious 
results. One case, indeed, did not occur to me to try ; but 
which is thus related by Dr. Daubeny : — " Professor De Can- 
dolle found that the leaves of plants placed in a cellar became 
green on exposure to a strong light from lamps ^ — (See 
'' Phil. Trans.,' 1835, p. 161.) Mr. N. B. Ward, F.L.S., has 
also kindly informed me, that from very recent experiments, 
he has ascertained that crocuses, grown in a dark situation, 
and submitted for about six hours every evening to the full 
influence of gas light, secreted in their leaves their usually 
bright green colour, and that the flower of one specimen 
received a pale blue. Another case I have commenced, but 
not as yet satisfactorily advanced; namely, how far the 
greenness in the leaves and other parts of vegetables at first 
grown in the light, is fugacious, and liable to lose its depth 
of colour on being afterwards excluded from the light, and 
confined to total darkness. 

(8) There can be no foundation, I think, for asserting that 
heat, independent of light, possesses the like chromatic ac- 
tion : because plants, when forced by artificial heat, but 
deprived of light, are not invested with their green colour ; 
and fruit, howsoever ripe it may be made by the high tem- 
perature of a stove or hothouse, if concealed from the light 
by many leaves, or in any other way, remains quite pale, and 
never receives its proper and full tints. The same thing 
likewise takes place with fruit, from which the light is exclu- 
4ed, when ripened by the heal of the sun. 

(9) With many animals which have variable fur or plumage, 
heat and cold, but not light, are the principal causes of their 
variations in colour. In support of these facts, consult my 
paper on the changes in the colour of the fur in the ermine, 
at p. 718, vol. 5, ' Magazine of Natural History;' and for 
Capt. Ross's very conclusive experiment on this subject, 
refer to Professor Bell's ' British Quadrupeds,' p. 153. 

(10) Notwithstanding that the Aclinic are endowed with 
the power of locomotion, I have watched some individuals 
continue fixed in the same crevices of rocks for many suc- 
cessive days, indeed, for a sufficient time to render any 
change in their colours quite conspicuous. 

(11) M. Trembley tried to communicate to the hrown Polgpe 
(Hydra fusca), a green tint. Not having any water insect 
of that colour, he had recourse to the green variety -of the 
rose louse [Aphis rosce ?) Several Polypes devoured some 
of those green lice, and after they had digested them, they 
received a faint colouring of greeii ; [vide Memoires pour 



UPON THE COLOUR OF THE RIVER SPONGE. 267 

rilist. des Polypes d'eaii douce, p. 128). Now, the same 
author has described the true cause of the changes in the 
colours of the freshwater Polypes, thus, " Apres avoir nourri 
pendant quelque tems des Polypes, j'eus lieu d'etre persuade, 
que cette variete de couleur venoit, non seulement du plus ou 
du moins de nourri ture que je donnois a ces animaux, mais 
aussi de la diversite de la couleur meme des alimens qu'ils 
prennoient." (p. 126). Also, " les grains, qui se trouvent en 
abondance dans la peau des Polypes, sont colores : c'est de 
leur couleur que depend celle des Polypes ; et la leur depend 
de celle du sue nourricier que ces animaux tirent des alimens 
qu'ils prennent. Ces grains deviennent, par exemple, rouges 
ou noirs, quand les Polypes ont ete nourris par un sue rouge 
ou noir. lis ont des nuances, plus ou moins fortes, de ces 
differentes couleurs, a proportion de la force de la nuance de 
celle du sue nourricier, et a proportion de sa quantite. En- 
fin, ils perdent peu-a-peu leur couleur, si on ne I'entretient, en 
donnant de tems en tems des alimens de meme couleur aux 
Polypes y (p. 131). And again, "II est tres-aise de remar- 
quer, que, lorsqu'un Polype a peu mange, et surtout lorsqu'il 
a jeiine, il n'y a que quelques couches de grains, savoir, les 
plus pres des parois de I'estomac, qui soient colorees : les 
autres sont blanches, et ferment cette enveloppe transparente, 
garnie de grains non-colores." (p. 132.) So, Dr. George 
Johnston writes of the Nereis viridis (Lin.), " when kept in 
a vessel of sea-water, deprived of food, the green colour be- 
comes less intense.''^ (* Annals Nat. Hist.,' vol. iv. p. 229). 

(12) See ' Mag. of Zoology and Botany,' vol. i. p. 229. 

(13) Linnaeus at first classed the Spongilla in his '^ Flora 
Lapponica' among the Cryptogamia Lithophyta ; then in 
his 'Flora Suecica' (edit. 1755), and ' Species Plantarum,' 
(edit. 1753), with the Cryptogamia AlgcB. 

(14) See * Magazine of Zoology and Botany,' p. 230. 

(15) It may, perhaps, be objected, that the Spongilla,heing 
either an animal, or else a group of animals, had imbibed 
for food certain green vegetable matter, and in accordance 
with the facts proved by M. Trembley (see his Memoir, 
p. 126 to p. 133), that the colours in the Hydras, or fresh- 
water Polypes, are caused by the substances they have swal- 
lowed and digested, — that this green colour was, conse- 
quently, derived from such vegetable matter ; but in the ex- 
periments before described, tt was impossible that this could 
have been the case ; because I carefully preserved the living 
sand-coloured specimens of the river sponge in a basin of 
pure and fresh pump-water, entirely apart from every vege- 
table substance, until they had received their full greenness 
from the solar light.

•2()H RKMAKKS ON THE 

(16) From a series of experiments, and some of them the 
same as those detailed in the preceding pages, which I have 
again undertaken upon several masses of the Spongilla since 
this paper vras communicated to the Royal Society, I am now- 
obliged to confess, that I have no doubt whatever regarding 
the vegetability of this kind oi freshwater sponge. 

(17) Chemistry will, I am sure, present us with some very 
good tests whereby to decide the vegetability or animality of 
the SpongicB marifKB ; and amongst other chemical re- 
searches to be hereafter instituted, the application of acids 
and alkalies to the colouring matter, or to the colours, when 
expressed from many species which exhibit the brightest and 
most brilliant tints, will tend, in a satisfactory manner, to- 
wards the solution of that doubtful point. 

(18) Vide 'Hist, des Polyp. Coral. Flex.,' p. 15. I find 
that even in the Mediterranean Sea, the colours of the differ- 
ent species of Spongia, when fresh and living, are exceedingly 
bright and numerous ; among them the following may be 
enumerated : — pale yellow, yellowish-white, white, red brown, 
dark brown, red wine, rose-grey, reddish, violet, blue, sul- 
phur, grey, yellow-grey, russet, pink or flesh-coloured, pur- 
ple, chestnut, reddish-white, saffron-yellow, orange, coral red, 
&c. See p. 371 — 380, tom. 5, * Hist. Nat. des Princip ales 
Productions de I'Europe Meridionale,' par A. Risso : Paris, 
1826. And it may be interesting to add, that green is also a 
colour observable in some of the sea sponges ; for example, 
in the Spongia urceolus, of Lamouroux.

(Continued from page 219.) 

For about six miles from its mouth, the St. John's presents 
on its shores little but snow-white sands, and dreary salt 
marshes. A few low huts, the houses of the pilots, a light- 
house, a hammock of dead trees,' a few starved-looking 
cows (you wonder what they live on), two or three miserable

palmettoes, their fronds all broken with the winds, are all 
that relieve the monotony of the scene. And is this Florida ? 
exclaims the traveller, who for the first time catches sight of 
her shores, his head filled with imaginings drawn from her 
name, and Bartram's strained description. Can this be Flo- 
rida } Was it here that Ponce de Leon sought the fountain 
that, like the cauldron of Medea, was to bring back youth ? 
Yes, this is East Florida, and the fountain of perpetual youth 
is to be found in its delicious atmosphere, w^hich revives the 
invalid, even on these barren sands. 

As you enter the river, however, you perceive two small 
islands in its channel, clothed with live-oaks, and fringed 
with lofty palmettoes, and beyond them, on the south side of 
the river, the steep wood-covered slope of St. John's Bluff, 
above which the river mostly runs between low wooded 
banks, with here and there other bluffs of small elevation. 
The highest, perhaps, of these bluffs, is St. John's, yet even 
that is not more than about eighty feet high. On the east 
it rises abruptly from the salt marshes, and is clothed with 
thick underwood, mingled with taller trees ; at the foot, is a 
small creek fringed on one side with bushes of a species of 
Lycium, and tall Yucccb. The northern side is nearly per- 
pendicular, for the tide washes it away at its base, and the 
sea-breeze, if, perchance, it blow stronger than common, 
scatters far and wide the sands of which it is composed. The 
vegetation on the summit, by slightly holding the earth toge- 
ther there, makes that part the last to fall : but during my 
stay, I was witness to the disappearance of more than one 
large tree from the undermining of its roots by the winds and 
waves. As is common in this part of the St. John's, beds of 
oyster-shells occur at various elevations ; they appear to be- 
long to the same species as the delicious ones which are as 
abundant at the mouth of the river in a living, as these in a 
dead, I can hardly say fossil, state, for they look just like the 
scattered shells we see in the roads and fields around our 
own habitations. On the summit of the bluff, especially 
near to the river, are a great many Indian mounds, the burial- 
places of a race, in all probability extinct before the white 
man set foot here. As the face of the bluff crumbles away, 
it exposes fragments of pottery, and sometimes bones, arrow- 
heads, and stone battle-axes from these tombs. The pottery 
is always in small fragments, rarely more than a few inches 
wide. These appear to be portions of large round vases, 
perhaps two feet in diameter. They are sometimes plain, 
sometimes reticulated on the outside with raised lines, and 
have evidently been subjected to intense heat. 



•270 REMARKS ON THK 

To the south there is a gentle slope to the open pine-bar- 
rens which extend in this direction beyond St. Augustine, 
and westward, the slope too is gradual, until the banks of 
the river are but little elevated above the water's edge. It 
was just w^here the level ground commences on this side of 
the blufi' that we made our home, in a large house originally 
built for a boarding-house, but then only tenanted by a w4- 
dow lady and two grandchildren, with the usual accompani- 
ment of a variety of negroes of all ages, w ho, however, lived 
in the yard close by. We were fortunate in obtaining an 
introduction to Mrs. Smith (such was the name of our excel- 
lent landlady), for nowhere else in East Florida could we have 
found so comfortable a home. At this time, south of Man- 
darin, there was no safety, a foe 

" Curst with each evil that pollutes, 
Mankind where least above the brutes, 
Without e'en savage virtue blest," 

had deluged the homes of the planters with blood : and the 
tomahawk, the scalping knife and the firebrand had again 
converted the shores of the St. John's into a wilderness. 
Mournful truly was it to ascend the St. John's. The cotton- 
grounds and the cane-fields were overgrown with thorny 
briars, the cattle wandered wild round the ruins of the dwel- 
lings of those who once w^ere their ow^ners ; here, a large 
black spot on the ground, a few" scattered fruit-trees, and per- 
haps some flowers, not indigenous, told that once the white 
man had dwelt where now nature reasserted her dominion ; 
there, the same story was more clearly told, by the ruins of 
some saw-mills, and the scattered fragments of the steam- 
engine rusting on the ground. 
St. Augustine, and that town 

" of hectors, 
Thieves, supercargoes, sharpers and directors," 

Jacksonville, were the only other places where we should 
have found any accommodation, and neither of these could 
be preferred to St. John's Bluff. We had comfort, and 
what w^as more, perfect freedom, for we had scarce any 
neighbours, there being only two or three little houses 
near. A small room up stairs w^as soon fitted up as our 
laboratory; our boxes, setting-boards, jars, and all such 
apparatus were ranged against the walls, which w^ere fur- 
ther adorned with an axe, a cutlass, a gun, and its accom- 
paniments of shot-belt, powder-horn and game-bag, and 
our insect nets. I selected this room, because on one 
side it commanded a view of the open western slope of the 
bluff, on the other, of the wooded hill at the back of the 



LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 271 

liousc ; and moreover had a door into a piazza, where I could 
sit and skin a bird, or fish, and watch the PeloiJaei building 
their clay nests. At the back of the house was a hill, or 
rather an elevated ridge of land, continued from the southern 
side of the bluff, and bordering the shore for a considerable 
distance, separating the low tract next the river from the 
pine-barrens behind. This was entirely a hammock, that is 
to say, originally a wood of other trees than pines. In Flo- 
rida, the term hammock lands is applied to lands that are or 
have been covered with hard-wooded trees, as oaks, sweet- 
gum, hickory, &c. ; the term pine-barren, of course, belongs 
to the low barren pine-covered tracts, though these are often 
not so barren as their name or appearance would lead us to 
believe ; swamps are generally distinguished as cypress- 
swamps, where the chief growth is Cupressus disticha and 
bay-galls ; where the growth is chiefly Lauri and Gordonice, 
the latter are mostly near to the rivers. At the back of the 
house, then, we had a hammock, composed of live oaks 
[Qiiercus virens), willow oaks (Querciis Phellos), and other 
species, hickory (Carya'^), chinquapin {Castanea pumila), 
sweet gum (Liquidamhar styracijiua), beneath which was 
an undergrowth of Olea Americana, Hopea tinctoria, Porce- 
lia jn/gmcea, Ptelea trifoliata, HamameUs Virginica, and a 
variety of beautiful Andromedce and Vaccinia, intermingled 
with sweet bays and other shrubs, and a few young or 
stunted plants of the tall palmetto. Bignonia capreolata, 
Lonicera sempervirens, and Gelseminmn nitidum were com- 
mon here ; Bignonia radicans was more rare. Amongst the 
bushes Cactus Opuntia abounded in every sunny spot; its 
large golden flowers were the favourite resort of Trichius 
piger "^ and one or two Lepturce. Flowers were not nume- 
rous here, though there were a few rather interesting species. 
I had omitted to mention the luxuriant vines of two or more 
species w^hich overspread the bushes, one species having 
flowers as fragrant as the mignionette of our gardens; neither 
have I said a word of the various species of Smilax annoy- 
ingly common here. 

There were various paths through this hammock, though 
many nearly grow^n up, but my cutlass soon opened these, 
and gave us a freer range. At the back of this hammock 
was a large pond, abounding in water lilies and other aqua- 
tic plants, especially a beautiful Eriocaulon. This pond 
abounded, too, in aquatic Coleoptera, especially in February, 
for after that month they became less numerous : dragon- 

* Not having- seen tlie fruit, I cannot say whicB species tliey were. 



272 REMARKS ON THE 

flies {America, "devil's darning-needles") were there in swarms 
in April and May. Frogs, too, there was no lack of, and 
noise enough they made in April, May and June. I used to 
think of a story 1 heard on ship-board. A fellow was boast- 
ing of the fertility of his lands on the Savannah river, they 
were so rich that they produced three hundred bushels to the 
acre. A bystander reminded him they were all a swamp ; 
" True," says the boaster, " and they'll produce you three 
hundred bushels of frogs to the acre, and alligators enough 
to make a rail fence round them." As to frogs, this pond was 
quite as productive. Beyond this pond all was one long 
space of open pine-barren, for I know not how far south. 
Occasionally swamps are to be met with, and one long line 
of swamp is known as the Tw^elve-mile Swamp, a name, the 
origin of which I do not know ; it can have no relation to 
its length, for it reaches to within six miles of the bluff, and 
in walking through the pine-barrens thirty miles further 
south between Picolata and Augustine, I had to cross it, and 
observed that it continued much further south. There are 
several large and small ponds in the pine-barrens, one, I 
should think covering above a hundred acres. The banks of 
this are full of holes of the large tortoise or Gopher {Testudo 
Carolina), looking like rabbit burrows. These pine-barrens 
are generally covered with dwarf palmettoes, ChamcBrops 
serrulata, and a low growth of Quercus pumila, and some 
other shrubs, amongst which Ceratiola ericoides is very con- 
spicuous from its heath-like appearance ; in fact, were it not 
that it is rarely to be seen without many of its two-seeded 
berries still adhering to the last year's shoots, it might easily 
be mistaken for a heath. There are a good many flowers 
scattered through these pine-barrens, the larger portion being 
Compositae ; but the custom of annually burning the grass 
destroys these as well as the insects, the seeds of the annuals 
being, in a great measure, burnt, and the growth of all others 
of course is injured. 

Westward from our dwelling, but separated by a little 
creek and a narrow strip of marsh, was a large plantation 
known as the Ship-yard, from a part of it having been once 
used for that purpose. The soil and general appearance of 
the surface was the same as at the bluff*, the former varying 
from all sand to a mixture of one part of vegetable mould 
with one of sand. Large tracts had been cleared here and 
neglected, and now were overrun with bushes of the Chick- 
asaw plum, dew-berries [Ruhus trivialis), whose pleasant 
fruit ripens in April, wild vines, various species of Smilax 
and Cactus Opuntia, or an allied species (for certainly here 



LEPinOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 273 

are more than one species of this genus in the southern 
states ; Elliott thought three), and a variety of other plants. 
These clearings were surrounded by hammocks, similar to the 
one I have previously described, but with many other trees 
and shrubs interspersed, as Magnolia grandiflora, Ciipressus 
thyoides, Aralia spinosa, Euonymus Americanus, Itea Vir- 
ginica, and a beautiful Andromeda {A. paniculata f Walt.) 
The tall palmetto, too, was abundant here, both as tall trees 
of fifty or sixty feet high, or in its younger state, with its 
fronds springing immediately from the ground, the only 
state in which I have ever seen it when growing far from the 
w^ater. 

In front of the house, and extending up to the western 
side of the summit of the bluff, is a strip of open ground. 
This is mostly covered with grass, but is here and there, in 
spring and summer, one entire mass of Passijlora carnea 
and Galactea Elliottii, and in one spot there was a large patch 
of Clitoria mariana, intermingled with Centrosema Virgin- 
iana : scattered 'fig-trees, orange trees and pomegranates, with 
here and there a bush of Melia Azedarach, give signs of a 
former cultivation, more extended than it now is, probably 
when the British held East Florida. Cactus Opiintia abounded 
here, and Erythrina herhacea shot up its long spikes of scar- 
let flowers fi-om the sides of the bushes of Xanthoxylum tri- 
car pum. 

Situated in about lat. 31° 35', of course, the climate of 
the bluff" must be mild. In January, we had the thermometer 
in the day-time, frequently up to between 60° and 70°; the 
violets, our own sweet violets, were in flower in the gardens, 
but beyond this there was little sign of vegetation making 
any progress, until the end of the month. On the first of 
February, we had the thennometer up to 69° at eight a.m., 
in the piazza on the north side of the house, open to the 
cool sea-breeze ; the plums were getting into flower, and the 
young leaves of Hamamelis virginica were bigger than a 
dollar; some species oi Smilax had young shoots above two 
feet long; Pinguicula pumila, Viola lanceolata, and a blue- 
flowered species, were in full bloom, and Vaccinium sta- 
mineum, and some of the Andromedce were coming into 
flower. This was followed by thunder showers, and on 
the 4th there was frost enough to brown slightly the young 
shoots of the orange trees. The weather then again be- 
came more warm, and on the 15th, the theraiometer in 
the piazza, at 8 a.m., was 69*", and at 2 p.m., 77°. Vege- 
tation now began to progress rapidly. The scarlet gros- 
beaks and mocking birds were paired ; numerous Lepidoptera 
and many Coleoptera, especially Telephori, came to my 



274 REMAllKS ON THE 

lamps, and spring seemed quite set in. But again vegeta- 
tion experienced a check, for early in the morning of the 
17th was a very slight frost, and once in the ensuing fort- 
night we had the thermometer as low as 41°, at 8 a.m. By 
the 1st of March the peaches were in full bloom, and then 
the bushes were hung with festoons of the fragi'ant golden 
flowers of Gelseminum niiidum. About this time, too, the 
black snakes and the alligators came forth from their winter 
quarters, and the river swarmed with brown pelicans [Peli- 
canus fuscus). Although during the next two weeks, the 
weather was sometimes rather cool, the thermometer once or 
twice being as low as 45°, and never above 70°, vegetation 
still progressed rapidly. Insects, as yet, were less numerous 
than I had anticipated, and the frequent rains limited my 
hunting excursions. The swamps, hitherto tolerably dry, 
were now quite impracticable, the ponds overflowed their 
banks, and the low grounds in the pine-barrens were all un- 
der water. 

After the vernal equinox, the weather was beautiful during 
the remainder of our stay in Florida, that is, until the 15th 
of June, although, during May, vegetation suffered from 
drought. February and March had been wetter and colder 
than usual ; April, May, and June, though not warmer than 
common, were much drier, and the cotton and Indian corn 
suffered considerably. Occasionally we had a cold day, but 
they were not frequent. Once in April I observed the ther- 
mometer as low as 51°, and once in May, 58°. The general 
temperature of April was from 60° to 70° at 8 a.m., and 75° 
to 84° at 2 P.M. In general the nights were warm; I observed 
the thermometer more than once at 74° between midnight 
and 3 a.m., my common bed-time, when there was no moon. 
The thermometer, generally, gradually sunk from sunset until 
sun-rise, then rose again until 2 p.m., unless the sea-breeze 
blew strong, for then, sometimes, it was cooler at that time 
than at eight or ten o'clock in the morning. Exposed on the 
sands to both the sun and the sea-breeze, the thermometer 
often rose to 124°. In May and June we often had the ther- 
mometer at 78° at 8 a.m., and 88° at 2 p.m. Nothing could 
be more luxurious than this weather, especially for an ento- 
mologist. The plan I generally followed was to rise about 
six, to spend an hour spreading the last night's captures, 
breakfast at seven, start at once for a walk till two, then 
spend an hour in ablutions for the sake of health, and rub- 
bing myself with oil to kill the betes-rouges, which swarm in 
some parts of the hammocks ; take a short siesta after din- 
ner, and then a short walk, until sunset brought on dark- 
ness without the intervention of twilight ; and then, after an 



LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 275 

evening meal, light my lamps to attract moths, and sit dovvn 
to spread insects, or press plants, always till after midnight, 
sometimes until the rosy-fingered goddess showed herself in 
the east, when, from a couple to four hours of sleep, made 
me ready to begin a new day. Reader, if ever it should be 
thine to reside in a hot climate, never neglect two things ; 
the one to take plenty of exercise, regardless of the heat of 
noon, but regardful of chill night dews ; the other, to take 
great care of thy skin, for the moment perspiration is stopped 
fever begins. Ill health I never knew in East Florida, until 
lameness hindered me for some days from taking long walks ; 
want of exercise then brought on lassitude and debility. 

Coleoptera were now getting more numerous. Of the Ci- 
cindel(B, the earliest was Cic. unicolor, Dej., which, though 
found in almost all the pathways distant from the river, was 
still a rather rare insect. This was followed by Cic tortuosa, 
Dej., Cic. punctulata, Fab., and Cic. marginata^ Fab., all 
mostly frequenting the shores of the river, especially the mud 
left bare at low water. Further from the shore the beautiful 
Cic, ahdominalis, Fab., made its appearance in June, and 
then, too, Cic. doisalis, Say., [Cic. signata, Dej.), was very 
abundant at the mouth of the river. Under the fallen trees, 
or any scattered boards (stones there are none) you would 
find Pasimachi, Galeritce, Chlcenii, Scarites suhterraneus, 
Harpalus bicolor^ Clivina croiata, and other allied insects. 
Beneath the bark of the pine stumps, Anchomenus decor us, 
Alaus myops, and sometimes Al. oculatus, a good many He- 
teromera and not a few scorpions were to be found ; and in 
the decaying stumps of the water-oak, many species of Te- 
nehrionid<B were common, though less numerous than they 
had been in the winter months. On the brush-wood 
various Telephori, Digraphoi, Dictyopteri, Elateridw, Cur- 
culionidce, and ChrysomelidcB were now to be found. On the 
flowers of the dwarf oaks we took two or three species of 
Hijdnocera and some beautiful Cryptocepali ; ^ on those of the 
farkleberry [Vaccinium arhoreum) several small Lehice (as 
Leh. tricolor, vittata, viridis, pulchella), the pretty Trichius 
viridultis, and the equally pretty but more rare Trichius lunu- 
latus. Cetoni(B too appeared; two species in great abun- 
dance, Cetonia hrunnea, Dej. [ScarabcBus Indus, Lin.), and 
Cetonia sepulcliralis, the latter in various flowers, the former 
flying over the pathways. The palmetto flowers were the fa- 
vourite haunts of Trichius Delta. During our whole stay in 
East Florida I had adopted my old plan of illuminating our

270 REMARKS ON THE 

windows, except on evenings when there was much moonlight, 
for then it was useless, and then I loved to sit in the piazza 
and look out over the broad calm river, to listen to the hoarse 
roar of the alligators, the loud drumming of the drum-fish, 
the croaking of the frogs, the loud plaint of the whip-poor- 
will, or the music of the mocking-bird. Beautiful, most beau- 
tiful were those calm clear nights, when the moon, almost 
vertical, hung like a silver globe beneath the dark blue sky, 
which, studded with a few bright stars, seemed to lie far be- 
yond her. To me these evenings seemed to tell more clearly 
than the days that I was far from home ; whatever sound we 
heard, whether it was the plaint of the whip-poor-will, or the 
alligator's roar, or whether it was the gay songs of the ne- 
groes as they paddled by in their canoes : whatever object 
the moon revealed to us, all was unlike to what we could see 
and hear in our native land, and over everything visible was 
poured forth a flood of light so beautiful, — but words cannot 
describe it, and 1 am digressing, and must " try back," as the 
Florida phrase is. 

It was during the period I have now been speaking of, that 
my evening and nocturnal labours were most successful ; in 
the early part of the time in Lepidoptera, later, in Coleoptera. 
The latter sometimes came in great numbers, and on those 
nights the Lepidoptera all stayed away. I might try to lure 
them from the woods, but they would not come when I called 
them. The Coleoptera which chiefly came, were one or two 
Lehim, Omophron Lecontei, PanagcBus fasciatus, one or two 
AncJiomeni, Harpalus hicolor, various Selenophori, Melo- 
lonthcB hirticida, va7'ians,frondicola, Say, and other species. 
Cyclocephala immaculata, Serica sericea, and other of their 
allies, a few Elateridae, Enoplium marginatum, Say, and one 
or two other species : various Telephori, Eupariiis luguhris, 
lunatus and coronatus, Monohammus dentator, Cerasphorus 
ga7'ganicus, Elaphidion mucronatum and put at or, Lamia Al- 
pha, Acanthocinus obsoletus and other longicoms, amongst 
which were some interesting new species. Occasionally, too, 
a host of Cicindel(B would pay me a visit, a circumstance I 
was at a loss to account for, until I found that they were all 
labouring under hydrophobia, brought on by the passing of 
a steam-boat, or the rise of the tide. De Coleopteris satis 
dictum est. 

Orthoptera and Neiiroptera, too, were getting pretty nume- 
rous ; for the fonner, however, the autumn is the best season. 
The curious genus Mantispa appeared in April and May, 
when Man. hrunnea was not unfrequently to be found on the 
bushes of Baccharis and Lycium, near the shore. A few 



LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 277 

MantidcB came to my lamps. Hymenoptera, in June, began 
to abound. Previously, numerous bees had been out, but in 
June the space in front of the house swarmed with various 
species of Scolia, Bemhex^ Mutilla^ 8^c., but of these it will 
be spoken elsewhere. Hemiptera were not numerous, nei- 
ther did I meet with so many of peculiar forms as I had hoped. 
The Diptera I would gladly say nothing about, for I love 
East Florida dearly ; I don't like to say anything to her dis- 
credit ; but alas ! I can't do otherwise than tell the truth, the 
whole truth, and nothing but the truth. There are, in East 
Florida, musquitoes enough to teach the whole world, as Sam 
Slick has it, the moral of feeling, and not only this world, but 
another or two besides, and if the 'squetoes would not do it, 
the sandflies would, and if the sandflies would not, the Ta- 
banid(B would. 1 once ran a thorn of Cactus Opuntia through 
my boot into my ancle, and broke it off* below the skin. I 
I could not extract the barbed point, and so was lame for a 
few days, and had to go about in low shoes. I fancied the 
musquitoes had been busy one day at my foot, above the 
shoe, so set to work to count the bites. There were marks of 
nearly five dozen bites on my ancles and instep, all swelled 
up as big as peas. When collecting in the vicinity of the 
swamps and ponds, hands, face, and neck came in for an 
equal share of bites : the very time occupied in pinning an 
insect enables a dozen to have a fair chance at you. Upon 
the principle laid down by Lucretius, in his second book 
concerning the nature of things,^ it may not be uninteresting 
to the English entomologist to know that there is a vast va- 
riety in the sensations caused by the bites of various species 
of musquitoes. There is a red fellow like our Ciilex rufiis, 
and another, like our C. anmilatus, that bite pretty sharp, 
but don't cause much pain, itching or swelling afterwards ; 
there is another fellow, with pearly white wings, and semi- 
transparent body and legs, that goes to work upon you so 
gently that you don't perceive it, but ends in getting such a 
meal at your expense, that he can hardly fly off" with it ; 
you know some twelve hours after where he got it from, and 
won't forget for a couple of days. Then there is a brown 
fellow who torments you both now and hereafter ; I mean 
that his bite is very sharp, and that it leaves a good-sized 
swelling to plague you for three days ; and if you rub it you 



' Suave, mari magno lurLantibus aequora ventis, 
E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem :

Sed quihus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est. 



278 ItHMARKS ON THE 

iiuikc a sore that will teaze you for a long time. Your true 
luusquitoes, when they alight on you, don't begin to bite at 
once, but sit down and feel your skin with their beaks, and 
lift up a leg and put it down again, with sundry other ma- 
noeuvres, and then commence operations : but there are some 
species who come at you with the beak stretched out, as if 
charging with a bayonet, and fairly have it in your skin ere 
they alight ; these are gallynippers. Satis de Culicihus die- 
turn est. 

Next to the musquitoes in rank, as annoyances, come the 
Tahanidce. First, there are two or three species of Chrysops, 
of which you may have a hundred round your head waiting 
for a chance to bleed you : then you have the true bred Ta- 
haniy some as big as the last joint of your thumb ; there 
can be no need of leeches where they are. Last come the 
sand-flies, a most intolerable pest near the shore, and there 
only. I don't know the genus, they are little fellows, very 
like our Ceratopogones, but possibly are Simulia, though 
much smaller than our British species. Near the river they 
are in millions, and creep into your hair, whiskers, eye-brows, 
and if you have silk or cotton gloves, put their heads in be- 
tween the threads, and bite pretty smart, though not so very 
bad, if they did not come at you by hundreds at a time. Such 
are the troubles of an insect-collector in East Florida ; trou- 
bles, however, he soon gets used to, and ceases to care about. 

Much more remains to be said of the Diptera, much has 
been passed over of interest in the other orders ; but already 
I have made too long an introduction to my paper, and it is 
more than time that I began the real subject of it. Gentle 
reader, if so be that thou art gentle, as I hope thou art, par- 
don the tediousness of much that has been written. No 
doubt thou hast read in Gil Bias what made the Archbishop 
of Grenada's homilies more tedious than usual ; a similar 
cause has made this introduction what it is. For the future, 
JDios te tibre, lector, de Prologos largos, y de malos Epitetos. 

On the 15th of June, we bade adieu to our excellent landlady 
and her household, not forgetting all the negroes (for your 
southern slaveholder, even, if leaving home for a long time, 
shakes hands with his domestic slaves), and left Florida a 
day or two afterwards. Our course northward lay through 
the beautiful sea islands on the coast of Georgia. 

These islands produce the valuable sea-island cotton, and 
are well cultivated in their interior ; their shores are in gene- 
ral beautifully fringed with woods, though here and there is 
a portion of salt marsh. But the voyage between them is 
truly delightful, not only for the beauty of the scenery, but 



LEPIDOPTERA OF NORTH AMERICA. 279 

the picture of happy labour it presents. It would be hard 
to find an equal in beauty to the zone of vegetation that 
surrounds them, or a more enlivening scene of labour. By 
the side of the lofty cone of the magnolia, displaying her snowy 
blossoms to the breezes which waft their fragrance afar, shoots 
up the tall stem of the palmetto, crowned with its vast fan- 
like fronds ; the dark foliage of the cypress and pine are in- 
termixed with the delicate green of the water-oak, or the 
liquidambar ; the live oak spreads forth its crooked arms, all 
hung with long grey tresses of Tillandsia, over the thickets 
of BumelicB, Hopea, Lauri, Andromedce, Vaccinia, with 
snow-white blossoms; Myrica, Olea, Glycine, and countless 
other shrubs, interwoven w^ith scarlet-flowered honeysuckles, 
grape-vines with fragrant flowers, and the two Bignoniai, 
their flexible branches ascending the tallest oaks, and hang- 
ing with flowery wreaths their rugged arms. From this mass 
of foliage and flowers the mocking bird pours forth his ever- 
varied lay ; the scarlet grosbeak, his humbler but melodious 
notes ; and the little ground-doves complain in mournful tones. 
High above soar the vultures, mere moving dark spots on the 
deep blue sky, and bright as silver glistens the white head 
of the bald eagle, as he wheels in wide circles keeping watch 
over the fish -hawk, seated on the dead branch of a pine. 
Here a sturgeon leaps, or a porpoise blows, there an alligator 
floats like a log on the surface of the water, or basks ex- 
tended in the sun. Swift from some little cove darts forth a 
light boat, manned by some half-dozen negroes, with faces 
looking happy as a schoolboy's on a holiday ; their oars keep 
time to their songs in praise of their boat and their master. 
From behind the bushes burst forth the sound of loud laugh- 
ter, or gay voices, perhaps, echoing back the chorus of the 
sable crew of the boat. An opening through tlie leafy screen 
at the bottom of the cove whence the boat came, discloses 
the interior of the island, showing wide-spread cotton fields, 
the mansions of the planters, the little towns of negro- 
houses, half buried in trees, and the cheerful gangs of la- 
bourers (must I say slaves ?) whose merry voices have been 
heard before. At the boat-landing, groups of little negro- 
children, perhaps, too, there are many white children mingled 
with them, are playing on the sands, or angling in the clear 
wave, and here and there an old superannuated negro is en- 
joying the sunshine, or aiding the young ones in their sport. 
The scene is one of beauty, life, and happiness. Such are 
the shores of Georgia. From Savannah we proceeded to 
Augusta, thence to the Warm Springs in North Carolina, and 
so northward and eastward to New York. After spending a 



280 ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 

few days near the clear blue waters of the Horicon, I pro- 
ceeded to Boston in order to spend a few days near Dr. Har- 
ris. I knew that from an American I could expect nothing 
but candour and kindness, for it is the grand characteristic of 
the nation. But much as I had expected, what I met with 
far exceeded my expectations. It would take up too much 
space, were I to enter into a detail of all the claims that Dr. 
Harris has on my esteem and gratitude ; but I cannot let an 
opportunity pass by without testifying to his unostentatious 
kindness and liberality. Cabinets, books, and manuscripts, 
were all thrown open to me. His collections, entomological 
books, &c., were in two rooms in the college buildings. A 
duplicate key given to me, enabled me to gain access at 
any hour. But enough. May the day nev^er come when I 
shall cease with grateful heart to honor and esteem him. 
Long may he live the first trans-atlantic Entomologist !

Art. IV". — Remarks on the Theory of Spontaneous Generation. 
By Mr. J. B. Bladon. 

In your January number. Dr. Weissenbom endeavours to 
argue from the Flora of the snow formation, the possibility 
of spontaneous generation ; but as it often happens with 
controversies upon cause and effect, the same fact may be 
wrested to support both sides of the question. He assumes a 
spontaneous origin to the plants of the snow formations, 
without assigning any reason whatever for it. We know 
that animal life can exist when the body is not only exposed 
to cold far below the freezing point, but some of the cold- 
blooded invertehrata of the arctic regions, may be frozen, 
thawed, and re-frozen, several times successively, and yet 
without life becoming extinct. Surely he does not mean to 
intimate that the cold and barren state of those places is 
incompatible with animal or vegetable reproduction ; but 
that it still possesses vigour sufiicient to produce the vital 
principle of vegetable organisms. It is well known that 
there are vegetable organisms peculiar to water in its fluid 
state, without contact with any earthy substance whatever ; 
and that also there are others peculiar to places where the 
atmosphere is fully charged with it in the state of vapour, 



ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 281 

only requiring a resting-place where they may be subject to 
its influence : then, what reason is there that we should deny 
organisms to it in its solid state ? It is still composed essen- 
tially of the same substances as in its other states : I say 
essentially, because in its fluid, or other states, it is often 
contaminated by other extrinsic substances, which may form 
a pabulum for some peculiar organism, which can only exist 
when such contamination takes place. What reason then 
can be assigned that we should assert immediately a vege- 
table organism appears upon it when in the sohd state, that 
this owes its existence to spontaneous generation ? It is not 
positively shown that they were without seeds or genus, al- 
though it may be admitted that these were not observable ; 
the reproduction of fungi is at present in such a state of 
obscurity, that it would be extremely difficult for any botanist 
to determine what are the germs in numberless species ; were 
the /ungi of the glacier proved to be germ less, — that they did 
notpossess the faculty of reproduction, — then there would be 
a resting-place or foundation for the doctrine. 

By the Doctor's manner of reasoning, when we find an 
unknown organism in a situation where we expected to find 
none, or observe a well-known one in an unusual habitat, 
or at a considerable distance Irom its other known localities, 
we are directly to ascribe a spontaneous generation to it; 
surely this is a most unphilosophical mode of disposing of 
the question, as direct a cutting of the Gordian knot as the 
most dogmatical assertion of the contrary doctrine could pos- 
sibly be. This is flying in the face of his own rule, which 
is the only safe foundation for us to proceed upon ; let us, in 
all disputed cases, leave ourselves open to conviction, and 
search out for the truth with unbiassed minds, or at least 
with a determination to avoid preconceived opinions, and to 
take every fact into consideration, with its proper deductions, 
and not to strain it, and by a tortuous mode of reasoning, try 
to put a false construction upon it. There are very few, if any, 
facts taken in support of the doctrine of equivocal genera- 
tion, but what may as equally (and perhaps as justly) be used 
to support the contrary opinion ; for it is not the obvious 
appearance of the organisms, whether vegetable or animal, 
that is disputed, but the cause of their appearance. A known 
organism appears in some unusual place, from its previously 
known habitats, or an unknown one is obsened in some 
locality never as yet minutely examined, or at least not made 
known that it has been examined ; the advocates of sponta- 
neous generation immediately say, that our doctrine is the 
right one, is plainly evident, because here an organism has 



282 ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 

appeared, which cannot be accounted for otherwise. Is as- 
sertion to take the place of positive facts, and is not this 
mere assertion ? Plow can we jwove that there were no germs 
of that type of organisms in that place where we now ob- 
serve the organism in question ? We find, when we begin to 
examine it, that it produces germs itself; then, by what parity 
of reasoning can we assert, that it has spmng from matter 
without any previous germ, when we find, in every succeeding 
instance, a germ is always given for a succeeding organism ? 

Philosophers are too much in the habit of considering 
themselves bound to assign a cause for every extraordinary 
proceeding in nature, as soon as observed, instead of candidly 
confessing their ignorance upon the subject, as though it 
would disgrace them to own that there were some subjects 
on which they possessed no more knowledge than the most 
unlearned. What ridiculous theories we should have been 
spared the pain of observing attached to respectable names, 
had they acted as above ; but instead of proceeding upon 
experiments and facts, and adapting their superstructure to 
the knowledge so obtained, they boldly assume a position, 
propound a theory in accordance with it, and then strive to 
support it by placing the most favourable observatioais in 
direct support, and wresting the unfavourable ones from their 
legitimate bearings and deduction to support it. This has 
happened with the advocates of many doctrines, and in 
nearly every branch of natural science. 

I can as easily believe that spontaneous generation can 
produce the largest, or the most complex organism, as that 
it can produce the smallest, or the most simple. Why should 
the operation of it be confined in general to the lower grades 
of organisms, both animal and vegetable, by the advocates 
of it, but solely because they know that they are unable to 
bring the slightest reason (much less fact) in support of 
their doctrine ? If they apply it to the larger, the universal 
experience of all mankind is against them. It is an idea com- 
monly held by many of the most ignorant and illiterate per 
sons, that Pediculi are generated spontaneously owing to an 
ill habit of body ; and I have known instances where the 
appearance of a single specimen of Fed. vestiamenti {P. 
corporis Immarti, Weiss.), would throw a whole family into the 
greatest inquietude, being regarded as the precursor of se- 
vere bodily illness, or trouble in worldly affairs. With regard 
to the statement of cleanliness preventing the operation of 
spontaneous generation in producing the various species of 
Pediculi, I can easily understand how cleanliness may re- 
move them after generation ; but I must confess my obtuse- 



ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 283 

ness in not being able to comprehend how cleanliness pre- 
vents spontaneous generation from producing them. I may 
safely appeal to the daily experience of hundreds, who, for 
long periods of time, have used no other modes of preven- 
tion than merely combing their hair with a common comb, 
without ever being infested by Ped. capitis. What prevents 
spontaneous generation from taking place in such cases ? 
They are subject to the same influence as others ; whatever 
secretions are produced, there they remain, subject to their 
power and influence, yet none are generated ; but if, by some 
chance, they should come in sufficient contact with an in- 
fested person, so that they might receive some from him, they 
will then live and multiply as favourably as if the person 
had been subject to them for years. ^ 

In respect to banishing the " uncouth idea of a Deus ex 
machind^'' so much insisted on by Dr. W., I think the argu- 
ments adduced by him are not very effective for that purpose; 
the utmost they do is merely to remove it a step further. If 
the vital principle is inseparably connected with matter, the 
varied purposes, actions, and operations of that principle, in 
all the varied forms of organic beings, must have been fore- 
seen by the Almighty; and powers suitable to those purposes 
have been implanted either in the different combinations of 
matter, or have endowed this unknown dynamic power with 
those peculiar powers, by the direct operation or command 
of the Deity, which then brings him into as direct operation 
in creating this complex unknown power, as a means of 
working out his intentions with respect to the created world 
and its inhabiting beings, as the common opinion does, which 
is the more simplified manner of action ; his omniscience is 
called into exercise equally as much, whichever opinion we 
adopt ; he knows the forms best suited for each purpose or 
locality, and whether he, by his direct word, called the types 
of all organisms into existence, or created a power which 
should perform the creations of those forms according as he 
saw best and most fitting, his omnipotent or almighty power 
is equally called forth. But to proceed (as I intend to return 
to this part of the subject further on), if we consider life 
solely by its effects, it is certainly a dynamic power, exhibit- 
ing results accomplished by no other power- whatever ; but 
with regard to its operations upon matter alone, as exhibited 
to our general view, we have nothing to do in our present 

' I have pursued this view of the subject much farther in the ' Entomo- 
logical Magazine' for April, 1837, in controverting the opinions of Biir- 
meister upon Phthiriasis, 6cc., as expressed in his ' Manual of Entomology,' 
§§ 202, 203.

enquiry : our object is simply to ascertain, as far as we pos- 
sibly can, whence life originates as we see it in operation in 
a living organism as to its primary origin. I believe there 
are but very few persons who object to ascribing it to a 
Supreme Being, and as one of the works that bears the im- 
press of an Almighty Creator, the most visibly to the mate- 
rial eye of man. Our question is, do living organisms always 
receive their vital or living principle from a typical predeces- 
sor, or do they ever receive it from a universal dynamic 
power acting upon matter, without typical predecessors ^ 

Spontaneous generation, when divested of all circumlocu- 
tion and long array of words, amounts simply to one of the 
two following theorems, if I may be permitted to adopt a 
mathematical expression. 

1st. That life is an inseparable attendant upon matter. 

2nd. That a principal attribute of matter is life ; for firstly, 
matter has only to be exhibited under different modifications 
to the influence of the unknown dynamic power to produce 
all the different modifications of organisms (living or extinct), 
the less variation causing the difference of species, and con- 
sequently the greater ones, the genera, families, orders, and 
classes ; or secondly, all organisms are created by sponta- 
neous generation "from the reaction of different kinds of 
matter upon each other, in consequence of the inherent 
qualities and power with which they were invested through 
the omnipresence of the Creator." In the foregoing quota- 
tion. Dr. W. either has alluded to a different attribute of the 
Supreme Being from what he intended by the tenor of his 
essay, or otherwise, he controverts his own arguments re- 
specting God as the acting Creator. I should suppose he 
meant to allude to the omniscience and omnipotence of God 
in investing matter with the qualities he speaks of; if he 
really alludes to the omnipresence of the Creator, at the 
arrangement of matter previously to the commencement of 
the life of every organism, this is bringing a direct interfer- 
ence of the Creator in every individual instance of the pro- 
duction of an organism, which is a more " uncouth idea " of 
the working Creator than the commonly received opinion of 
the Deity calling every typical form of organic being into 
existence at the creation, by his own word alone. 

If we admit, for argument's sake, the possibility of a univer- 
sally distributed dynamic power that has the power of giving 
life and individuality to organisms, we shall be driven to 
adopt the hypothesis of the Archeus, or Spii'itus mmidi of 
former ages, to direct and controul its operations. If we view 
it as a principle or power incident to matter, something

analogous to the electro-galvanic fluid, how are we to account 
for its varied results in the different classes of organisms, so 
as to give such extremely different powers of vital chemistry 
(if I may be permitted the use of the expression), that it 
shall endow one race of organisms with the faculty of secret- 
ing a combination of matter sought for in vain in every other 
race of organic beings, or in any combination of unorganized 
matter found upon the earth, and past the art of man so to 
combine matter to produce the same results, even although 
he knows all its constituents and the proportion in which 
they are combined, — that two insects shall be hatched, feed, 
and come to maturity upon the same plant, yet each of them 
shall so secrete matter, that it shall be utterly in vain to find 
the least trace of the peculiar product of the one in the other, 
although they have been subject to the influence of the same 
matter externally and internally. There surely must be a 
something beyond the mere effect of matter operated upon 
by any single power attached to it ; it is rather difficult to 
comprehend the idea of one and the same purely dynamic 
(consequently unintelligent) power, creating by its operations 
alone upwards of a million different species of organisms, 
endowing each with different powers fi-om all the rest, giving 
each the everduring faculty of reproduction of its kind, so 
that its descendants may never deviate from its type. 

If the powers of life are inherent in matter, and invested 
in or with it by the Almighty, how are we to account for the 
extinction of races of organic beings ? If we allow that man 
can cany on a war of extermination against a species of 
beings, what prevents spontaneous generation in such cases ? 
Are we to allow that one organism possesses the power of 
utterly eradicating another organism, notwithstanding the 
inherent powers of matter by which they are both produced ; 
— that man is more mighty than his Maker ; — that spon- 
taneous generation can create a power more powerful than 
itself.'' What absurdities we are liable to be led into when 
we overstep the plain boundaries of observed truth ! If 
we are so far distant from the great creative period of the 
present world, as to expect no new forms of organisms, what 
prevents it from reproducing the present or extinct forms ? 
Are we to conclude that it lies dormant as to one race of 
organisms, and in full operation as regards another ; or that 
it is so far exhausted, that it is not able to produce the 
higher organisms ? If so, it must, in time, become utterly 
exhausted and extinct, unless, by the direct interference of 
the Creator, it is renovated or renewed ; if it is not weak- 
ened, it must necessarily produce the very same forms of 
beings that it already has produced unless the combina- 



286 ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 

tions of matter vary, in which case the organisms produced 
must vary, which would, consequently, be new typical forms ; 
or lastly, we must conclude that there must be combinations 
of matter, not susceptible of its influence, which would de- 
stroy the doctrines of the inherent qualities of matter. 

A serious objection against the admission of the doctrine 
of spontaneous generation, whether as explained by Dr. 
Weissenborn,orbyBunneister,inhis ^Manual of Entomology' 
(who only allows spontaneous generation to act upon the 
secretions rejected by the vital principle of an organism), 
is the individuality of the organisms produced by its opera- 
tions. What power is there to regulate its actions upon the 
matter exposed to it ? When a dynamic power of any kind 
acts upon matter, it acts upon the whole mass exposed, and 
not upon the most minute portions of it alone ; therefore this 
presumed dynamic power, when in action, must animate the 
whole mass of matter exposed, whether great or small. If 
the mass in question is more than enough to furnish one 
germ or organism, what power regulates it, that it shall only 
create them of the size wanted, and that it shall not create a 
larger one ? Is it capable of dividing the matter, of knowing 
how much is required for each organism ? There must be 
some superintending power in attendance upon it, to prevent 
the confusion that must necessarily operate in producing 
germs of the same species of every conceivable size, from 
the most minute to the largest, according to the size of the 
varied collection of matter subjected to its influence ; or are 
we to believe that matter always assembles of itself in one 
determinate quantity according as it is required by this un- 
known power ? If, by its power, it creates such quantities 
of Pediculi, that a sick person's head is " covei'ed^'' with 
them ''at once^"* with adults, not with germs ; if there was 
such a quantity of disposable matter at hand, it must have 
been distributed in quantities of various sizes. I should 
very much like to be informed, how, in such a case, the mat- 
ter was regulated, so that there should be no overplus in one 
place nor any deficiency in another, if the currents of the pow- 
er were all in a state of equal tension or density, so as to give 
an equal proportion of vital power to every atom of the mat- 
ter exposed ; and if so, what power divides the living mat- 
ter into the proper quantities for each insect ? Might we 
not rather suppose that it would create one organism of each 
separate quantity of matter ? That would be most in ac- 
cordance with every observed action of every known dynamic 
power.

DESCRIPTIONS OF NEW CHITONS. 287 



Art. V. — Descriptions of some new Chitons. By Mr. G. B. 
SowERBY, Jun. 

Sir, 

Having lately examined the principal collections of shells, for 
the purpose of making a revised list of the species of the genus Chiton^ 
I have met with the following which I am unable to refer to described 
species. As this genus is one of great interest, I am desirous of making 
the new species known by their publication in the ' Magazine of Natural 
History,' and I have, therefore, drawn up the accompanying descriptions, 
with drawings of such of them as appear to me most worthy of illustra- 
tion.*

Differing from Ch. spinosus, in the number and length of 
the spines, as well as in the sculpture of the valves, this 
species forms a pretty addition to the thorny -margined sec- 
tion of Chitons. It is rather flat, oval, narrowed in front ; 
the valves are rounded and smooth at the beaks, and granu- 
lated at the sides, in undulating, concentric ridges ; an in- 
distinct beaded rib met by strioi at acute angles, separates 
the lateral fi'om the dorsal areas ; the numerous short black 
spines studding the margin, are tipped with light yellow 
points, which afford a pretty relief to the general black co- 
lour of the shell.

This species differs from Ch. limaciformis in being 
strongly ribbed, and from Ch. retusus, in not being fascicu- 
lated. It is elongated and narrow, with strongly relieved 
lateral areas, as in both those species ; it is strongly pecti- 
nated ; the valves are obtuse, and lean towards the posterior 
extremity, the apex of the last valve being nearly terminal. 
The margin is narrow, and covered with short blunt spines.

smooth, rather flat, tapering towards each extremity ; the 
valves are slightly beaked, the first radiated, the last with a 
terminal apex. A very slight rib separates the lateral from 
the central areas. The ground colour is light green, varied 
with brown, and a broad central w^hite line. A variety oc-

I am not acquainted with the margin of this species, but 
from analogy, am inclined to think that it is scaly. The 
shell is regularly oval, rather flat, smooth, rounded in the 
centre, the lateral and terminal areas rather elevated, radiately 
grooved ; the posterior edges of the valves denticulated, the 
central areas marked at the sides with deep ruts in the di- 
rection of the lines of growth. General colour bay, inclin- 
ing to grey at the edges, varied with light patches, and occa- 
sional bands of light brown.

This shell is not common in the red crag, although very

identity with the British variety of Lamarck's Nucula mar- 
garitacea; and though this species appears to have existed 
from the commencement of the tertiary period, the specimens 
from the Paris basin, as well as those from the London clay, 
are much larger than those of the crag ; a condition perhaps 
depending upon the reduction in temperature which the cli- 
mate of this part of the globe is supposed to have undergone, 
since the eocene strata were deposited.

sion being quite smooth. This shell appears to connect the 
two species above referred to, having the contour of the former 
with the entire margin and delicacy of the latter.

The red crag specimens, judging from those which T have

seen, are flatter than those from the mammaliferous deposit. 
The spechnen mentioned by Sowerby as having been found 
at Roydon, Norfolk, is an error, there being no crag within 
many miles of that place. Koydon was at one time the resi- 
dence of my late friend, the Rev. G. R. Leathes, a well-known 
collector of the crag fossils, and in this way the mistake pro- 
bably had its origin. This shell, when found in the mam- 
maliferous crag, has the valves occasionally in contact, and in 
a state of preservation which shows that they are regularly 
and concentrically striated. Specimens are now and then 
found much thickened internally, leaving two deep, sub-oval, 
muscular impressions : there is a very small sinus in the im- 
pression of the mantle on the shorter side, which, on that ac- 
count, I suppose to be also the posterior side.

This shell has been found plentifully at Walton, but I have 
only a few small specimens from the coralline crag. It is 
perfectly smooth externally, free from markings of any kind, 
and a more transverse shell than the preceding ; my largest 
specimen measures nearly an inch and a half across its wid- 
est diameter. The figures of these two shells are so coiTectly 
given in the ' Mineral Conchology,' that any further represen- 
tation is unnecessary.

This I presume to be a rare fossil, not having found more 
than half a dozen specimens, and those all at the above loca- 
lity : mine are all adult shells, being much thickened inter- 
nally. The figure above referred to is excellent, but no men- 
tion is made of the markings which ornament the exterior, 
consisting of slightly undulating lines running in an oblique 
direction, and at an angle of about 30° with an imaginary 
line drawn through its transverse diameter. A shell from the 
Arctic Ocean, now in the British Museum, figured and de- 
scribed in the ' Zoological Journal,' vol. iv. p. 359, pi. 9, f 1, 
imder the name of Niic. arctica, appears identical with this 
species ; it is, however, rather thinner and smaller, a difference 
which may depend upon climate or other incidental causes. 
There is a small .s^/^^*.s in the anterior margin of the crag shell 
(at least in my specimens), which T did not find in the recent

few more specimens of each of these would establish the 
specific identity of the two. The muscular impressions in 
the crag fossil are rendered indistinct by its internal thicken- 
ing.

This Nucula appears to be quite distinct from the preced 
ing, for which it has nevertheless been mistaken. I have 
never seen the young of the ohlonga, but the following cha- 
racters induce me to regard it as distinct from that species. 
It is more equilateral ; the difference between the anterior 
and posterior portions of the ohlonga being at least in the 
proportion of two to one, while in this there is but a trifling 
difference. The teeth also are more equally divided than in 
Nuc. ohlonga. It has a smooth exterior in the place of the 
diagonal lines which ornament that shell ; there is also no 
sinus in the anterior margin, and the pallial scar reaches 
nearly as far as to a line drawn fi-om the ligamental pit to the 
centre of the ventral margin ; the lines of growth are the 
only exterior marks that I have been able to detect.

I have not seen this from any other locality than the one 
named, but it is by no means rare at that spot : specimens 
in size about half that of the above may be obtained in con- 
siderable numbers. One half of the shell is strongly striated 
exijept on the posterior slope, where the strice are nearly ob- 
literated ; these stricd, or rather ridges, with spaces between 
them forming small furrows, are only on the posterior side, 
as if that half of the shell had been buried in the sand, while 
the other had been worn smooth by exposure. The lunula 
is large, lanceolate, and smooth, with a distinct corselet of a 
lanceolate form; the muscular impressions are indistinct; 
and the shell being thin, the transverse fun'ows are visible on

the inside. The deltoid ligaincntal pit varies much in shape, 
and cannot be depended upon as a character, some speci- 
mens having a central elevation dividing the pit into two 
parts. Nucula ohlonga has nearly twice the number of teeth 
on one side that it has on the other, whereas in this species 
they are nearly equal in number.

Of this shell I have found but one specimen, which, how-

the British recent species. It is however rather more trans- 
verse, the posterior or acuminated side being a little more 
produced, thereby removing the umbo farther from the centre, 
but from the examination of only a single specimen I should 
not venture to regard these distinctions as specific. I found 
it myself in undisturbed red crag, three feet beneath the super- 
incumbent sand.

consider the shell, from the figure and short description Gold- 
fuss has given, to be the same. My shell is strong, tumid, 
and perfectly smooth ; hinge-line broad, forming a large ob- 
tuse angle with the umbo : eight to ten strong teeth (some 
of which are prominent and angulated) on each side of a 
small ligamental pit ; lateral muscular impression large, that 
of the mantle indistinct. The Scottish shell has the acumi- 
nated side larger than the crag one, and the figure in Gold- 
fuss is more oval in shape, but the contour is, I think, insuffi- 
cient to indicate a specific difference, my own specimens 
varying, in that respect, among themselves ; the younger ones 
being less acuminated than those which I suppose are adult. 
The valves from Ramsholt are often found united together by 
their large prominent teeth, which, in arrangement, correspond 
with the Scottish shell ; the interior of the Sicilian one is not 
represented.

Art. VII. — Description of a neiv Marsupial Mammal, belonging 
to the genus Phascogale. By. G. R. Waterhouse, Esq., Cu- 
rator to the Museum of the Zoological Society, &c. 

The little quadruped I am about to describe, belongs to that 
section of Australian mammals (order Marsupalia), which 
M. Temminck^ separates from the genus Dasyurus of Geof- 
froy S. Hilaire,* under the name Phascogale ; the type of 
this genus being the Didelphis penicillatus of Shaw, ^ which, 
through the kindness of Professor Owen (who allowed me to 
examine the original specimen sent over by White, and now 
in the Museum of the College of Surgeons), I am enabled to 
state, is the Tapoa Tafa, or Tapha, of White.* The identi- 
fication of Phase, peniclllata with the Tapoa Tafa, is of some 
little importance, since the Dasyurus Tafa, of Geoffroy, which 
appears in most works as a distinct species, is founded upon 
White's animal. 

In Temmincks' ' Monographies' a second species oi Phas- 
cogale is described, that author having placed in this genus 
the Dasyurus mmimus of Geoffroy ; but as he had not the op- 
portunity of examining the dentition of this animal, he felt 
doubtful whether it might not prove to be the young of a spe- 
cies, the adult state of which remained to be discovered.

300 DESCRIPTION OF A NEW MARSUPIAL MAMMAL. 

In the ^ Proceedings of the Zoological Society,' for July, 
1837, two other species of this genus are described by my- 
self, under the names Phase. Jlavipes, and Phase, murina ; 
of both these species I had an opportunity of examining the 
dentition, and as I found them to be adult animals closely 
allied to Didelphis minimus, it is almost certain that that 
animal is also adult, since it would appear that it was the 
smallness of its size, which led M. Temminck to believe it 
might be young. I may mention, that one of the species 
described by myself (the Phase, murina) is smaller than Did. 
minimus, and that both the species agree in all essential par- 
ticulars with the larger typical species, which latter differs 
from others of the genus hitherto discovered in having long 
hairs forming a kind of bush on the apical half of the tail. 

I am now enabled to add a fifth species to the genus Phas- 
cog ale, and of which I have drawn up the following descrip- 
tion. The original is in the museum of Mr. Swainson, who 
has kindly permitted me to examine and describe it, and whose 
name I have made use of, to distinguish the species. 

Swain son's Phascogale. 

Phascogale Swainsonii, Waterhouse. 

This species is rather larger than either the Phas. flavi- 
pes or Phas. minima : its fur, instead of being, as in 
Phas. Jlavipes, of a yellow-grey tint, is of a dark and rich 
brown hue ; the under parts of the body are deep grey, 
slightly grizzled with white, whereas in Phas. Jlavipes, the 
under parts are yellow and white : the most important differ- 
ences, however, consist in the more attenuated and elongated 
form of the head, especially of the anterior portion ; the 
teeth, nevertheless, form an uninterrupted series, hence each 
tooth (especially the false molars), has a proportionately 
greater antero-posterior extent. The distance from the fore- 
part of the front incisors of the upper jaw to the hinder part 
of the third true molar in Phase. Swainsonii, is 1^ lines, 
whilst in Phase. Jlavipes, the same measurement gives 6f 
lines : the teeth are less powerful than in the animal last 
mentioned, and the incisors of the upper jaw form an unin- 
terrupted series, whilst in Phase. Jlavipes, there is an inter- 
space on either side between the anterior pair of incisors 
and the lateral ones. In the elongated and slender form of 
the muzzle, and more delicate teeth, the present animal 
evinces an approach to the Myrmeeohius ; its fur is mode- 
rately soft, rather long and glossy, of a deep slate- colour

next the skin ; the hairs are most of them narrowly annu- 
lated towards the apex with rich brown, or yellow-brown ; 
the longer hairs are black ; on the under parts of the body, 
the hairs (which, like those of the upper parts, are of a deep 
slate-grey at the base), are slightly tipped with brownish- 
white, or ash-colour ; the feet are covered with dark brown 
hairs above (not yellow as in Phase. Jiavipes) ; the tail is 
also dark brown, and on the upper side inclining to black ; 
the hairs on this part are all short and adpressed. 

There are other differences between the present species 
and that with which we are comparing it, which may help to 
distinguish them, I allude to the colouring of the head : in 
Phase. Jlampes, the upper lip, lower part of the cheeks, chin, 
and throat, are white, and there is, moreover, a white spot 
beneath the eye, whereas, in Phase. Swainsonii, no white is 
visible, indeed the head is almost of an uniform colour with 
the body, the hairs on the sides and upper parts are black, 
slightly grizzled with yellowish, and on the chin and throat 
they are grey, tinted with brownish, especially on the chin. 

The specimen from which this description is drawn up, is 
apparently a female, and furnishes the following dimensions ; 
length from nose to root of tail, 5" 2'" ; tail about 3" 5"' ; 
head, about 1" 2"' ; tarsus to end of claws, 10 lines : it is 
from Van Dieman's Land.

Art. VIII. — On the occurrence of a Fossil Dragon-fly in the Lias 
of Warwickshire. By H. E. Strickland, Esq., F.G.S., &c. 

The accompanying drawing (fig. 11), represents a very perfect 
wing of a Libelluline insect, lately found in the lias of 
Warwickshire. It is the property of Mr. J. Gibbs of Eves- 
ham, who has kindly lent it to me for examination and de- 
scription. It exhibits a very distinct impression on the sur- 
face of a slab of blue lias limestone, the wing being of a 
pale brown colour, and the nervures a darker tint of the 
same. The opaque spot which exists at the anterior margin 
of the wing in most of the Lihellulidce, is here distinctly 
marked, being of a much darker brown than any other part 
of the wing. 

This specimen appears to be the left anterior wing of the 
insect. On comparing it with recent species of LibelliiUdce 
it exhibits a close resemblance to them in the general ar-

rangemeiit of the nervures. It is well known that the in- 
sects of this family present certain generic peculiarities in the 
nervures at the base of the wings. In this respect the spe- 
cimen before us exhibits characters most nearly allied to the 
genus JEshna^ Fab., but approximating also to the structure 
of Lihellula. These distinctions being more easily shown 
by drawings than description, the reader is referred to the 
figures, where the originals have all been carefully copied of

in Libellula depressa. The dimensions of the fossil are 
about one-third greater than those of JEishna grandis, one 
of the largest of our British species, its length being 2 inches 
lOj lines, and its greatest breadth 8 J lines. 

It is proposed, for the sake of distinction, to denominate 
this fossil insect JRshna Uassina. 

The specimen before us furnishes, I believe, the first ex- 
ample of an insect of this family in so old a formation as the 
lias. It is well known that Lihellul(B occur in the lithogra- 
phic stone of Solenhofen, * which belongs to the upper part 
of the oolitic series, and is the lowest rock in which these 
insects have hitherto been found. The present specimen is, 
therefore, unquestionably of great geological interest, espe- 
cially when we contrast its close affinity to existing forms, 
with the extraordinary saurian, piscine, and molluscous 
structures which were its contemporaries. 

This specimen was found in the neighbourhood of Binton,

near Bidford, in Warwickshire, where the beds of limestone 
near the base of the lias are largely quarried for flooring, &c. 
These beds of limestone, besides the usual Ammonites, &c. 
of the lias, occasionally contain specimens of Ichthyosauri, 
Plesiosauri, three or four species of fish, crustaceans, and 
two or three species of ferns. The latter circumstance indi- 
cates the proximity of land at the time of the deposition of 
the strata, a supposition which is further borne out by the 
fossil insect above described. 

One of the species of fish found here appears to be a Cy- 
cloid, and furnishes an exception to the generalization of 
M. Agissiz, that no cycloidian fish occur below the chalk. 

In the first series of this Magazine, vol. v. p. 549, is a 
figure of a fossil fish from Wilmcote (misspelt Wilments), 
near Binton. This specimen is now in the Warwick Museum, 
and has been figured by M. Agassiz, under the name of Te- 
tragonolepis angulifer. 

The rock in which these fossils are found, is a fine-gi'ained 
blue limestone, dividing into thin slabs, resembling in tex- 
ture the Solenhofen stone, and like it adapted to lithographic 
purposes.

Art. IX. — Notice of the existence of a distinct Tube within the 
hollows of the Paramoudra. By Robt. Fitch, Esq., F.G.S. 

After the interest which has been felt upon the subject 
of the Paramoudras or pot-stones of the chalk, through the 
observations of Professors Buckland, Ehren- 
berg, and other writers, I am surprised that 
one fact in the history of these most singular 
bodies should hitherto have escaped notice: — 
I refer to the existence of a central tube 
passing through the long axis of each chalk 
nucleus, and as I am led to imagine, origi- 
nally forming a connecting link between the 
detached pieces of the entire column, as seen 
in the accompanying section (fig. 14). In 
this sketch I have represented the extremities 
of the two Paramoudras in contact, as I have 
fi-equently found this to be the case. Dr. 
Buckland attributes their being so to accident, 
remarking " sometimes the extremities of two 
specimens are found in contact, but this seems 
to be the result of accidental juxta-position, not of any ori- 




304 TUBE IN THE PARAMOUDRA. 

ginal connexion of the animal bodies." ' Geol. Trans.,' vol. iv. 

The superior terminal Paramoudra, I have always found 
round and closed at the top, but upon breaking it, there will 
be found in every specimen, the tube passing through from 
the chalk into the substance of the flint, and coming out on 
one side two or three inches below the top. 

Mr. Lyell, in his paper read at the meeting of the British 
Association, 1838, says that each Paramoudra contains inva- 
riahly the cylindrical nucleus of chalk : this is not always the 
case, for during one of my visits to the pit at Horstead last 
October, I was breaking a specimen for examination, when, 
instead of finding chalk, I found it flint throughout, and the 
hollow tube quite silicified passing through the centre, as I 
have invariably found it passing through the chalk nucleus. 
I have since found another similar specimen at Whittingham. 
I have observed in the chalk nucleus, several Ventriculites, 
Ananchytes, Plagiostoma spinosa, Terehratula octoplicata, 
and indeed, most of the fossils common in our chalk ; and in 
almost all the specimens that I have broken, have found mass- 
es of Pyrites usually attached to the flint, but projecting 
into the chalk nucleus ; occasionally I have observed the 
belemnite passing through the flint, and entering the chalk 
nucleus. 

Norwich,' Feb. 10, 1840. 

[Can this curious tube be in any way connected with the aggregation 
of Hinty matter forming the paramoudral column ? If the pot stones 
were originally sponges, or organic bodies of any kind, how comes it that 
when broken they display no structure, or at any rate, nothing which will 
distinguish them from the ordinary nodula or tabular chalk-ilints ? 

After spending a morning in the chalk-pit at Horstead, near Norwich, 
and breaking a considerable number of the Paramoudras, we found the 
tube present in every instance ; sometimes however, so nearly obli- 
terated as to be only traceable by the discoloration of the chalk around 
its original site. The tube varies in diameter from the thickness of an 
ordinary-sized quill, to that of the finger. The wall of the tube is gene- 
rally of a green colour, and about as thick as the rind of an apple ; the 
cavity is filled with chalk. Mr. Bowerbank finds it to consist of siliceous 
particles. The mode in which the tube quits the chalk, and passes through 
the flint cap of the terminal Paramoudra is very remarkable. We believe 
the sole merit of this discovery to rest with our correspondent Mr. Robt. 
Fitch.]— Ed. 



ON AFFINITY AND ANALOGY. 305 



Art. X. — A few further Observations on Affinity and Analogy. 
By J. O. Westwood, Esq., F.LS. 

Coinciding, as I fully do, in many of Mr. H. E. Strick- 
land's observations on the distinction existing between 
the affinities and analogies of organized beings, allow me a 
few lines to correct the erroneous impression which his illus- 
tration (pp. 224 and 225) of my remarks, is likely to cause, 
and to remove the notion that they contain a fallacy. The 
object of my short article was to record my opinion, — 

1. That relations of analogy and affinity are nothing else 
than instances of more or less perfect resemblance : and 

2. That as these relations are absolutely comparative in 
their nature, it follows that both kind of relations may co- 
exist at the same time between any two animals, according 
to the animals compared therewith. These opinions may be 
thus illustrated : — 

1. The natural system depends not only upon the exist- 
ence of a resemblance in essential peculiarities of structure, 
or an agreement in the numerical majority of characteristics, 
whereby the species of a genus, the genera of a family, the 
families of an order, or the orders of a class, are linked to- 
gether, whence the origin of affinity, but also upon less per- 
fect resemblances, whereby a species of one genus is com- 
pared with a species in some other genus, family, or order, or 
a genus in one family is compared with a genus in some 
other family, and so on, whence the origin of analogy. Both 
these relations are, however, necessarily dependent upon re- 
semblance, and the approximations of which Mr. Blyth speaks, 
not only prove the occasional difficulty of drawing the line 
between the two kinds of relations, but also the truth of the 
Linnasan adage " Natura non facit saltus," a principle which 
Mr. Strickland would adopt in the lower groups, but reject 
in the higher. 

2. The co-existence of these relations between any two 
objects, is illustrated by the goat-sucker, bat, dragon-fly, and 
DioncBa in the following manner. All these animals possess 
inter se,m. their common character of fly-catchers, an analo- 
gical relation ; but when I compare the two former, as verte- 
brated animals, with the dragon-fly, as an invertebrated 
animal, I find a higher relation (that is an affinity) existing 
between the bat and the goat-sucker, than subsists between 
either of these and the dragon-fly. When, however, I com- 
pare these three animals with the plant, Dioncsa, I find a re- 
lation (that is an affinity) established between the dragon-fly 



306 ARGYNNIS APHRODITE. 

and the two other animals, exactly as much higher than the 
relation between these animals and the plant, as the relation 
between the dragon-fly and the bat or the goat-sucker was, 
when these two last-named animals were compared with the 
dragon-fly. In other words, instead of saying, as Mr. Strick- 
land makes me say, that " an affinity subsists between the bat 
and dragon-fly, when compared with the DiorKBa, and an 
analogy when compared with the goat-sucker," I should say 
that an affinity exists between the bat and dragon-fly, when 
these two animals are compared with the vegetable, DioncBa, 
and that an analogy exists between two such animals, when 
the vertebrated bat is compared wdth the vertebrated goat- 
sucker. Again, from the comparative nature of these re- 
semblances, it appears to me that the relation which exists 
between the goat-sucker and dragon-fly, when these two ani- 
mals are compared with a Dioncea, is as close an affinity as 
that which exists between the goat-sucker and the swallow, 
when these two birds are compared with the bat. Independ- 
ent of such comparison, the two birds are, of course, closer 
in affinity than one of the birds and the bat. Whilst, as 
Mr. Strickland justly remarks, the dragon-fly (independent of 
its fly-catching habit), has no more affinity to the goat-sucker 
than a beetle, a lobster, or any other annulose animal. 



Argynnis Aphrodite, a British species. — I was very much 
gratified by the appearance of Arg. Aphrodite in the illus- 
trations to the Magazine, as a few years ago, while out en- 
tomologizing, I saw, in a brake of thorns near a wood (Coed 
Gwynion), a short distance from the town, a beautiful Argyn- 
nis. I stood observing it some time ; I was within four feet 
of it, so that I had a good opportunity of observation. It 
being a stranger to me, I searched Duncan's ' British Butter- 
flies' for it, but in vain : Arg. Paphia was the nearest, but 
my stranger had a row of crescent-shaped marks towards the 
external edges of its wing; Paphia is represented with 
spots instead of crescents in the above work. From the other 
large Argynnides it differed in not having a black border on the 
outside of the crescents. At the time I concluded that it was 
Arg. Paphia, thinking that the figures of the markings might 
not be exactly delineated, as it oftentimes happens in cheap 
works, that they cannot take the time necessary for perfectly 
drawing and colouring the plates ; but if the Argynnides in 
the above work are truly figured, it is a moral certainty in my 
own mind, that the butterfly I saw was Arg. Aphrodite. —

( Continued from page 259.^ 

Third Order MYOIDEA. 

Family of Rodents. 

The most numerous genus of this family is the genus Mus, 
of which I am acquainted with six species, indigenous to 
this district, besides two which have been introduced, the 
one from Europe [Mus. musculus), the other, as I suspect, 
from Asia [Mus setosus, mihi.) The abundant remains of 
this genus that I have collected from the caverns, prove its 
existence in the ancient world. The species, difficult to dis- 
tinguish by external characters, are still more so when we 
have nothing more than fragments of their skeletons. Among 
the remains hitherto obtained, I can distinguish two, or per- 
haps three extinct species, without being able to speak more 
decidedly as to their relation to those still existing. 

Next to the genus Mus, with reference to the number of spe- 
cies, follows that of Echimys {Loncheres, 111.), or spiny rats. 
This genus comprises here four species, as distinguishable 
from each other by their outward form, as they are closely 
allied in their internal structure. The largest species (E. 
apereoides, mihi), bears the most striking resemblance to the 
Pered [Ancema Aperea) in size, colour, form, and whole ap- 
pearance ; excepting that it is provided with a long and very 
hairy tail. It has no trace of spines ; and its hair is of ordi-

nary quality. In several caverns I have found remains of a 
fossil species, which approaches it very nearly, but at the 
same time exhibits some specific distinctions, and moreover, 
rather exceeds it in size. Another species [Ech. elegans^ mihi) 
is of the size of our large house-rat [M.us decuynanus), to 
which it bears a perfect external resemblance, and is furnished 
with a very long, bare tail. It is armed with spines, and 
displays a purity of colour that makes it a very pretty little 
animal. I have discovered the fossil remains of a species, 
which, judging by the fragments I possess, agrees well enough 
with this. A third species {Ech. sulciclens) I am only ac- 
quainted with from the abundant remains it has left upon the 
surface of the soil in the caves, where they form no inconsi- 
derable portion of the vast heaps of bones I have described 
in my preceding communication. I have also found traces 
of a species belonging to the fossil period, which seems to 
agree very closely with this recent animal ; but I have again 
to lament that the fragments I as yet possess, are not suffi- 
cient to enable me to pronounce decidedly on its identity. 

A fourth species {Ech. laticeps, mihi) is rare, and I have 
not met with any trace of a corresponding species among 
the fossil bones of these caverns. 

Equally peculiar to South America as the preceding genus, 
to which it also bears a near affinity, is the genus Synetheres, 
of which there are only two known species, Syn. prehensilisy 
L., and Syn, insidiosa, Licht. ;^ the last of the size of a rab- 
bit, the former twice as large. The antediluvian world also 
possessed this animal form, but, with the character peculiar 
to that ancient fauna, of a gigantic size ; for the fragments 
that I have, betoken a creature very little inferior in bulk to 
the wild hog. The fossil species, moreover, presents a nearer 
resemblance to the smaller existing species (Syn. insidiosa) 
than to the larger [Syn. prehensilis), so that it would be classed 
by those zoologists who make a generic division between 
these two species, under the genus Sphiggurus. 

Each of the remaining genera of this family, viz. Sciurus, 
Lepus, Ancema, Dasyprocta, Coelogenys, and Hydrochoerus, 
contains at present but a single species. 

Of the first genus I have hitherto found no trace whatever 

' I cannot agree with the views of some of our modern zoologists who 
make a generic distinction hetween these two species {Synetheres and 
Sphiggurus, F. Cuv.), inasmuch as they sufficiently agree in their hahits, 
external appearance, and even in their internal structure, especially in their 
dental system. The principal difference lies in the great development of 
the nasal and frontal hones, which the former possesses, in common with 
the Hystrices of the old world, hut which is not seen in the latter. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 309 

in the diliivian soil ; on the other hand, I have discovered 
bones of a small and evidently rodent animal, which does 
not agree with any of the genera at present existing in this 
country. 

The caves contain abundant fossil remains of the genera 
Lepus and Anooma ; and still more of a species belonging to 
the genus Dasijprocta ; all of which resemble more or less 
closely the recent species of their respective genera. There 
is, however, a second species of the last-named genus which 
merits a particular notice, not merely from its much greater 
rarity, but from its extraordinary size, which at first misled 
me in the identification of its bones. The long bones of the 
hinder extremities of this species are, in fact, almost as large 
as those of the roebuck, for which reason I propose for it the 
name of Damj. capreolufi, in order to connect -with its spe- 
cific title an idea of a size so unusual in this family. 

The same relation which we have observed in the genus 
Cutia, is repeated in the genus Capivar. I find two extinct 
species of this genus; the one identical with that now existing, 
the other, on the contrary, of astonishing size. I propose 
for this last, the name Hydrochoertis sulcidens, because its 
incisors, instead of being smooth, as in the living species, 
are furnished on their anterior surface with a number of lon- 
gitudinal furrows, separated by parallel, rifle-like ridges. It 
approached the very considerable dimensions of five feet in 
length, so as to stand exactly midway between the existing 
species of this genus, and the giant of South America's recent 
fauna, the tapir. 

I conclude my brief survey of this family with a genus 
that requires a more detailed examination than the former, 
on account of the important light it throws upon the ancient 
fauna, and its relation to the recent ; I mean the genus Paca. * 
The remains of this genus, in a fossil state, are found in the 
soil of most of the Brazilian caves : I have endeavoured, in 
my description of that of Cerca Grande, to convey some idea of 
the astonishing extent to which they are there amassed. A 
cursory examination of these remains showed me no essen- 
tial difference from the recent Paca. We have already, in 
our survey of the previous families, met with fossil remains 
that seemed to agree more or less accurately with existing 
animals, but whose complete identity we were prevented from 
determining by the imperfect state of the fragments. But it 
is particularly in the family now under review, that this diffi- 
culty so frequently occurs ; the genera Echimys^ Ancema, 
Lepus, and Dasyprocta, have furnished examples of this. 
What has thus occurred to myself in the determination of the 

' Coelogeiiy.s. 



310 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

species of the extinct fauna of this continent, has also 
happened to those who have been occupied in similar 
researches in the old world ; and the important question 
yet remains unanswered, whether in fact species identically 
the same, can be shown as belonging to these two periods. 
The genus now under consideration, seems likely to afford 
a solution to this question, on at least one point. On 
the one side, the complete identity with the living spe- 
cies which the first view of the fossil remains of this genus 
exhibited, seemed to authorize me to consider it in the same 
light as those already described as coinciding more or less 
with existing genera ; while on the other hand, the extraor- 
dinary abundance and perfect state of the materials for 
comparison, which I possessed of this genus, far exceeding 
those at the disposal of any former zoologist, enabled me 
to decide the point, so far as it referred to the corresponding 
species of this district, with an accuracy which could not 
leave any room for doubt or uncertainty. Two subsequent 
visits to that remarkable cave, and long-continued exca- 
vations, had so multiplied my materials, that I was enabled to 
enter upon the investigation with more or less perfect re- 
mains of above a hundred individuals, of all ages. 

The result of these examinations was equally surprising 
and conclusive. In spite of the close correspondence in 
every other part of the skeleton, a more exact consideration 
of the skulls, proved that the vast number of the fossil re- 
mains of this genus consisted of two species, both of which 
are very distinct from the living Paca. One of these I call 
Ccelogenys laticeps, from the circumstance of the zygomatic 
arches being posteriorly so far retired from the skull, that it 
acquires the appearance of being pressed flat. The other 
species I have already described under the title of Coelogenys 
rugiceps, a name that well becomes it. In this species the 
glenoid cavities and adjoining zygomata are so extraordi- 
narily developed, that these same anatomical relations in the 
existing species seem to be only a feeble indication of the 
almost monstrous development that gives the skull of this 
species so peculiar a character. Both these species appear 
to have been very common in those olden times ; but much 
rarer are the remains of a third species, Coelogenys ma- 
jor, which considerably surpasses both the former in size, 
and which, in this respect, is not inferior to the living Ca- 
pivar. 

These examinations of the genus Paca, which, from their 
completeness, may serve for the foundation of the subsequent 
comparisons, give the same relations for this genus, that we 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 311 

have already remarked in the genera Cutia and Capivar ; 
namely that the ancient fauna possessed two subordinate 
forms of this genus, of which one shows a striking agreement 
with the existing species, while the other repeats it on a mag- 
nified scale. The first of these subordinate forms comprises 
two species in the genus Paca ; whereas in the two last- 
named genera, we are only acquainted with a single species 
of each, most probably in consequence of the imperfect state 
of our materials. How far this subordinate form is to be 
considered as specifically identical with the existing animal, 
we have been able to decide with certainty in the genus 
Paca ; and we are entitled, at least for the present, to extend 
this result not only to the other genera of this family, which 
are found similarly circumstanced, but still more to those out 
of it, in which the resemblance between extinct and living 
forms is much less obvious. With reference to the numeri- 
cal relations of this family in the present and foiTner periods, 
we see that only one of the existing genera is absent from 
the list of the fossil genera, namely that of squirrels. The 
contrary could scarcely have been expected. The squirrel 
is an animal whose habits and haunts entirely protect it from 
the pursuit of the larger predaceous beasts ; and that it evi- 
dently also very seldom becomes the prey of birds, I con- 
clude from the circumstance of my having never seen any 
trace of it in those heaps of bones that are formed in the 
caves from the remnants of the food of the Strix perlata. 
The absence hitherto of this genus, therefore, from the list of 
fossil species, does not warrant us in concluding that this 
form was in reality non-existent in those former times : on 
the contrary we may suppose, with a high degree of proba- 
bility, that inasmuch as this family presented so perfect an 
agreement in those ages with what it now contains, neither 
was this form wanting. 

In addition, there appears on the list of the extinct fauna 
a genus which is not now found here ; whence it seems that 
the greater variety or richness of generic forms, which for- 
merly characterized all the families we have yet considered, 
also extends to this. Of the nine genera whereof this family 
now consists, six are peculiar to this continent ; the Capi- 
t)ar, Paca, Cutia, Perea, Synetheres, and EcJmnys. All 
these genera are again found in the extinct fauna of this dis- 
trict : and we thus obtain one of the most beautiful and con- 
clusive arguments for a result we have already frequently 
insisted on, namely, that the extinct fauna of this continent 
was a true prototype of the existing races. Before I proceed 
to compare the number of species of this family for the two 



312 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

periods, I think it right to add a few remarks respecting the 
conditions in which the fossils are found. The remains of 
the larger kinds appear under the same circumstances as the 
former family, that is, scattered about in the soil of the ca- 
verns, and gnawed ; in short, exhibiting unequivocal marks 
of having been dragged in by beasts of prey. Occasionally, 
also, I have found the bones of smaller kinds similarly cir- 
cumstanced, and intermixed with the remains of the larger 
animals ; so that I am led to conclude that these also have, 
in some instances, served for food to the Carnivora. But 
more frequently the remains of these lesser species are seen 
separate from those of the greater, and forming a kind of 
osseous conglomerate by themselves. I have in my former 
paper given a detailed account of the remarkable masses of 
bones which are collected in these caves, even in our own 
day, and which I have shown to be attributable to the St7'ix 
perlata, Licht. Now, if we suppose an in*uption of water 
penetrating into these caverns, dispersing the heaps of bones, 
find enveloping the scattered fragments in its sedimentary 
soil, which, in the process of time, would be impregnated 
with calcareous particles from the dripping of the roof, and 
thus be converted into a perfectly hard mass, that would act 
as a cement to the bones ; under such conditions we should 
have the very breccia of which I have spoken. Indeed, the 
resemblance between these osseous conglomerates, and the 
heaps of bones above described, is so striking, that at the 
first I was mistaken as to their respective age : ^ for the ani- 
mals of whose remains they are composed, are in the main 
the same, being principally species of the genera Mus, Echi- 
mys, An OS ma, or young individuals oi Lepus. The total num- 
ber of the species of this family that at present exist here is 
eighteen ; whereas I have as yet discovered only sixteen be- 
longing to the extinct fauna. The genus Mus constitutes a 
third part of the whole existing number ; and it is precisely 
this genus that gives the list of recent species its preponder- 
ance over that of the fossil. But this present superiority of 
the genus Mus, with regard to the number of species, in all 
probability arises from our greater ignorance of the ancient 
fauna. Long before I was acquainted with some of the re- 
cent species of this genus, now existing here, I possessed 
hundreds of fragments of their skeletons ; but among these 

* Thus ill my description of the cave of Maquine, I have mentioned a 
similar breccia in its second chamber, which I then considered to be a re- 
cent formation ; but later investigations have convinced me that the os- 
seous remains it contains belong to a more ancient fauna. 



PKEVTOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 313 

I was unable to distinguish accurately more than two, or at 
the most three species, whereas an examination of the Na- 
tural History of the district soon convinced me of the exist- 
ence of six species in these parts. If we then suppose the 
same number of species to have existed in the former epoch, 
wiiich we know to exist now (a supposition evidently not too 
over-stretched for a period that is proved to have been so rich 
in animal forms), we have already a greater number of species 
for that period than for the present ; and we are emboldened 
to extend to this family also, the result to which the consi- 
deration of all the other families has led us, namely, the su- 
periority of the ancient fauna over the present, with reference 
to variety of species. This conclusion, which must be con- 
sidered as established for the family taken as a whole, is also 
true for many of its genera, as for instance, Cutia, Capivar, 
and Paca. We have already observed the same fact in one 
family, in the instance of the genus Dicotyles ; and we are 
thus conducted to the remarkable result, that not only are all 
the families we have hitherto examined to be consider- 
ed as mere fragments of what they were in former times, 
but that also many of their genera are similarly circum- 
stanced. A closer examination of these genera acquaints us 
also with two other facts, not less important, namely, first 
that they are all such as are now peculiar to the new world ; 
and secondly, that such of their specific forms as have re- 
presentatives in the existing fauna, are distinguished by a 
smaller bulk than those which have no such representatives 
now ; so that we are induced to regard the existing fauna as 
a repetition of the extinct, on a diminished scale, with refer- 
ence both to numbers and size. 

Family of Marsupials. 

Of this family there is only a single existing genus in this 
district : it is, however, tolerably abundant in species. These 
admit of two subdivisions according to their size ; one com- 
prising the larger species, which both in habits and magni- 
tude may be compared to our martens and polecats ; the 
other the smaller, that scarcely exceed our mice and rats. 
I am acquainted with tvvo species in the first division, Didel- 
phis aiirita, Pr. Max., and Did. alhiventer., mihi, and three 
in the latter, Did. murina, Lin., Did. hrachyura, Pall., and 
Did. pusilla, Desm. I find the fossil remains of species be- 
longing to both these divisions, which, for the present, I 
refer to only two species ; at the same time applying to this 
genus the observations I made respecting the number of spe- 



314 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

cies ill the genus Mui^ of that former period, from which I 
deduced the conclusion that we have no ground for believing 
this number to have been in reality less than it now is. The 
fossils of this family are found under the same conditions as 
those of the rodents ; the bones of the smaller kinds entering 
into the composition of the fine osseous breccia, while those 
of the larger species are intermixed with the bones of those 
animals that have constituted the food of the beasts of prey.' 

Family of Bats. 

All the families we have hitherto considered, have either 
exhibited to us a greater abundance both of genera and spe- 
cies, in the former than in the present period, or have at least 
allowed room for the supposition that they were not inferior 
in this respect. It is otherwise with the family we now pro- 
ceed to examine. Notwithstanding the most careful search, 
I have not yet been able to discover the least trace of any 
animal of this family in the sediment of the last great deluge 
in this district ; and, as far as my information extends, the in- 
vestigations of scientific men in the old world have been 
equally unsuccessful. We might thus seem authorized to 
conclude, that this family w^as really wanting in the pre- 
existent fauna. I must, however, draw attention to several 
circumstances that show the necessity of caution, before we 
come to a positive decision on this point. Of all mammals, bats 
are the least exposed to the attacks of predatory beasts ; and 
we therefore could hardly expect to meet with their remains 
among those of the animals that have served for their food. 
It would, on the other hand, appear probable that they should 
be the prey of owls, through whose instrumentality many of 
the other bones have been introduced into our caves. 
I have, however, shown, in my former communication, how 
very small a quotient (only 1 per cent.) their bones consti- 
tute in the composition of these heaps. If to these consi- 
derations we add the fact that this family has left traces of its 
existence in a still more ancient period of the world, in the 
gypsum of Montmartre, we surely see that we must not, with- 
out a very strong amount of proof, agree to so extraordinary 
a result, as such an alternating appearance, disappearance, 

1 I possess a molar tooth of a large animal, which differs in its form 
from the molars of all predaceous animals, and most nearly approaches 
the hindmost teeth of Didelphis. Until I am fortunate enough lo obtain 
more fragments of this remarkable animal, I abstain from guessing at its 
proper place in the system. The tooth seems to belong to an animal of 
the size of a large wol£ 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 315 

and re-appearance of an animal family would be. I there- 
fore abstain for the present from offering any opinion what- 
ever on this subject ; although I must confess that this con- 
stant failure of all my efforts to find in the soil of the caves 
even a trace of any single individual of this family, has 
already long excited my wonder ; the rather, because the 
family of bats is now, next to the rodents and Ferae, the 
most abundant in species within this district ; and, as I have 
elsewhere shown, claims the first place on the list of those 
animals which, in the present day, make caverns their resi- 
dence. 

Fourth Order, QUADRUMANA. 

Family of Apes, (Simiae.) 

If my attempts to discover any of the preceding family 
(Bats), have hitherto been fruitless, so have they been re- 
warded with most unexpected success, in the case of the 
family I next proceed to consider. I am at length enabled 
to solve the important question as to the existence of the 
highest class of mammals in those ancient times to which 
these fossils belong ; a question which has as yet been unan- 
swered, or which most philosophers have thought right to 
answer in the negative. It is certain this family was then in 
existence ; and the first animal of the class recovered is of 
gigantic size, a character belonging to the organization 
of the period. It considerably exceeds the largest indivi- 
duals of the orang-outang, or Chimpanzee, yet seen ; from 
which also, as well as from the long-armed apes (Hylohates), 
it is generically distinct. As it equally differs from the apes 
now living here, I would place it for the present in a genus 
of its own, for which I propose the name Protopiihecus : 
with the specific distinction Prot. brasiliensis, from the quar- 
ter where the first representative of this family saw the light 
of day. I cannot omit this opportunity of recording a tra- 
dition very general over a considerable extent of the interior 
highlands, especially in the northern and western portions of 
the province of St. Paul, and the Sertao of St. Francisco. 
According to this current report, the district here mentioned 
is even yet inhabited by a very large ape, to which the In- 
dians (from whom the report comes), have given the name 
of Caypore, which signifies the dweller in the wood. The 
Caypore is said to be as big as a man, and covered over its 
entire body and a portion of its face with very long curly 
hair. Its colour is brown, with the exception of a white

316 VIEW OF THE EXTINCT FAUNA OF BEAZIL. 

mark on the belly, immediately above the navel. It climbs 
up trees with facility, but most frequently keeps to the ground, 
where it walks upright like a man. While young it is a quiet, 
inoffensive creature, living upon fruits, and its teeth are shaped 
like the human ; but as it increases in age, it becomes rapa- 
cious and bloodthirsty ; it takes to chasing birds and small 
mammals ; huge canine teeth project from its mouth, and it 
is dangerous even to man. Its skin is impenetrable to ball, 
everywhere except the white mark on its belly. The natives 
dread this animal, and avoid the spots it frequents, which 
are rendered evident by the Caypore's characteristic footmark ; 
for, according to this same tradition, its foot is not formed 
like that of man, but ends in a heel, both before and behind, 
so that it is impossible to know^ in which direction the ani- 
mal has gone. It is easy to recognize in many of the traits 
of this mysterious creature's natural history, the childish em- 
bellishments of a savage race. The meaning of an anterior 
heel is evidently this ; that the forepart of the foot is not 
broader than the hind, and that the impressions of the toes 
are not distinguishable. As to the white spot on the belly, 
I must remark that all the long-haired apes, now found here, 
have the central part of the belly very thinly covered with 
hair, so that when the hair is of a dark colour, and the skin 
light, an effect is produced during the act of respiration, as 
if there were a white spot on the stomach. The impene- 
trability of its hide may seem fabulous ; but I really am 
acquainted with a species of this family, the Guigo {Mycetes 
crinicaffdus, mihi) , which has this property. This undescribed 
animal (which constitutes a remarkable link between Mycetes 
and Cehus, inasmuch as it combines the vocal organs of the 
former with the perfectly hairy tail of the latter), is provided 
with a skin clothed with such long and felted hair, as to be 
proof against shot on its back and sides. It would seem to 
be well aware of its good buckler ; for instead of seeking 
safety in flight, like other apes, on the approach of danger, 
it rolls itself up in a ball, as if to cover the part least pro- 
tected with hair, and thus bids defiance to the hunter's shot. 
I have introduced this tradition, less on account of its zoo- 
logical interest, than for the striking coincidence it displays 
in many points with the stories related of the Pongo of Bor- 
neo. If no such animal exists in the district where this tra- 
dition is current, whence did it arise ? Is it possible that the 
Indians have received it from their forefathers ? And may 
this tradition then be considered as one more testimony to 
the Asiatic origin of the first inhabitants of America } T 
have given this tradition as it is told by the Indians of the

province of St. Paul. In the Sertao of S. Francisco, it is 
coupled with additions which weaken its zoological interest, 
but give it another, as betraying the only trace 1 have met 
with in this district, of a belief in fairy beings. According 
to the natives of Sertao, the Caypore is lord over the wild 
hogs ; and sometimes when one of these animals has been 
shot, the voice of the enraged Caypore is heard in the dis- 
tance, and the hunter at once quits his prey to save himself 
by flight. The Caypore is said to have been seen in the 
centre of a herd of swine, riding on the biggest : and indeed 
has been sometimes described as a sort of Suscentaur, that 
is, an ape above, and a hog below. 

[This paper is rendered somewhat obscure from the circumstance that 
the author mentions the same animal, in some instances, under two or 
three different names, and he occasionally uses as generic terms, the names 
by which certain species are known in their native country. The Capivar 
is the Hydrochcerus Capyhara of most systematic works ; the Paca is the 
Coilogenys suhniger of authors ; Cutia, is generally used in the paper for 
the genus Dasyprocta ; by Perea, is meant the Cavia Aperea or *Cavia 
Cobaya. Synetheres and Bchimys are systematic names, and have the ad- 
vantage of being intelligible. The local names being spelt in all manner 
of ways, and often very numerous, are difficult to recollect.]

Art. III. — On the Variation of Colour in Wild Plants. 
By Arthur Adams, Esq. 

Varieties among the plants cultivated in our gardens, where 
they are exposed to every unnatural influence which the in- 
genuity of man has invented, to divert them from their usual 
mode of growth, have received all the attention so wonderful 
and interesting a subject demanded at the hands of the culti- 
vators of Botany. But even among those lovely productions 
whose only nurse is the gentle Flora, we occasionally meet 
with aberrations from the normal structure, departures from 
the laws that ordinarily govern the world of vegetables. Of 
these, the most numerous are alterations in the colouring of 
the floral envelopes, and deserve our consideration. 

The causes which give rise to, and modify the production of 



326 VARIATION OF COLOUR IN WILD PLANTS. 

colour in plants, and which dispose their tints to arrange them- 
selves in a determinate manner, are for the most part still very 
obscure. We know that however diversified the tints of a 
flower may be, yet there is, in reality, no actual intermixture 
of colour ; each hue is pure, distinct in itself, and accurately 
defined, although they frequently deliciously harmonize and 
soften into one another : take, for instance, a petal of the 
tulip, or the party-coloured ranunculus of our gardens, where 
the distinctions of tint are beautifully seen. Here we should 
find, on a minute examination, that their brilliant and varied 
hues are owing to the deposition of a colouring matter on the 
inside of the cellules, of which their tissue is composed. The 
tissue, being colourless and transparent, allows the colouring 
matter to shine through it, and produce the dazzling effect 
we witness. It appears, however, now, to be pretty well as- 
certained, from the researches of Macaire, that all the various 
colours of flowers may, for the most part, be ascribed to dif- 
ferent degrees of oxygenation of the chromule, or colouring 
matter contained in the vesicles of which they are composed. 
Why green should be the colour chiefly confined to the fo- 
liage of plants, and various other colours to the petals, which 
are constructed on precisely the same plan, seems not yet de- 
termined. It is curious to observe, however, what a striking 
tendency various parts, in the neighbourhood of the floral 
leaves, have to clothe themselves also in " coats of many 
colours." The calyx of the Fuchsia, for instance, is of a 
bright scarlet, and the bracts of the Hydrangea are often 
blue. The oxygenation of which we before spoke, appears 
to be effected by the agency of solar light ; and it may be 
stated as a general rule, that the brightness of colour in 
plants is in the direct ratio of the amount of solar light to 
which they are exposed. The changes of colour which the 
leaves of different plants assume as autumn approaches ; — the 
red dress, for example, in which the goddess of Botany, at 
that period, clothes the pear, the vine, the sumach, and Vir- 
ginian creeper ; — has been ascribed by Macaire to the same 
oxydising effect already mentioned. 

Schubler and Funk divide the colours of flowers into two 
classes, the Oxydised (Xanthic of De Candolle), and the 
Disoxydised (Cyanic of De Candolle). The first, or Xanthic 
class, has yellow for its type, and the flowers belonging to 
this series are capable of passing into red or white, but, ac- 
cording to those authors, never into blue. To this statement, 
however, there are certainly some exceptions. Viola lutea, 
for example, has been observed, both by myself and Mr. 
Moore, of York, with yellow and purple, or wholly purple,

flowers ; and Myosotis palustris has both yellow and blue 
flowers. My friend Mr. Dickson, of Jersey, has also found 
a specimen of (Enothera biennis, with eight flowers on it ; 
six of the usual yellow colour, one purple, and the other 
blue. The second, or Cyanic class, has blue for its type, 
which can pass into red or white, but never into yellow, 
Schubler and Funk consider green as a sort of neutral colour, 
intermediate between these two classes. Most purple or 
blue flowers may have red or white varieties ; rose-coloured 
flowers seem the next most liable to variation ; while yellow 
rarely change : Glaucium luteum has been gathered, how- 
ever, by Mr. Dickson, with flowers of a white colour ; and 
several other varieties in this type of colour have already 
been mentioned. The cause of the non-oxygenation of white 
varieties is not well understood. It cannot be ascribed to 
the absence of solar light, as many of them are found grow- 
ing in very exposed situations : nor are the subjects of this 
variation weakly and frail, like plants that have been submitted 
to the process of blanching. It cannot be owing to the same 
cause that produces a white colour in many animals of the 
northern regions, namely cold,, as many of these white speci- 
mens are found in the summer, and all of those mentioned by 
us, were observed in the mild temperature of the British Is- 
lands. We are constrained, therefore, to assign them to cer- 
tain unknown causes, which induce in the floral envelopes of 
X)lants a white colour, perhaps somewhat analogous to those 
which produce albinoism in the animal kingdom. 

The following white varieties met with in wild British plants, 
belong to the Cyanic series ofDe Candolle ; that is, their flo- 
ral envelopes are naturally coloured blue, rose-coloured, or 
purple. They have been observed both by myself, and also 
by Mr. O. A. Moore, of York. I have thought it better to 
throw the plants into their natural orders : — 1. Ranunculacese, 
Ranunculus Flammula ; Anemone nemorosa (every stage, 
from purple to white). — 2. Yiolaceae, Viola odorata (various 
shades from dark blue to white). — Polygalaceae, Poly gala vul- 
garis (also pink). — 4. Caryophyllacese, Lychnis dioica (red, 
rose-coloured, and white). — 5. Geraniacese, Geranium pra- 
tense ; G. phceum ; Erodium cicutarium.^ ' — 6. Ericaceae, 
Menziesia polifolia ;* Andromeda polif alia ;* EricaTetralia:; 
Callutia vulgaris. — 7. Leguminacese, Ononis arvensis ; Tri- 
folium pratense. — 8. Rosacea?, Geumrivale (also yellow). — 9. 
Circseacese, Circcsa lutetiana (white and pale red). — 10. Me-

and abortive). — 11. Boraginacea3, Myosotis palustris; Pul- 
monaria officinalis.^ — 12. Labiaceae, Lamium maculaium ; 
L. intermedium ;* Betonica officinalis f' Galeopsis Tetrahit; 
Ballota nigra; Origanum vulgar e.^ — 13. Apocynaceae,

nosa.^ — 15. Convolvulaceae, Convolvulus arvensis. — 16. So- 
lanaceae, Solanum Dulcamara ; Atropa Belladonna (gathered 
in Netley Abbey, by Mr. Dickson, of a dirty white colour). 
— 17. Gentianaceae, Gentiana verna ;* G. PneumonantheJ^ 
— 18. Scrophulariaceae, Digitalis purpurea (common in gar- 
dens, of a white colour ; we have also found it in Hampshire, 
wild, in that state). — 19. Campanulaceae, Campanula rotun- 
difolia. — 20. Compositae, Cnicus palustris ;* Centaurea 
Cyanus (every shade of blue and pink, to pure white). — 21. 
Orchidaceae, Orchis maculata. — 22. Araceas, Arum macula- 
turn (yellowish or purple, white, spotted, and without spots). 
— 23. Polygonaceae, Polygonum Persicaria. I shall add a few 
more varieties that influence the colour of wild flowers, 
equally interesting : — Crataegus Oxyacantha, naturally white, 
(rose-colour) ; Oxalis Acetosella, naturally lilac, (blood-red) ; 
Scrophularia nodosa, naturally purple, (green) ; Anagallis 
arvensis, naturally scarlet, (white); Jasione montana,ndX\xxdi\\j 
blue, (dark purple) ; Viola lutea, naturally yellow, (purple). 

While I am on the subject of varieties in wild plants, 
perhaps a few remarks on those aberrations in their form and 
mode of growth, which I have observed, may not prove un- 
acceptable to those who give this notice a perusal. 

The development of the flowers of plants in a wild state 
is sometimes irregular, either on account of abortion of some 
of their parts, their exuberant growth, or from certain other 
causes not well understood. Linaria vulgaris, naturally a 
labiate flower, is reduced, for instance, in one variety, to a 
regular form, where the corolla is regular, five-cleft, with five 
spurs, and where there are five equal stamens. This is owing 
to the circumstance of two of the petals, which are usually 
suppressed, attaining a development equal to the other three. 
In Geum rivale, also, the axis of growth is sometimes found 
prolonged beyond the petals ; and the flowers of Festuca 
vivipara, Bellis perennis, and Polygonum viviparum, are 
often proliferous. Varieties and transformations among the 
foliage of plants, are innumerable. Fraxinus heterophylla 
has leaves, ternate, simple, serrated, and compound ; Paris 
quadrifolia has often three, five, and even six leaves in a 
whorl, although, as indeed is indicated by the specific name, 
four is the normal number. The leaves oi' Ranunculus aqua-

tilis, and Polygonum amphihium^ vary in a remarkable man- 
ner, according as they grow in or out of the water. Solanum 
Dulcamara and Clematis Vitalba are very variable as re- 
gards their leaves. In Hellehorus foetidus, the leaflets are 
sometimes joined together, forming one large and undivided 
leaf. Spotted leaves are sometimes seen in Hieracium syl- 
vaticum,Hier.murorum^Arurn maculatum, iMmium interme- 
dium^ &c. Besides these, there are numerous other interest- 
ing varieties to be met with in the vegetable kingdom, an 
enquiry into which would amply repay the labour expended

By Sir Edw. Ff. Bromhead, Bt, F.R.S., Lend, and Ed. 

Perleb's ' Clavis' appeared in 1838, and must be considered 
a work of very great value ; no Scientific History of the 
Higher Botany can pass over his large contributions towards 
the natural grouping of the families. He refers to his ' Lehr- 
buch,' published as early as 1826, indicating by a mark (f)' 
the additions made in the * Clavis,' and he complains that 
Burmeister, in his * Handbuch,' adopts thirty-three out of 
forty-four from his groups, without once naming the * Lehr- 
buch' or its author. This is unquestionably true, and few 
writers have such just grounds for complaint against his suc- 
cessors, as Perleb ; but Burmeister's work is a general digest 
of the whole of Natural History, and does not profess to 
adjudicate authorship, even in the families, as monographs 
and systems should do ; neither does it servdlely copy Per- 
leb, but freely deviates, sometimes for the worse, oftener for 
the better. Lindley also, Endlicher, and indeed almost all 
writers, except Perleb himself and Meisner, omit the found- 
ers and synonymes of the Botanical Alliances ; an omission 
partially supplied in * Phil. Mag.,' Sept., 1837, and to which 
some additions are now made from Perleb and Burmeister. 

In the ' Clavis' are several matters worthy of imitation. 
In page 8, he gives a Table of Abbreviations, used for indi- 
cating the Authors of genera, &c. Such a Table, constructed 
on uniform stenographic principles, and uniformly carried 
through a Botanical Conspectus, would add greatly to the 
clearness, brevity, and symmetry of the whole ; it should, 
moreover, enable us to ascertain by suitable marks, not merely 

Ml is substituted here. * 



330 REMARKS ON THE 

the originator of the Name, but the real Author of the assem- 
blage, whether produced as a section or otherwise, and also 
the writers who afterwards correctly limited the assemblage. 
Striking injustice has been committed on these points, and 
is properly complained of by Agardh ; the priority even of 
Name, is still extensively violated, nor can Linnaeus always 
escape that censure, in having acted under colour of arbitrary 
rules, made imperative and retrospective, instead of being 
recommended for future adoption. The spirit of equity, and 
the labour of Reichenbach, in matters of Nomenclature, merit 
all praise. 

In page 46, Perleb gives a useful Table of the Names and 
Synonymes of Tribes, Families, &c. To such, the rules of 
priority cannot so conveniently apply, the divisions being 
properly provisional, and it being possible hereafter to con- 
struct a Nomenclature on some fixed principle, so as to indi- 
cate the dignity of the assemblage by its termination, and its 
place by the name of a genus. These advantages the names 
of Genera cannot possess, unless some bold speculator shall 
hereafter reduce to uniformity, the teraiinations of all genera 
within the same family. 

At page 52, there is an Index of Genera, referring (from 
the nature of the work), not to the page, but by number to 
the Family in which that genus lies. Every Conspectus 
should contain a double Index, one of the Tribes, with a refer- 
ence to the page of the work, — the other of the Genera, each 
followed by the name of the Tribe in which the genus lies. 
This list of genera would suit every edition and every work, 
would avoid incredible labour and endless errata, and would 
directly supply, in most cases, without further search or trou- 
ble, all that the reader requires. Some additional space 
might be required, but small type is scarcely objectionable in 
cases of mere occasional reference. 

Perleb uses the words ' Class' and * Order' (terms correctly 
applicable to artificial systems), to indicate his Primary Divi- 
sions, and the Alliances which they contain. His Classes are 
neatly named and set out, but do not differ materially from 
those of his predecessors : — 

Protophyta. — Cellulares Apliyllae. 

Muscos-ffi. — Foliosae. 

FiLiciNJ5. — Vasculares EnclogenaB Cryptogamicae. 

Ternari^. — Phanerogaraicae. 

MoNOCHLAMYDE^. • Exogenffi Incompletae. 

THALAMANTHiE. — Monopctalae. 



CALYCANTHiE.- 

CalycopetaljE. — Pleiopetalae. 

Thalamopetal^. 



BOTANICAL SYSTEM OF PROFESSOR PERLEB. 331 

As to the above Scheme, it is quite certain, that Ternaries 
are out of place. They should follow Thalamopetalce : The 
Filicinde are not Endogenous, as supposed by some, and 
should be immediately followed by the Gymnosperms and 
Amentace(B ; Cycadacecd resemble Palms in the mere trivial 
circumstance of being unigemmate. — The MonocJilamydece 
seem to be composed of two Sections, lying widely apart, 
and normally distinguished by Burmeister and others as, 

Apetalse diclineae lepidanthse, 
Apetalae monoclineae chromaiithae. 

The succession would also be more natural on the whole, if 
the Calycopetaldd included Families with a Disk round the 
Ovary, whether the Disk adheres to the Calyx, or rises freely 
from the Torus ; and if, moreover, the Class, so modified, 
stood between the two Apetalous classes, thus : — 

Protophyta; Monopetalae tlialamantlia? ; 

Muscosae ; Monopetalae calycanthae ; 

Filicinae ; Thalamopetalae ; 

Apetalae diclineae lepidanthae ; Ternarise ; 

Peridiscanthese ; Rliizantheae. 
Apetalae monoclineae chromanthae ; 

This arrangement (as not consisting of two parallel series), 
cannot place all the Alliances in immediate natural sequence, 
but may present a series always either connected, or closely 
analogous. 

Perleb's Table of Classes is followed by a Table of his 
Orders or Alliances, with their several distinctive characters ; 
the Families are then tabulated in the same manner, with their 
differential characters, under their respective Alliances. The 
whole exhibits great precision and extensive powers of gene- 
ralization, and wall amply repay a careful examination ; but 
I cannot venture here to do more than exhibit those cases, 
in which Perleb seems entitled to be quoted as the founder, 
or among the Synonymes of the Alliances. The writer, who 
has assembled more than half (say three out of five) of the 
families of an Alliance, ought to be deemed the founder, un- 
less its distinctive aspect is lost in the crowd of spurious^ 
additions. 

Such additional Synonymes as I have met with since the 
former publication, and some which have arisen from dividing 
a few of the larger alliances (chiefly the Cellular es^, into 
others of less extent, may be laid hereafter before your read- 
ers. — With the view of comparison, my own Table is sub-

cluded in Sanguisorbaceae. — The RosACEiE § 2 (stipulate, 
&c.) of Burmeister are Chrysohalanece-amygdalecB, Pomacece, 
SpirwacecB {^nnaneCj-rosecB-potentillecB, Sanguisorbece. 

Saxifra GALES, PoRTULACALES. — Under SUCCULENT.E Linn. 
e. e. Pb., Perleb includes the greater part of the Saxifragales 
and Portulacales loosely arranged. He omits Bruniaceae, 
Fouquieraceae, Silenaceae ; he adds Stackhousieae, Halorageae ; 
among his sequences are CrassulacecB, Ficoidece, Portulaceae, 
IllecebrecB ; Stackhousieae, Philadelpheae, Galacineae are

nopodiece, PhytolaccecB, Amarantacece, Paronychieae, Scle- 
rantheae, Polygonem. 

Polemoniales. — Perleb, under his Lurid^, throws toge- 
ther (unnamed) Cobceacece, Polemoniece, WHydroleacece, as 
" Corolla non plicata, embr. recto, corolla ad faucem non 
squamigera." 

Gentianales-Apocynales. — Perleb unites these, loosely 
arranged, under the name PiCROCHYLEiE, omitting (probably 
well) Lygodysodea. 

Cinchonales-Sambucales. — Perleb gives Rigid^ Batsch. 
c. add. Ph., as containing Steltatce, Coffeacece, Cinchona- 
cew, Cephalanihecd, LonicerecB, SamhucincB.

aquatica), palustres :" — ? || Sarraceniaceaj, NymphadacecB, Ne- 
lumhonece, \\ Cahomhece, Podophyllece. To these are added, 
without arrangement, the Menispermales, mixed with Ranun- 
culaceae, Magnoliacea?, and Dilleniacea?. 

Agrostidales. — The arrangement of the characters of 
Perleb's Glumace^e, throws together (unnamed) Cyperace(B, 
Gramine(B^ " Staminibus pistillo non junctis, perigonio glu- 
maceo, planta? culmiferge pique, herbacea), fol. alt. simpl. in- 
tegerr. parallelinerv. vaginant., ovar. — 1-ovulat., ovariis solita- 
riis." — Burmeister's Monosperm^e (bracteatae glumaceae) take 
the same range. 

Arecales. — Perleb adopts the Palmjs of Linnaeus, divid- 
ing them into six families. Linnaeus left the Palms as a 
natural group, wdiich he was unable to distribute under his 
artificial system ; Botany would have presented a very dif- 
ferent aspect, had he, on the contrary, delivered his artificial 
system as a supplement to contain plants, which he could 
not form into such natural groups as the Labiatae, Cruciferae, 
Umbelliferae, Leguminosae, &c. 

Typhales. — Perleb includes under Spadicin^e Ag. c. add. 
PZ>., ^Phytelephantece, Pandanece, Typhacecs^ WAcoroidecie,

SpADiciNiE Fluviales of Burmeistcr are Aroidem {Acorus), 
Typhoidece, Potamophilce, Lemnace<£. 

Race of the Fungi. 

Auriculariales. — Perleb adopts the Hymenomycetes 
Fr. (olim). Fries, in his 'Epicrisis,' 1838, removes theElvel- 
laceae, under the name of Discomycetes, from this alliance, 
and stations them next to Pyrenomycetes. — Von Martius 
opens his system with the Algae, and terminates it with the 
Fungi, as Vegetatio secundaria. 

Lycoperdales. — Perleb, for the purpose of distinguishing 



334 REMARKS ON THE 

the characters of Fungi, places together (unnamed) the Gas- 
TEROMYCETES, Fr., and Pyrenomycetes, Fr, : " E pcridiis

diaceae, Thymelcem, WElaeagnece, Santalaceas, Olacinece ; 
including the whole Elceagnales, and substantially the Lau- 
rales intermixed. — ||The Chenopodiales and Elceagnales form 
the passage to the MoNOPETALiE, through MirabiliacecB and 
OlacacecB, and here we must ascertain the true nature of the 
Monopetalous Structure. It would seem, that in the progress 
of development, the outer envelopes assume the functions of 
the inner, which disappear ; the Calyx becomes Corolla, and

ON SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. 339 

Art. V. — Remarks on the Theory of Spontaneous Generation. 
By Mr. J. B. Bladon. 

( Continued from page 286.^ 

In a satirical rhapsody published in the latter part of the 
seventeenth century, entitled " The History of the World of 
the Sun," there is such a plain, unvarnished description of 
the doctrine of spontaneous generation, that I cannot forbear 
to transcribe it. The voyager having arrived at one of the 
dark spots observable on the sun, meets with a personage 
who instructs him in several branches of knowledge, among 
others is the following upon creation : " Consider well the 
ground whereon we stand ; it is not long since it was an in- 
digested disorderly mass, a chaos of confused matter, whereof 
the sun had purged himself. Now, after that, by the force 
of its rays, which the sun darted against it, he mingled, 
pressed, and compacted those numerous clouds of atoms, 
after, I say, that by a long and powerM coction, he sepa- 
rated the more contrary, and reverted the more similary parts 
of this bowl, the mass, pierced through with heat, sweat so 
that it made a deluge, which covered it above forty days ; 
for so much water required no less time to fall down into the 

more declining and lower regions of the globe." " When 

the waters were retired, a fat and fertile mud remained upon 
the earth. Now, when the sun shone out, there arose a 
kind of tumour, or wheal, which could not, because of the 
cold, thrust out its bud ; it therefore received another coction, 
and that coction still rectifying and perfecting it by a more 
exact mixture, it sent forth a sprout, endowed then only with 
vegetation, but capable of sense ; but because the waters 
which had so long stood upon the slime had too much 
chilled it, the swelling broke not, so that the sun recocted it 
once more ; and after a third digestion, that matrix being so 
thoroughly heated, that the cold brought forth a man, who 
hath retained in the liver, which is the seat of the vegetative 
soul, and the place of the first concoction, the power of 
growing; in the heart, which is the seat of activity and the 
place of the second concoction, the vital powers ; and in the 
brain, which is the seat of the intellectual, and the place of 
the third concoction, the power of reasoning." " Never- 
theless, you'll tell me there is no man in your world engen- 
dered of mud, and produced in that manner. I believe it ; 
your world is at present overheated ; for so soon as the sun 
draws a sprout out of the earth, finding none of that cold 
humidity, or to say better, that certain period of completed

motion, which obliges it to several coctions, it turns it pre- 
sently to a vegetable, or if it makes two coctions, seeing the 
second has not time enough to receive perfection in, it only 
engenders an insect." We have here the real spirit of the 
doctrine laid bare and open to view in its greatest absurdity; 
and even the most plausible expositions of spontaneous 
generation, have no better foundation on which to take their 
stand ; they are all obliged to have recourse to some assisting 
power to help them out of their difficulties, knowing that if 
they rest their doctrine upon the power of matter, the 
universal experience of all mankind would bely it, they there- 
fore generally, and most wisely, lay it down, that only the 
smaller and more simply organized beings are produced by 
it. The difficulty, then, in refuting it, consists in the greatly 
enhanced difficulties of observation. When we find that per- 
sons of eminent rank in science, are at issue respecting the 
organization of the minute organisms ; — that they cannot coin- 
cide upon what is submitted to the observation of their own 
eyes; — should itnot induce us to hesitate before we assert that 
they are positively exempt from the operation of those laws 
which we find to be universal and absolute in every case of 
an organism that is fully open to our observations in every 
succeeding period of its organization ? There are, no doubt, 
many anomalies in the modus operandi of those laws, but 
one circumstance is always essential, and that is, a typical 
predecessor. It is a most mystical occurrence, not to be ac- 
counted for in our present state of physiological knowledge, 
that an organism should propagate itself by bodily division, 
or that one impregnation should suffice for several successive 
generations of Aphides ; but from some cause not yet known 
(probably from exposure to cold), it requires renovation, 
which is provided for by the last generation always contain- 
ing males. In some instances mentioned in Westwood's 
Introduction, of female moths having fruitful descendants 
without sexual impregnation, the last generation were all 
males ; still they remained true to their type ; even all the 
arts of mankind, exerted upon the most variable species of 
organisms subject to his controul, with all the diversities of 
soil, climate, and culture that exist upon the surface of the 
earth, have been unable to produce a new species ; the most 
plastic still remains true to its type : even when he forcibly 
combines two species, and attempts to produce a compound 
of them, it succeeds not beyond the primary instance, but 
either remains barren, or breeds back to the type of one of 
its parents. Do we notperceive that here is a boundary fixed ? 
Is not here an absolute line of demarcation drawn by some

law fixed by a superintending power, who has declared, thus 
far shalt thou go but no farther? How can we account for it by 
the theory of spontaneous generation, which asserts that life 
and organization is only a dynamic power combined with 
certain imponderables acting upon each other? Here we have 
an organism actually in existence, possessing every function 
essential to life, but not to reproduction of its kind. It is ad- 
mitted by all the advocates of the doctrine, that when an or- 
ganism is brought into existence by the power alluded to, it 
is then complete in its kind, and can take its station among 
its fellow organisms (without further aid from its spontaneous 
generation), to produce its typical descendants ; but we see, 
in the case of hybridism, a direct contradiction of those 
assumed powers.

were about 10 inches long, communicating with the nostrils, 
and opening posteriorly into the pharynx. 

Colour of the head, back, tail, and outside of the pectoral

The under-jaw is the widest, and projects 9 inches beyond 
the point of the upper one. No teeth in either jaw ; the upper 
jaw is furnished with about 250 plates of whalebone (baleen) 
on each side. Point of each jaw rounded ; the muzzle 
longer and much more attenuated than in the genus Balaena ; 
and the plates of whalebone comparatively short, and conse- 
quently of httle or no value as an article of commerce. They 
resemble horn rather than bone, and are tough, flexible, and 
elastic if bent in one du'ection, but brittle, and easily split in 
the other. Their colour blueish-black, and yellowish- white. 
They are fringed at the edges with loose fibres, resembling 
hair or bristles, which serve to entangle and prevent the es- 
cape of the marine insects, zoophytes, Mollusca^ &c., on 
which the animal chiefly subsisted.

The vertebral column consists of sixty bones ; namely, 
7 cervical, 15 dorsal, 16 lumbar, and 22 caudal ; 52 of these 
are strictly spinal, the 53rd doubtfiil, and the remaining 7 
appertain to the horizontal tail. The spinal canal terminates 
at the 52nd; the 53rd has a deep groove, but no spinous pro- 
cess, the arch being completed in the recent subject by car- 
tilage or ligament. 

Each of the principal vertehrcs consists of a body, two 
transverse processes, two oblique or articulating processes, 
and the spinous process, surmounting and completing the 
spinal arch, for the transmission and protection of the me- 
dulla spinalis or spinal marrow.

The ribs are fourteen in number on each side ; the first 
being double-headed, is attached to the two first dorsal ver- 
tehr<B, the rest are each attached to the posterior edge of the 
transverse process of the corresponding dorsal vertebra. 

The pectoral fin, &c., is analogous to the superior extre- 
mity of the human subject, consisting of a scapula, with its 
glenoid cavity, the os humeri, the fore-arm, with its two 
bones [radius and ulna), the carpus, metacarpus of four 
bones and four fingers, with their phalanges. 

The point of the underjaw projects, in the skeleton, one 
foot beyond that of the upper ; they are both pointed, but 
were rounded off in the recent subject. 

Two small flat bones, representing the pelvis in quadru- 
peds, were attached (one on each side) to the first caudal 
vertebra. 

The intervertebral substance consists of myriads of elastic 
columns or pillars ; an admirable and exquisitely beautiful 
piece of mechanism, combining flexibility, elasticity, and 
strength. 

The seven last bones of the vertebral column are deeply 
impressed laterally with pits or hollows, for the attachments 
of the rays or fibres of the horizontal tail. 

From the discrepancy as to the number of vertebrm, &c., 
I am of opinion that this species has not been described 
before, and I have proposed for it the name Balcenoptera 
ienuirostris.

Art. VIT- — Catalogue of the Entozoa indigenous to Ireland ; with

One of the objects contemplated by the Natural-History So- 
ciety of Dublin on its formation, was to obtain, at as early a 
period as circumstances permitted, a complete catalogue of 
the animals, vertebral as well as invertebral, which are natives 
of this country. With the wish to contribute as far as lies in 
my power to so desirable an object, I have brought forward 
the following catalogue of Entozoa, or parasitic animals (a

344 CATALOGUE OF THE ENTOZOA 

part of the invertebral kingdom which has not hitherto en- 
joyed much of the attention of British Zoologists) which 1 
have met with in this country, the great majority of them 
being new to the British fauna ; in order to render it so far a 
perfect list of our indigenous species, I have included a few 
which I have not been so fortunate as to find myself, but 
which have been noticed or described by others, particularly 
by Dr. Drummond, the President of the Belfast Natural-His- 
tory Society, whose talents have already contributed to ad- 
vance more than one branch of Natiu-al History, and who 
has lately turned his attention to these much neglected ani- 
mals, and has described some species altogether new to 
science. 

Under the general name Entozoa (derived fi-om evto? intus, 
^coov animal), are included all the animals which naturally and 
permanently reside in the alimentary canal, or some other 
part of the interior of animals. And although the habitat 
of any animal is not a sufficient ground to separate it from 
the genera or species which approach it in organization, 
yet as the Entozoa have been studied and described as a 
separate group by those naturahsts whose authority upon the 
subject is the highest; and as the majority of them are dis- 
tinct in organization fi:om any animals not parasitic ; and as 
we are as yet far from having arrived at a natural arrange- 
ment of invertebral animals, (there being some groups which 
though not parasitic, require to be associated with the Ento- 
zoa, and others which are parasitic, and which many have 
arranged with these animals, but of which the true situation 
is extremely doubtful) : — it appeared to me to be more pru- 
dent to retain the term in the sense used by Rudolphi and 
Bremser ; and on the present occasion I shall confine my- 
self altogether to the true Entozoa, or those species which in- 
habit some part of the interior of the bodies of other ani- 
mals; and I shall not enter at all upon the disputed point, 
as to the place which these animals ought to occupy, in a 
natural arrangement of the invertebral kingdom. 

The animals included under the term Entozoa, although 
they have been very carefully studied by several continental 
zoologists, and have occupied a considerable share of the 
attention of several distinguished comparative anatomists, 
have from some cause or other been little attended to, I might 
almost say completely overlooked by British natiu'alists, even 
by men distinguished in other departments of the science. 
" While there are some branches of Natural History (as Mr. 
Jenyns has observed in his report on Zoology) which are 
most sedulously cultivated by us, there are others which have 



INDIGENOUS TO IRELAND. 345 

for a long time lain comparatively neglected." This remark 
is peculiarly appropriate, and applies particularly to the ani- 
mals which form the subject of the present communication; 
they are commonly looked upon with disgust instead of any- 
thing of interest in a scientific point of view, and the num- 
ber of individuals who have made them a study is exceed- 
ingly limited. Indeed, the little attention which the Entozoa 
have attracted in these countries will be apparent from the 
fact, that in the only works which contain lists of the Bri- 
tish species, viz. * Pennant's Zoology ' and Turton's ' British 
Fauna,' but twenty-eight species are described as indigenous ; 
and four of these are repeated twice under different names, 
leaving but twenty-four distinct species : while in the limited 
opportunities which I have had, I have detected and pre- 
served upwards of 200 species, and several of these occui*red 
in six, others in ten, and one species in as many as fifteen 
different animals. 

The Entozoa, although they do not form a veiy numerous 
division of the animal kingdom, are very extensively distri- 
buted, as in almost all the Mammalia, birds, reptiles, and 
fish, which I have examined, I have detected some species, 
and often more than one ; and there is scarcely a tissue or 
organ in which they do not sometimes occur. 

I have found them in the oesophagus, stomach, and intes- 
tines, in the bronchial tubes, and air cells of the lungs of 
some animals ; in the urinary bladder, in the gall and swim 
bladder of others ; in cellular tissue and in serous membranes ; 
in the substance of the heart, in the liver and kidney ; some 
species inhabit the brain of animals, others their eyes, others 
aneurismal swellings of arteries, others the meatus audito- 
rius, the frontal and maxillary sinuses, and even the cavity 
of the tympanum. In fact there is hardly an organ in which 
some species has not been detected, at least among vertebral 
animals ; and if they are more rare among the Invertehrata, 
it is, perhaps, because we have not yet sufficiently sought for 
them. 

The number of animals which I have dissected in order to 
complete this list, is very considerable : I possess notes of 
having examined upwards of 270 Mammalia, 360 birds, and 
380 fish, exclusive of reptiles which are indigenous to this 
country. And here I have much pleasure in acknowledging 
the assistance which I have received from Mr. Richard Glen- 
non, preserver of animals to the Natural-History Society; 
who most obligingly placed at my disposal the body of any 
animal sent to him to be preserved, which I was desirous of 
examining ; indeed, without his kind co-operation, I could 
not have brought this list to its present extent. 



846 CATALOGUE OF THE ENTOZOA 

The classification to which I have adhered in the following 
catalogue, is the one given by Rudolphi in his 'Synopsis,' fol- 
lowed by Bremser in both his works, and adopted by almost 
all zoologists since. I cannot see the necessity for the change 
in the nomenclature of the orders which has been made by 
Mr. Owen, in his article Entozoa, in the ' Cyclopaedia of Ana- 
tomy and Physiology.' Rudolphi's terms are in a gi'eat mea- 
sure estabhshed, having been adopted by almost eveiy writer 
upon the subject since his time ; and if the names of fami- 
lies or orders are to be altered upon trivial grounds, we should 
be under the necessity of giving up many of the names 
which have been longest established ; indeed nothing appears 
to have a greater tendency to retard the study of Natural 
History, than the unnecessary multiplication of names which 
are already too numerous. But in the present instance, I do 
not think the new names are an improvement upon the old, 
the latter appear to me to be more expressive, and their 
having been adopted by the best practical helminthologists 
is a sufficient reason for retaining them here. 

Rudolphi has arranged the Entozoa in five orders of fami- 
lies, each of which includes a larger or smaller number of 
genera. On the present occasion I shall only notice those 
genera in which I have as yet detected species inhabiting 
animals natives of this country. 

Commencing with those most highly organized, they are 
Nematoidea, Acanthocephala, Trematoda, Cestoidea, and 
Cystica. 

Order I. NEMATOIDEA. 

(Derived from vii(/,a JHurrij and £i^og forma.) 

The order Nematoidea includes the Efitozoa whose organ- 
ization is the highest ; the body is cylindrical and elastic, 
more or less attenuated at each extremity; intestinal canal 
complete, provided with a mouth and anus ; sexes distinct ; 
commonly oviparous, rarely viviparous. The head is conti- 
nuous with the body, very rarely separated by a neck, often 
obtuse and sometimes edged by lateral membranes (what 
Rudolphi has called winged). The posterior extremity of 
the body is either sharp or obtuse, often curved. The male 
is almost always smaller than the female, and the penis, which 
is either a single or double spiculum, frequently projects ex- 
ternally. In both sexes the internal organs of generation 
(the ovaries in the female and the seminal tubes in the male), 
are in the form of long filaments, which surround the intes- 



INDIGENOUS TO IRELAND. 347 

tinal canal. The generic characters are taken principally 
from the shape of the mouth, or from the disposition of the tu- 
bercles which sun-ound it ; the absence or presence of lips, &c. 
The genera in this order are found in all classes of ani- 
mals ; they inhabit almost every organ, but most frequently 
the alimentary canal. 



Genus I. — Filaria, 

(Derived from Filum, a thread.) 

Body long, cylindrical, and elastic, nearly of equal diameter throughout; 
mouth orbicular. Male organ a simple spiculum. 

This genus was established by Miiller, and has been 
adopted by Rudolphi ; the species inhabit cellular membrane 
in every part of the body, very rarely the alimentary canal ; 
they are not uncommon in Mainmalia, birds, and fish, they 
are less common in reptiles ; they occur also in invertebral 
animals, particularly in the larva of Lepidoptera, and in 
some Coleoptera. 

The Filaria have been arranged by Rudolphi in two sub- 
divisions, according as the mouth is simple or papillary and 
labiate.

A. This species of Filaria (which does not appear to have been described) 
occurred under the peritonceum of the common red gurnard {Trigla pini.) 
The specimens which I possess are from three to four inches in length, and 
about the thickness of strong thread, the colour white, body cylindrical, 
and of the same diameter throughout. Anterior extremity obtuse and 
rounded, posterior acute. Mouth orbicular and very small. In removing 
them, some ruptured, and allowed the ovaries and intestinal canal to pro- 
trude. 

B. This species (which also appears not to have been described), oc- 
curred in the peritonceum of the common grey mullet {Mugil capita) : they 
were so imbedded in this membrane that it required considerable trouble 
to remove them, and some portion of the membrane continued to adhere 
to them, which rendered their examination difficult ; they are about 4^

Genus 9. —Trichosoma. 

(Derived from Tf <|, capillus.) 

Body cylindrical and elastic, of moderate length, veiy slender towards 
the anterior extremity, and insensibly enlarging posteriorly. Mouth 
terminal, punctiform. Male organ a simple filament contained in a 
sheath. 

This genus was established by Zeder, under the name of 
Capillaria. The species are most common in birds, next in 
the Mammalia ; they are very rare in reptiles and fish ; they 
inhabit the stomach, the small and large intestines, some- 
times the urinary bladder. The species of the genus Tri- 
chosoma are all exceedingly small, and resemble each 
other very closely (almost the only difference being a Httle 
greater or less length or thickness of the body), and as male 
and female are not always found together, it is very difficult 
to determine the species accurately ; in fact, of the twenty- 
two species which Rudolphi has enumerated, sixteen are 
doubtful ; and of thirteen species which I have met with 
nine are doubtful.

the abdomen of the commonhumblehee {Bombus terrestris), and sometimes 
in very large numbers; they lived and moved about in a watch glass con- 
taining water, for a considerable time ; they are cylindrical, some are 
smaller than others, and in these the posterior extremity is very slightly 
curved, in the larger (which probably are females), this part is straight. 
They are so small as to be hardly visible without a lens, and in consequence 
of this I have not been able to succeed in seeing the shape of the mouth ; 
hence they may probably eventually turn out to belong to some other 
genus.

Genus 3. — Trichocephalus. 

(Derived from Tf i|, capillus, and ne^a'hy]^ caput. 

Body cylindrical and elastic, anterior portion capillary and suddenly pass- 
ing into the thicker or posterior part (by this it is distinguished from 
the genus Trichosoma^ in which the increase is very gradual) ; mouth 
orbicular ; penis simple, contained in a sheath. 

The name Tricliocephalus was given to this genus by 
Goetze, and adopted by Rudolphi. It was formerly named 
Trichuris (from t^i^, capillus, and ou^a, cauda), from the 
erroneous supposition that the capillary portion was the tail. 
The species inhabit the large intestines, particularly the ccb- 
cum of the Mammalia ; they do not occur in either birds or 



D. This species of Trichosoma I have very frequently found in the urin- 
ary bladder of the common Norway rat ; in some cases only one or two 
occurred, in others, six, eight, or upwards. Many were free in the blad- 
der ; others so firmly attached by their anterior extremity to the mucous 
membrane, that they broke across when pulled ; and some even remained 
adherent, after having been placed in spirits of wine. They are the largest 
species of Trichosomu which I have seen, the posterior division of the 
body in some being so thick as in a certain degree to resemble this part in 
the Trichocephalus, from which, however, they are readily distinguished, 
the increase in diameter being gradual, and not sudden. They are about 
8 lines in length, the body white and cylindrical, the posterior extremity 
rounded ; in the thicker part of the body, the alimentary canal appears to 
be somewhat spiral, and is surrounded by the convoluted ovaries. All the 
specimens which I have appear to be females. 

This species has not, I believe, hitherto been described, although it is 
very common, and I have frequently met with it. It occurs in the urin- 
ary bladder, both of the male and female rat, and is quite distinct from 
the species which inhabits the small intestine of the same animal. 

From the thickness of the posterior part of the body compared with 
other species of Trichosomxi, I would venture to suggest for this species 
the name Trichosoma crassicauda. 

E. The genus Trichosoma is very rare in fish ; Rudolphi or Bremser 
have never found them ; the only species which has been as yet described 
to occur in these animals, is one noticed by Creplin, in his ' Observationes 
de Entozois.' This species I found in the intestines of the hake (Merluccius 
vulgaris) ; the longest specimen is upwards of an inch in length, the body 
slender, colour perfectly white. As there cannot be a doubt that it is a 
new species, I would venture to suggest the name Trichosoma gracilis fox it.

The genus Oxyurus was established by Rudolphi ; it con- 
tains a very small number of species, only three being enu- 
merated by Rudolphi in his ' Synopsis.' The species inhabit 
the large intestines of the Mammalia^ and have not been 
found in either birds^ reptiles, or fish.

F. The Triehoeephalus dispar has been longer known than any other 
species in the genus ; and although stated by several writers to be rare in 
these countries, in the course of my experience Ihavefo^ind it by far the 
most common species inhabiting the alimentary canal of the human sub- 
ject : I have examined the intestinal canal of eighty-six individuals, who 
died in St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, of various diseases, and whose ages 
varied from three years to seventy; and in seventy-seven out of the eighty-six, 
I found a larger or smaller number of this species ; sometimes only one or two 
existed, sometimes they were in considerable plenty; the largest number I 
have met with in the same individual, was one hundred and nineteen : 
sometimes they were attached to the mucous membrane, more commonly 
they were free ; they almost always inhabited the large intestine, particu- 
larly the ccecum ; I have, however, met with them in the small intestine. 
The male appears to be as common, or perhaps more common, than the 
female, which is contrary to what happens in most other genera of Nema- 
toidea. 

G. This species resembles pretty closely the Triehoeephalus dispar ; the 
capillary portion of the animal is, however, a little longer, and the sheath 
of the penis has a somewhat different shape from what it has in that spe- 
cies. 

H. The Oxyurus curvula is noticed in Pennant's British Zoology, under 
the name of Triehoeephalus equi ; it is the largest species of the genus, 
inhabiting the great intestine of the horse, and is not at all uncommon.

of the common wild rabbit ; the females are double the length of the

Genus 5. — Cucullanus. 

(Derived from Cucullus, a hood.) 

Body cylindrical and elastic, obtuse anteriorly, more attenuated posteriorly; 
mouth orbicular ; head provided with a striated cucullus (from which 
circumstance the genus has been named) ; anus terminal ; orifice of 
female organs a little behind the centre of the body; male organ a 
double spiculum ; all the species viviparous. 

The name Cucullus was given to this genus by Mliller ; the 
species inhabit the alimentary canal offish, and do not occur 
in either Mammalia or birds.

males, and much more numerous. The mouth is orbicular, and every 
small ; on each side of the head is a transparent membrane, somewhat 
resembling that of the Ascaris vermicularis. 

K. The Cucullanus elegans is very common in the perch, occurring in 
the stomach, intestines, and pyloric appendages. The species is vivipa- 
rous, as when some of the females have been accidentally cut across, I 
have seen the young come out in great numbers, and move about freely in 
water placed in a watch-glass. 

The Cucullanus elegans is more rarely met with in the eel than in the 
perch ; sometimes they were free in the intestinal canal, at others, attached 
to the mucous membrane, almost as firmly as Echinorhynchi. They were 
of a reddish colour, the head a deeper red than the body ; after remaining 
in water for some time, every part became white except the head. 

The female Cucullanus elegans from the eel is about 4|^ lines in length, 
the male about 2 lines. The head is rounded, and is pretty accurately 
represented in the magnified figure in Bremser's large work. The strice 
upon the cucullus are numerous and run longitudinally ; the mouth is or- 
bicular, in some a ^xadM papilla projected ; the cesophagus is narrow at its 
commencement, and runs in a straight line to the stomach, which is some- 
what oblong and double the diameter of the cesophagus; the intestine 
is straight, the anus is situated near the posterior extremity. The vulva 
in the female is conspicuous, projecting, seated nearer the caudal than the 
anterior extremity of the body ; the penis of the male (in the specimens 
which I met with), did not project externally. In the female, the caudal 
extremity is rather sharp, not obtuse as Rudolphi describes it to be ; it is 
straight in the female, inflexed in the male. 

L. The Cucullanus foveolatus from the plaice, in some instances, adhered 
firmly to the mucous membrane of the intestine ; very soon after being 
placed in water, the integuments ruptured and allowed the ovaries, &c. to 
protrude. I have not observed that this species is viviparous. 



352 NEW GENUS OF ENCRINITES. 



Art. VIII. — On a recent species of Crinoidea, or Encrinites, con- 
stituting the type of a new genus; — Holopus.' 

M. Alcide D'Orbigny, in a paper read before the 'Academic 
des Sciences,' at their sitting of February 27th, 1837, has de- 
scribed a new genus of radiated animals, so interesting both 
to the zoologist and geologist, that we have been tempted to 
extract the descriptive portion of his paper from M. Guerin's 
' Magasin de Zoologie' (where it is published), and to have 
his plate engraved for our 'Illustrations.' 

The animal in question belongs to that section of the Ra- 
diata, the species of which being destitute of the means of 
locomotion, remain fixed to the ground ; and is allied to the 
Petitacrinus europcBus, first described by Mr. Thompson:^ 
but differing in certain particulars from that species, M. D'Or- 
bigny has been induced to constitute it a new genus, to which 
he applies the name Holopus. The species is dedicated to 
M. Rang, who discovered it at Martinico.

Description. — External parts. ~-^ooi GxAdJ^adi, not ramose, 
smooth, or but slightly marked beneath with intersecting 
lines, which are irregular on its margins, and assume on the 
under parts the form of the body on which the animal is fix-

small rounded tubercles, which are most distinct on its angles ;

The CucuUanus foveolatus from the dab is perfectly white, of equal 
diameter throughout, except at the extremities. The females are from 
6 to 6i lines in length, the males rather less; the anterior extremity is 
obtuse, the posterior acute in both sexes ; the caudal extremity in the fe- 
male is straight, incurved in the male. The oesophagus is longer and wider 
than the stomach, it contracts suddenly where it joins the latter organ, the 
stomach is cylindrical, the anus in the female is close to the caudal extre- 
mity, in the male it is a little more anterior, and projects considerably; 
the oritice by which the penis protrudes, is seated between the anus and 
the caudal extremity. The penis is a double spiculum, very sharp, fine 
and white ; the vulva in the female is situated nearer the caudal than the 
anterior extremity. Several of the females, after remaining for a short 
time in water (in which they at first moved about but soon died), ruptured, 
and the intestine and ovaries protruded.

in number, each formed at its base of a thick pentagonal plate, 
which is concave and irregular on the inner side, convex, and 
externally foiming a thick, nipple-like tubercle, the margins 
of which, flattened at their junction with the three other si- 
milar pieces, are united in a compact manner. On the upper 
portion of the first piece, which has two angles, each arm be- 
comes dichotomous; there are therefore eight arms, which 
are thick, strong, conical, almost twice as long as the foot, 
rounded and tuberculated on their mesial portion, and as it 
were festooned on their outer margins, alternate,' and com- 
pressed at their extremity, composed of calcareous pieces, 
which are thick, and twenty-five in number, each piece bear- 
ing alternately right and left, a conical ramule, which is elon- 
gated, much compressed, rugose externally, somewhat concave 
inteiTially, and formed of many quadrangular pieces joined 
together. 

Internal parts. — The cavity which occupies the whole ex- 
tent of the foot or body, no doubt contained the viscera.^ — 
Mouth (as well as the anus) protected by four moveable, an- 
gular, stony pieces, which close the opening at the will of the 
animal ; it opens into a vestibule, which is dilated in the up- 
per portion of the body, separated by some ciliated and irre- 
gular excrescences at the base of the arm from a large funnel, 
formed of four deep grooves, each dividing into two ; these 
are continued, though less distinctly, throughout the whole 
extent of the inner side of the arm. 

Colouring. — The general tint of the dried animal is green- 
ish, almost black on the body, and paler on the arms and root. 

Dimensions. — The specimen described measured eight cen- 
timetres (three inches and two lines English measure) in total 
length : the foot is 10 J lines ; height of the root, 4f lines ; 
diameter of root at the base, 8|^ lines ; diameter of the foot, 
6 j- lines. 



' As the animal came into our possession in a dried state, it was impos- 
sible to study the conformation of these parts. 



354 NEW SPECIES OF CARABIDEOUS INSECTS. 



Art. IX. — Descriptions of some new species of Carabideous In- 
sects, from the collection made by C, Darwin, Esq., in the South- 
ern parts of S. America. By G. R. Waterhouse, Esq., Curator 
and Assistant Secretary to the Zoological Society. 

The insects I am about to describe belong to that great group 
of Carahid(B to which Dejean applies the name Feroniens, 
and to a section of that group, the species of which are dis- 
tinguished by there being a kind of peduncle separating the 
thorax from the body, — giving to them a superficial resem- 
blance to the ScaritidcB. This constricted portion between 
the thorax and abdomen is formed above by a produced por- 
tion of the elytra, which become suddenly narrow^ in front, 
and form, together with a portion of the mesothorax, a cylin- 
drical neck, which apparently serves to give greater freedom 
of motion to the fore part of the insect. Broscus cephalotes 
affords an example of this group in which Miscodera, Sto- 
mis, Cnemacanthiis^ of Gray (which is the Proniecoderus of 
Dejean), and Baripus, may also be included. These insects 
are most of them remarkable for the convex form of the tho- 
rax and elytra, the want of produced posterior angles to the 
latter, which is usually almost destitute' of posterior fovecB, 
and dilated lateral margins — the dorsal channel moreover is 
generally very indistinct. In these respects the present group 
of insects affords a strong contrast to the more typical Fero- 
nice, if we may regard the species belonging to the genera 
Pterostichus and Omaseus as such. 

In addition to the several genera (allied as it appears to me 
to Broscus) already mentioned, we are indebted to Mr. Cur- 
tis for the knowledge of three others possessing the same 
essential characters. I allude to the genera Odontoscelis, 
Cardiophthalmus and Cascellius, published by Mr. Curtis in 
the Linnean Transactions.* 

The genus Odontoscelis, Curtis, is founded upon an insect 
brought by Capt. King from Valparaiso, — an insect which 
I have observed in many of our collections. In the ' Histoire 
Naturelle des Insectes' by MM. Audouin and Brulle^, a se- 
cond species of the same genus is described and figured as an 

> Cnemucanihus gibbosus of Gray appears to me the same as the Prome- 
coderus brunnicornis of Dejean, which is from Van Dieman's Land, and 
perhaps some other parts of Australasia, and not from Africa as has been 
stated. The genus Cnemacanthus of Guerin and Brulle being synonymous 
with Mr. Curtis' genus Odontoscelis^ the species of which are from South 
America, must not be confounded with Cnemacanthus of Gray.

illustration of Mr. Gray's genus Cnemacanthus, whilst in the 
same work will be found a true species of Cnemacanthus de- 
scribed and figured under the name Promecoderus Lottini. ' 

M. Guerin-Meneville, in the ' Magasin de Zoologie,'* also 
figures and describes certain species of Odontoscelis under 
the name of CnemacantJms, but this author perceives that the 
species of Cnemacanthus of the French authors differ in cer- 
tain respects from the type of the genus figured in Griffiths' 
* Animal Kingdom,' inasmuch as they have the anterior tihice 
prolonged externally ; he states however that a small species 
which is found in Peru has not this external prolongation of 
the tibia, " et vient par consequent se ranger exactement a 
cote du type de M. Gray. Nous ne pensons pas que cette 
legere difference soit suffisante pour motiver Tetablissemcnt 
d'un nouveau genre ; nous nous en servirons pour diviser les 
Cnemacanthes en deux sections, ainsi qu'il suit." The au- 
thor then proposes to distinguish those species which have 
the anterior tihiad produced externally, by the name of Cne- 
malohus, retaining Cnemacantlnis for Mr. Gray's species, and 
one other which he names Cnem. parallelus. 

Now to those who are engaged in the study of the geogra- 
phical distribution of species, it is most important to know 
what genera there are, species of which are foimd both in 
Australia and South America ; it is highly desirable therefore 
that the difference in the structure of the anterior tibim of 
Cnemacanthus proper and Odontoscelis should be attended to, 
and that the Cnemacanthus parallelus be submitted to fur- 
ther examination, for Mr. Gray's genus does not differ 07ily 
from Odontoscelis in not having the tihia produced externally 
— there are other very important differences — one of them 
indeed has been considered so important by Dejean,^ that he 
established two great groups which are distinguishable by it, 
and alluded to the tarsi of the intermediate pair of legs being 
dilated in the male sex, as well as the anterior pair ; such is 
the case in Cnemacanthus proper, whereas in Odontoscelis 
only the anterior pair are dilated in the males : again, in 
Cnemacanthus the tooth in the notch of the mentum is short, 
broad, and truncated, whilst in Odontoscelis it is long and 
pointed.

are pitchy black ; a slight blueish tint is observable in cer- 
tain lights on the under parts of the body, and on the under 
side of the prothorax there is a faint green hue : a few long 
hairs spring from the sides of the thorax and ehjtra, and also 
from the fore part of the head and above the eyes. The tho- 
rax is rather narrower than the elytra ; its upper surface is 
convex, the sides are rounded, and so are the posterior an- 
gles, the hinder margin is slightly indented in the middle and 
near the posterior angles : the breadth of the thorax is about 
one third greater than its length ; the dorsal channel is very 
indistinct, and there is a faint, posterior, transverse depres- 
sion ; along the outer margins are seven or eight large pimc- 
tures. The scutellum is large and almost semicircular. The 
elytra are very convex and almost smooth ; their length is 
less than one third greater than their breadth ; on each ely- 
tron is a row of punctures, which commences at the shoulder, 
and ends nearly at the apex of the elytron ; excepting near 
the shoulder (where the punctures are close to the outer mar- 
gin) this row runs parallel with and at a short distance from 
the outer margin of the elytron, and on the margin itself a 
second row of punctures is observable ; these are rather wide- 
ly separated, and each puncture gives root to a long hair ; 
a few punctures, also giving root to long hairs, are also ob- 
servable on the shoulder, and again towards the apex of the 
elytra; these are situated above the first-described row. — 
There are no stri(B on the elytra. On each of the abdominal 
segments is a transverse row of punctures, each having a hair 
like those on the outer margins of the elytra. The legs are 
rather densely clothed with short bristly hairs, especially on 
the tihi(B of the posterior and middle pair ; on the outer mar- 
gin of the anterior tibi(B there are no hairs; these tihicB are 
much dilated at the apex, and the outer portion is produced 
and pointed ; in the male it terminates nearly in a line with 
the apex of the basal joint of the tarsus, whilst in the female, 
where it is larger, it terminates opposite (or nearly so) to the 
base of the fourth joint of the tarsus: a row of punctures is 
observable on the under side of all the femora. Length of 
thorax in the female very nearly 3 lines ; width of ditto 4j 
lines : length of elytra 6j hues ; width of ditto 4| lines in 
the female.

358 NEW SPECIES OF CARABIDEOUS INSECTS. 

This species is about equal in size to the last ; and, like 
that, has a row of widely separated punctures near the lateral 
margins of the thorax ; the punctures on the sides of the ely- 
ira^ segments of the abdomen and femora^ are the same ; it 
differs however in being rather shorter, broader, rather less 
convex, and in having the upper parts of the body black and 
almost destitute of gloss. The thorax is rather convex, much 
broader than long, and equal in width to the elytra^ or very 
nearly so ; the sides and posterior angles are rounded, and 
the dorsal channel very indistinct ; behind is a slight trans- 
verse indentation on either side, and extending nearly to the 
mesial line. Elytra rather convex, about one fourth longer 
than broad; smooth. Legs pitch-coloured ; antennae, palpi, 
and tarsi pitchy red. In one female there is a transverse row 
of punctures on the apical portion of the last segment of the 
abdomen ; in a second about four oblong indentations are 
observable. A very indistinct greenish tint is observable near 
the margins of the thorax and outer margin of the elytra, and 
there is a faint blue tint on the under parts of the insect. — 
Total length, 1 1 lines ; length of thorax 3 lines ; width of 
ditto 4f lines ; length of elytra 6^ lines ; width of ditto 4f 
lines. The specimens described are females.

Sp. 6. Odon. striatus. 

Odon. mediocriter latus, niger, subtus leviter cjEruleo-viricU tiiictus ; ely- 
tris distincte striatis ; striis haud punctatis, interspatiis paululum cou- 
vexis ; elytris ad marginem externum aliquanto violaceis. 

Much less than either of the preceding, but larger than 
Zabrus obesus. General colour black, the under parts of the 
body (especially the thorax) tinted with greenish ; sides of 
elytra and thorax tinted with purple or greenish. Thorax 
convex, about equal in width to the elytra, broader than 
long ; the sides and posterior angles much rounded, the an- 
terior portion emarginated; dorsal channel indistinct; pos- 
terior transverse depression scarcely visible. Elytra convex, 
their breadth about equal to two thirds of their length ; dis- 
tinctly striated, the stricu impunctate, and the interspaces 
convex. On the lateral margins of the thorax are six or se- 
ven large punctures, and close to the outer margin of the elytra 
is a longitudinal series of punctures ; besides these there are

found on and near the mesial line : at the apex of the last 
segment there are from two to four punctures, on either side, 
and placed in a line : numerous hairs, springing from the 
punctures, are observable on the sides of the thorax and ely- 
tra. Length, 8j lines ; width, 3j lines. 

In one of Mr. Darwin's specimens the stridd of the elytra 
are rather less distinct than in two others from which the 
above description is drawn up, and the interstices are flat on 
the fore portion of the elytra ; — it is moreover of a smaller 
size, being only 1\ lines in length. 

Mr. Darwin found this species on a sandy plain at Bahia 
Blanca, N. Patagonia. 

Sp. 7. Odon. suhstriatus. 

Odon. ater, corpore breviusculo, convexo ; elytris substriatis, strlis inclis- 
tinctis, interspatiis leviter convexis. 

Tliorax rather narrower than the elytra^ convex ; the sides 
rounded, posterior angles also rounded, but very slightly 
prominent ; dorsal channel indistinct ; scarcely any trace of 
posterior transverse impression ; elytra convex, their width 
equal to more than two thirds of the length ; faintly striated, 
the interspaces slightly concave. Colour dull black ; under 
parts with a blueish tint. The puncturing on the sides of the 
thorax^ elytra, segments of abdomen, and femora, as usual. 
The hairs on the sides of thorax and elytra numerous. — 
Length from 6f to 7j lines ; width from 2f to 3 lines. 

This species is considerably smaller than either of the pre- 
ceding ; it is proportionately shorter than Odon. Teniyrio'ides, 
there is less space between the thorax and abdomen, and it 
is moreover distinguished by its striated elytra. Odon. Ten- 
tyrioides is smooth, or very nearly so ; Odon. substriatus is 
rather delicately striated, and Odon. striatus is distinctly stri- 
ated. Odon. substriatus is also intermediate in form between 
the other two species mentioned, being shorter and rather 
more convex than the first, and less convex than the last, from 
which it moreover differs in being narrower. 

Genus. — Cardiophthalmvs, Curtis. 

Closely allied, as it appears to me, to Odontoscelis, is the 
genus above named, — a genus (with too long a name) esta- 
blished by Mr. Curtis, upon an insect brought from Port Fa- 
mine by Capt. King. ^ I had long since determined to found

360 NEW SPECIES OF CARABIDEOUS INSECTS. 

a genus upon two species of Carabidce forming part of a col- 
lection placed in my hands for description by Mr. Darwin ; 
but upon Studying Mr. Curtis's paper, I found that they pos- 
sessed all the essential characters of his genus Cardiophthal- 
mus. The chief differences between the insects of this genus 
and those of Odontoscelis, consist in the central tooth of the 
mentum being bifid; the legs and antennce much longer; the 
great length of the spines with which all the tihice are furnished 
at their apex, and the proportionately naiTower thorax^ com- 
bined with the short, ovate and convex form of the body. — 
The anterior tihicB are somewhat suddenly dilated at the apex 
(in the two species before me), and the external portion is 
slightly produced. The anterior femora in the species de- 
scribed by Mr. Curtis, is furnished with three or four small 
angular projections on the under side and near the base. I 
find the same character in one of the specimens before me, 
but in two other specimens (one of which is decidedly the 
same species as the first) there is merely a slight unevenness 
on that part of the femur, — possibly therefore it may be a 
sexual character : in the structure of the anterior tarsi there 
is no difference — they are all slender, and destitute of velvet- 
like pads or membranous appendages beneath.

Thorax considerably narrower than the elytra, convex, the 
sides and posterior angles rounded ; the dorsal channel in- 
distinct; a distinct transverse impression near the hinder 
margin. The thorax is rather attenuated behind, and its 
broadest part is in the middle, or rather anterior to the mid- 
dle. Elytra very convex, ovate, rounded at the apex ; very 
faintly striated, the stricB impunctate. General colour black,

with a very indistinct metallic gloss ; antenn<B pitchy red ; 
palpi pitch-coloured. On the third, lifth, and seventh inter- 
spaces between the strm of the elytra a few widely separated 
punctures are observable, but these are confined to the apical 
portion of the elytra ; moreover, with a tolerably strong lens 
some indistinct punctures may be perceived in the stricB : a 
series of rather widely separated punctures runs along the 
outer margins of the elytra, and on the apical portion are 
many subconfluent punctures. On the under side of each of 
the femora is a row of punctures ; the terminal segment of 
the abdomen is margined with punctures, and there are two 
punctures on each of the abdominal segments, one on either 
side of, and at some little distance from, the mesial line. The 
posterior tarsi are considerably longer than the tihicB ; each 
of the tihi(B is furnished at the apex with two very long spines. 
The antennce are slender, and, if extended backwards, would 
reach beyond the hinder margin of the thorax. 

This species is considerably larger than the Card. Clivin- 
aides ; it is of a broader form, and its legs and antennce are 
longer, as well as the spines with which the former are fur- 
nished.

This species is much smaller than the last, and may more- 
over be distinguished from that and Mr. Curtis's species by 
the very convex, short, and almost rounded form of the body : 
its legs are shorter than in Card, longitarsis, and the poste- 
rior tarsi and tihi(B are equal in length. The thorax is short, 
convex, attenuated behind, and has the sides and posterior 
angles rounded ; the dorsal channel is very indistinct ; and 
there is a transverse depression near the posterior margin : 
the elytra are very convex, ovate, faintly striated, and the 
interstices are slightly convex: the strice are indistinctly 
punctured, excepting on the apical portion of the elytra, 
where the punctures are distinct : some punctures are observ- 
able on the outer margin of each elytron and on the posterior 
margin of the apical segment of the abdomen ; there are also 
two punctures on each of the other segments of the abdomen, 
as in Card, longitarsis. 

Total length, 8 J lines ; length of thorax 2 J lines ; width of 
ditto, 2 J lines ; length of elytra, 5 lines ', width of ditto, Sp-

Art. X. — Descriptions of some new species of Coleopterous In- 
sects. By Edward Newman. 

Natural Order.— CZ£'/2/r£'*S', Newman. 
Genus. — Hydnocera, Newman. 

The genus Hi/dnocera was established in the * Entomologi- 
cal Magazine,' vol. v. page 379. It approaches, in many 
essential characters, the genus Tillus of Fabricius, who pro- 
bably would not have considered it as generically distinct. 
One of the species has been described by Germar in his * In- 
sectorum Species,' under the name of Clerus humeralis ; and 
the same insect has also been labelled as the Tillus humera- 
lis of Say, but I have no reference whatever to any descrip- 
tion by the American entomologist. A second species {Hyd. 
serrata) has been named by myself, and recorded as captured 
by Mr. R. Foster, at Mount Pleasant, in Ohio : and three 
others are now added to the list. All the five inhabit the 
United States of North America. 

The Count Dejean, in his * Catalogue des Coleopteres,' 
has given to the genus the provisional name of Phyllob(C7ius ; 
this I learn from finding one of the species so named by Dr. 
Harris. I observe with regret that the plan of giving trivial 
names, without taking the trouble to secure them by the pub- 
lication of a brief descriptive character, does not meet with 
that neglect and contempt which such a practice deserves ; 
on the contrary, I have not unfrequently seen these spurious 
names attached at random to the genera and species that 
happen to stand unnamed in a cabinet ; and names thus ar- 
bitrarily imposed in the first place, and subsequently applied 
by guess, are becoming rife in the majority of our collections 
of exotic Coleoptera.

Head finely punctured, pale testaceous, with black eyes, 
and, in one specimen only, a black vertical spot : p7'othorax 
considerably longer than broad, its sides nearly parallel, pale 
testaceous, with three longitudinal black lines, one on each 
side, and one dow^n the centre : the elytra are deeply and re- 
gularly punctured, they are very obviously abbreviated, as in 
the genus Necydalis, and the apex of each is incrassated ; they 
are of a uniform pale testaceous colour : the under parts of 
the body are black : the legs testaceous.

The head is small, very much narrower than the protho- 
rax, and produced in an angle anterior to each eye, which is 
completely divided, as in Chiasognathus of Stephens, and 
several cognate genera: the mandibles are porrected, incurved 
at the tip, and nearly approximate at their base ; they are 
twice as long as the head ; each, on the internal side, is fur- 
nished with several teeth of in-egular form, and there is little 
similarity between the two : the right mandible has growing 
fi'om its upper margin, near the extremity, a tooth, which is 
directed forwards, and equals the extreme apex in length, so 
that the apex of this mandible may be termed bifid, while the 
left mandible, being without this tooth, has the apex simple:

the antennae are 10-jointed, the joints irom the 2nd to the 7th 
inclusive, are very short and of nearly equal size, the 8th, 9th 
and 10th are dilated laterally, and form a small but obvious 
mass or club : the prothorax is very convex ; it is wider than 
long ; its greatest diameter is about the middle, and its least 
diameter is anteriorly ; its lateral margins are crenate : the 
elytra are rather narrower than the frothorax : the joints of 
the tarsi are rather elongate, and each is furnished with an 
obvious pilosity. 

Sp. CacQ. squamosus. Fusco-testaceus, splendore metallico modeste de- 
coratus: rugose ac irregulaiiter punctus; squamis argenteis sparsis 
ovalibus omnino tectus. (Corp. long, cum mandibulis *9 uuc. lat. "35

The colour is a testaceous brown, displaying, as the light 
falls on it at various angles, obvious although not brilliant 
metallic hues : every part of the insect is somewhat iiTegu- 
larly punctured, and is covered with small silvery oval scales, 
one of which appears to be attached in each puncture. 

Inhabits ? I received this insect through the hands 

of Mr. Bowerbank, direct from Sydney, and the pin appeared 
similar to those used for other insects in the same collection, 
evidently from that locality, yet I cannot help expressing a 
doubt of its country, which I should have supposed to be 
Assam, or some neighbouring region of continental Asia.

Silphomorpha is a genus separated by Mr. Westwood from 
the Pseudomorpha of Earby, under which name I had unhe- 
sitatingly described the present species. Mr. Westwood has 
remarked of the genera Pseudomorpha, Adelotopiis, Sphallo- 
morplia and Silphomorpha, that '* they possess so many cha- 
racters in common, that they would doubtless be considered 
as belonging to the same genus, were they not carefully ex- 
amined. All of them possess the same formation of legs, 
mandibles, maxillw, minute maxillary palpi, truncate labial 
palpi, &c." — ^ Transactions of the Lin. Soc. Lond.' vol. xviii.

Notice of a remarkahle variety of Vanessa Urticae taken at 
Coventry. — As several instances of remarkable varieties in in- 
sects have been recorded in former volumes of the ' Maga- 
zine of Natural History,' I trust I need make no apology on 
the present occasion, for craving a small space in your pages, 
to notice a very beautiful and extraordinary variety of Va- 
nessa Urticce [Sup, PI. xv.], which was taken during a dry 
season in the month of August, about five or six years ago, 
by Mr. Gee, in his garden at Coventry, and is now in his 
possession. This insect presents an appearance so widely 
different from that of the ordinary specimens of Vanessa 
Urtic(B, that at first sight, it might readily be mistaken for a 
distinct species. Indeed, the gentleman who first drew my 
attention to it, himself an entomologist, observed to me that 
it was unlike anything he had ever seen before, so much so, 
that he knew not what to call it. There is, however, gene- 
rally, about these unusual varieties, a certain indescribable 
something, which enables a practised eye to detect the spe- 
cies to which they belong. The present insect, in spite of 
its dissimilarity, I feel no hesitation in at once refemng to 
Vanessa Urticce. The specimen, I should add, was in the 
freshest and most perfect condition when captured, having 
apparently but just emerged from the chrysalis. The accom- 
panying coloured plate, w^hich is an accurate representation 
of the insect, will give a more correct idea of it, than could 
be conveyed by the most lengthened verbal description. — W,

Art. I. — Additional Notices of Species of the Genus Equus. By 
Edward Blyth, Esq. 

(Vide p. 81 ei seq.) 

It did not occur to me when I wrote the paper above re- 
ferred to, that I had read an elaborate essay by M. Marcel 
des Serres, on the animals represented in the celebrated Pr^e- 
nestine mosaic, wherein it is suggested that a second spe- 
cies of Equus, it would appear, according to the restricted 
application of this term proposed by Mr. J. E. Gray, that 
is, as distinguished from Asinus, Gray (constituted by the 
species with callosities on the fore-liml)s only), is indicated 
upon that antique monument. A translation of this memoir 
is published in the ^ Edinburgh Nevv Philosophical Journal,' 
vols. xvi. pp. 160, 205 -, xvii. 268 ; and xviii. 59. 

" Two species of Solidungula," remarks the author, '^ are 
figured upon the mosaic of Palestrina. The first represents 
the common Horse {Equus cahallus, Linn.) ; whilst the se- 
cond, under which is written the name Avv^, seems to be a 
race which is lost and destroyed [? ] . Prior to the epoch of the 
first ages of the empire, this word would have been written 
Avy^. The animal to which this name is erroneously attached 
appears to be a species of Equus, between the Djigguitai 
and the Quagga. It has nothing in common with the Lynx 
of the ancients, which was the Loup Cervier [Qy. Felis 
pardina, Oken, the beautiful Spanish Lynx now living in 
the Zoological Society's menagerie ?] , as has been well re- 
marked by Perrault [Mem, de V Acad, des So. depuis 1666, 
jusqu'a 1669, torn, i., freya, part., p. 131.) : the slightest ex- 
amination, indeed, suffices to show that the animal named 
Lynx in the mosaic has solid feet, or which terminate in a 
single hoof, together with the body, head, and tail peculiar 
to the Horse. In conformity with these characters, tlien, this

species which is now lost [?] ; supposing that it has really 
existed with the form and proportions which are bestowed 
on it in the antique. On this point/* M. Serres continues, 
*^ we may again remark that this is the more probable, since 
the figures of the mosaic are generally so well delineated, as 
to lead us to conclude that they were copied from nature." 

To judge, however, from the representation of this mosaic 
published in the Appendix to Shaw's ^ Travels in Barbary," 
T should be disposed to place no reliance on the authenticity 
of the figure there indicated by the name mentioned, at least 
as representing a peculiar species ; for I do not perceive in 
what respect it differs from a horse, excepting that no hair 
whatever appears on the tail. Whether Shaw has supplied 
an accurate copy of the original, I have no means of deter- 
mining. M. Serres contends that the Hippotiger of Dion 
refers to the Zebra, and that therefore the ancients were ac- 
quainted with species peculiar to South Africa; this position 
is untenable, since the range of the Zebra extends northward 
to Abyssinia ; and the Karco/SXeylr of ^lian, referred by Cu- 
vier to the White-tailed Gnoo, is equally applicable (as sug- 
gested by Mr. Ogilby) to the Cape Buffcflo, which also extends 
northward to Abyssinia; or supposing the Catohlepas Brook- 
sii of Col. Han)iiton Smith to be a true species, it may allude 
to this, the locality of which is unknown^ By the term Djig- 
guitai {E, he^nioniis), M. Serres probably alludes to the Khur ; 
and he observes that the animal in question was domesticated 
by the Greeks in many provinces of Asia. I have somewhere 
read that three different Hebrew appellations are rendered 
by the term ^ss in the various translations of the Old Tes- 
tament, and that the Asses of Saul were of the wild kind, 
denominated in their native region Khur, which sufficiently 
accounts for their alleged value. 

^^ Wild Asses" of some sort, it would appear, are ^^ common 
in the districts of theThebaid" (vide Wilkinson's ^ Domestic 
Manners of the Ancient Egyptians/ iii. 21.), and a *' wild 
Ass" is mentioned in the narrative of Lander's expedition 
(p. 571.). Are these of the striped kind noticed by Bruce ? 
Or are they of the species termed ^' Isabelline Zebra" by 
Levaillant ? Or may they not be Khurs, and at the same 
time identical with Levaillant's animal ? In the island of So- 
cotra, Lieut. Wellsted mentions that '^ Amidst the hills over 
Tamarida, and on the plain contiguous to it, there are a great 
number of Asses, which were described to me as different

from the domestic Ass ; but after repeated opportunities of 
observing them, I could find no reason for such a distinction. 
The introduction of Camels/' he remarks, " having super- 
seded the necessity of employing them as beasts of burden, 
they are permitted to stray where they please, and now wan- 
der about in troops of ten or twelve, evincing little fear unless 
approached very near, when they dart away with much ra- 
pidity." (Journ. Geog. Soc. 1835, p. 202.) Azara notices, 
of those which have gone wild in South America, and espe- 
cially about Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz, where he states that 
the increasing population was fast destroying them, that those 
which he saw appeared to be somewhat larger than the do- 
mestic ones of Paraguay, but smaller than the common asses 
of Spain ; nor does that large race, which is there used for 
the breeding of mules, exist in these parts. They also ap- 
pear to have larger and stiifer ears than in my native country." 
Russell, in his ' Natural History of Aleppo,' p. 58, remarks, 
that the Levantine nations have two principal breeds of 
Asses ; ^' one very large, with remarkably long ears ; the 
other small, and much like ours in England." 

Those of Upper Egypt, according to Sonnini, are par- 
ticularly handsome, but they degenerate towards the Delta. 
Eraser states, that " the Asses of Omaun are celebrated as 
the best in Arabia, and individuals of the best breeds sell for 
very extravagant prices." (Journey to Khorassan, p. 18.) 
Not, however, that the Asses of warm countries are inva- 
riably superior to those of the north ; for the domestic breed 
of India is remarkably small, and Col. Sykes states that in 
the Deccan they are scarcely bigger than a Newfoundland 
Dog. In Egypt it appears that the fine breed of that country 
has existed from very remote antiquity, to judge from the 
ancient paintings, where the cross- line of the shoulders is 
represented in every instance that I have seen. 

There is reason, I suspect, to infer that the Persians distin- 
guish the Khur from the Goor-Khur, Ghore-Khur, Gur- 
Khor, Gour-Khor, or sometimes simpl)^ Gour (which is not 
to be confounded with the Gaour, Bos gaurus, of India) ; 
one of these animals inhabiting chiefly the west, and the other 
the eastern portion of that country : the true Djigguitai is, 
however, clearly indicated in Morier's second ' Journey 
through Persia' (p. 200), as the "wild Ass" of Casvin, not 
far from Tabriz, '* of a light mouse colour, with a dark streak 
over the shoulders and down the back;" and it is probably 
that mentioned in ^Johnson's Journey' (p. 149.), as "found 
in the salt plains near Tehraun, and in greater numbers to- 
wards Mansila." The Hon. Mountstewart Elphinstone, in 
his ^ Account of the Kingdom of Caboul,' notices it, by the

appellation Goo7'-khur, as an inhabitant of the daherts between 
India and Affghanistan. " It is called/' he sayt;, *' Gour by 
the Persians, and is usually seen in herds, though often singly, 
straying away in the wantonness of liberty/' Tliose exhi- 
bited in European menageries have been mostly, if not ex- 
clusively, captured in the Thurr, or great sandy desert north 
of Cutch. The " wild Asses'' of Mesopotamia, on the other 
hand, and at the foot of Taurus, as mentioned by Mr. Ains- 
worth, those of Arabia, and perhaps of the Thebaid and else- 
where on the African continent, are probably all of the kind 
that has no mesial stripe down the back, as noticed in two in- 
dividuals by Sir R. K. Porter. If it should turn out that the Khur 
and Ghoor-khur are really distinct, as also the Kiang^ of Thi- 
bet, the near approximation of so many species (to which may 
be added the common Ass) will render it desirable that the 
ILquus hemionus of Pallas should be compared with the '' wild 
Ass" of Cutch, which latter, I believe, has never any trace of 
colouring upon the limbs^ except a very faint tinge at their com- 
mencement, whereas the other appears to have the exterior sur- 
face of its limbs not much paler than the parts above. The "wild 
Ass " of M. Gmelin, also, figured with a cross upon its back in 
the continuation of M. Schreber's work by M. Wagner, and 
remarkable for the silvery white of its under parts ascending 
from the flanks in front of each haunch to join that on 
either side of the dorsal line, a particular carefully described 
as well as figured, might advantageously be compared with 
the domestic JB. asinus. The female observed by M. Gmelin 
had no cross stripe over its shoulder, such as was found in 
the male, and is, I believe, invariably constant in the com- 
mon animal ; whilst in the Mongolian wild Ass, M. Gmelin 
was informed that the mark referred to is by no means 
constant (as his two specimens testified), and that some- 
times there is even a double cross-band over the shoulders. 
Prof. Gmelin succeeded in bringing his female wild ass, 
together with a colt, to St. Petersburgh ; and he remarks 
that she sometimes passed two days without drinking, and 
preferred brackish water to fresh : she carried her head 
higher than the common tame Ass, her ears well elevated, 
and evinced much spirit and vivacity in all her movements, 
such as we are accustomed to observe of the Djigguitai. 

Mr. Moorcroft, the same writer from whose * Travels ' I 
quoted the previous notices of the Kiang, remarks, in the ac- 
count of his ' Journey to Lake Manasurovara' (' As. Res.^ vol. 
xii.), that "the wild Horse [E.quagga), the wild Ass [Ghoor-

khur^ Onagra)^ and I believe the mule, the offspring of these 
animals, are found in abundance on the mountains of Tartary" ; 
and again, — " This day we saw more wild Horses than on any 
former one, also several wild Asses of the kind called Gurkhoi-, 
and I believe the mules. The Asses are a little less than the 
Horses" (p. 462.). And in another place (p. 512.), he de- 
scribes meeting with " many wild Asses, and some animals 
which are thought more like Mules than either Horses or 
Asses." Here there can be little doubt three distinct species 
are noticed, viz. the true wild Horse, either the wild Ass or 
the Djigguitai, and probably the Kiang. The latter is noticed 
by the same author in the ' Transactions of the Royal Asiatic 
Society,' vol. i. p. 55, as *^ a nondescript wild variety [species] 
of Horse, which appeared to be about fourteen hands high, of a 
round muscular form, with remarkably clean limbs. Not more 
than a dozen came within view, and they were all out of 
shot. A native of the district was directed to lie in wait, and 
a suitable remuneration was offered for the skin, head, and 
organs of voice for dissection. The man," continues the au- 
thor, " has completed his task, and I shall have these mat- 
ters as soon as the Pass of Changlung will admit of being 
traversed." Should the executors of the late Mr. Moorcroft 
possess any notes by him of such examination, the publica- 
tion of them would be acceptable to zoologists. In the * Asi- 
atic Researches," vol. xviii. pt. II. p. 247, Mr. Gerard seems 
to allude to this animal, as resisting every attempt to tame 
it when caught, so that it has never been domesticated : and 
Dr. Gerard met with "great herds of Kiangs" at an altitude 
of I7j700 feet. Mr. Moorcroft likewise notices, in his ^Tra- 
vels,' (1. 370, after at p. 311, indicating the Kiang as distinct), 
that '^ the Ghor-khur or wild Ass," whichever species is 
meant it is useless to attempt to determine, '^ is common in 
Chan- than." Finally, it may be mentioned that the word 
''Asses" occurs in the interesting list of wild animals inha- 
biting the Malay peninsula, published in the 1 8th volume of 
the ' Asiatic Researches,' p. 159 ; but from the context I 
cannot doubt that it is a misprint for Apes,

After this brief description of the extinct fauna of the 
genera and species once living here, which I have accom-

panied, at the end of each family, with the observations 
they more immediately called forth, I presume to direct the 
Society's attention to the general considerations that natu- 
rally arise respecting the peculiarities of that ancient fauna, 
and its relation to the present. Of the four orders into 
which mammals are divided, we find on this continent repre- 
sentatives both in the former and modern period. The most 
numerous of these orders, as well for genera as species, is 
now that of Myoidea ; next to which follows that of Aclei- 
dota, then Bruta, and last of all Quadrumana. This rela- 
tive proportion in the orders, with regard to their contents 
of genera and species, was not the same formerly as it is 
now. The order Acleidota was the most numerous; next 
followed Myoidea, then Bruta, then Quadrumanay as the 
following table will more clearly show : —

This change in the relative richness of the orders is occa- 
sioned principally by the appearance in the latter period of 
the numerous family of Bats; which, as far as our re- 
searches have gone, appear not to have existed in the fossil 
period. 

Of the sixteen families into which the four orders of 
mammals are subdivided, nine are now found in this di- 
strict, namely, the Myrmecophaga, Armadillo, Rumiriants, 
Pachydermata, FercB (predatory beasts). Marsupials, Ro- 
dents, Bats, and Apes, Of these nine, one is hitherto want- 
ing to the list of the families belonging to the extinct 
Fauna, in like manner as one that played a conspicuous 
part formerly, the Sloth, is no longer found in these parts. 
Again, with regard to the comparative richness of the other 
families, the two periods do not entirely agree 5 as far, at 
least, as we can conclude from the confessedly imperfect list 
we as yet pjossess of the fossil species. In both periods the 
family of Rodents is the most abundant, both in genera and 
species ; next to which follow Feres ; but this latter is 
proved to have been richer in genera, and probably also in 
species, then than now. The most marked difference, how- 
ever, is in the family of Ruminants, which in the former 
period contained a much larger quotient, both of genera and 
species, than in the modern. The same is also the case, 
though not in so high a degree, with the Armadillos and

If now we turn to a general consideration of the genera 
of the extinct fauna with reference to their agreement with 
the present, we find that out of the thirty-two genera (lea- 
ving out the fossil Rodent above-mentioned, wliich I have not 
yet been able to identify) which the extinct class of mam- 
mals has hitherto afforded us, eighteen still inhabit this di- 
strict, while fourteen are no longer found here. We thus see 
that the deeper we examine the subordinate divisions of the 
system, the greater is the agreement between the ancient 
and the recent faunas ; so much so, that more than half the 
genera are identical for the two periods. The genera com- 
mon to both may be conveniently divided into two groups, 
which are of very unequal importance in developing the 
history of our globe. Under the first group I class those 
genera that are common to both the Old and New World, 
and which are therefore not adapted to throw any light on 
the peculiar types of animal life belonging to this continent 
in former periods. These genera are only six ; namely, 
Cervus, Tapirus, Felis, Canis, Lepus, and Mus. The 
second group consists of the genera which are at present 
confined to this quarter of the globe. It is more numerous 
than the first, and contains the following twelve genera : — 
Myrmecophaga, Dasypus, Dicotyles, JSyrara, Nasua, Di- 
delp/iis, Echhnys, Synoetheres, Anoema, Dasyprocta, Ccelo- 
genys, and Hydrochcerus. The first glance at this group is 
sufficient to show that " the fauna which inhabited the 
tropical highlands of Brazil previous to the last re-construc- 
tion of our earth, was in its fundamental types the same as 
is now found there." This result is of vast importance with 
reference to the theory of the relations of development in 
the organic productions of our planet ; and I reserve for a 



876 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

future opportunity the consideration of some of the weight- 
iest consequences that result from this fact. 

Turning next to the genera belonging to the extinct 
fauna which are no longer found in this district, we are 
able to separate them also tolerably well into two divisions ; 
of which the first will contain those that have entirely dis- 
appeared from the earth's surface, and the other those which 
still exist, but at a greater or lesser distance from the spot 
where their remains are now discovered. The former of 
these divisions includes ten genera — Euryodon, Heterodon, 
Chlamydotherium, Hoplophorus, P achy t her ium, Ccelodoti, 
Megalonyx, Leptotherium, Mastodon, and Protopithecus, 
If now we consider more closely the genera comprised in 
this division, we find that far the greatest proportion of them 
belong to the order of sloths (Bruta), and that they are 
composed of large clumsy animals, whose extraordinary in- 
harmonious organization seems to have contained the seed 
of its destruction. The second of these divisions is com- 
posed of only four genera — Antelope, Camel, Bear, and 
Hycena; but the existence of these animals in the Brazilian 
highlands in the former period is a phaenomenon of the 
highest interest, and calculated to awaken the most import- 
ant considerations. I have shown that the fossil species of 
Camel belonged unquestionably to the under-group of Auche- 
nias, and that we therefore have to seek the modern habitat 
of this form in the chain of the Andes ; also that the fossil 
species of Bear seems in like manner most to resemble 
those which in our time inhabit the same mountain range. 
"With regard to the third genus, Antelope, we must certainly, 
in the present state of our knowledge, consider it a form 
peculiar to the Old World. I have, however, already alluded 
to the possibility of a representative of this genus being 
eventually found also in the Andes. On the other hand, the 
last of these four genera, Hycena, leaves us no other re- 
source than the striking conclusion, that the plains of South 
America formerly sustained genera of mammals which, at 
the present time, are confined to the hot zone of the Old 
World ; and we have seen that this conclusion is still fur- 
ther corroborated by the two subgenera of Cynailurtis and 
Speothos', forms that, in the existent creation, are only 
found in the warm districts of the Old World, but which 
have left indubitable traces of their presence in the extinct 
fauna of this continent. 

If we next descend to the lowest step in the subdivisions 
of the system, that is to species, and compare the extinct 
with the existing, we are again led to separate them into two 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 377 

divisions, of which the first contains those animals that con- 
siderably differ from all now living, while the second includes 
such as resemble the present order of creation. Before, 
however, I proceed to distinguish these fossil species, I must 
first put aside those of which I either possess too imperfect 
specimens to allow me to institute any satisfactory compari- 
son, or else the osteology of the correspondent recent species 
is not sufficiently known to me. To this class belong seven 
species, namely. Tapir, Cerviis, the small species of Tiger, 
Fox, Coata-mundi, and the lesser kind of Capivar. I do 
not add to this list either the species of Miis or Didel- 
phis. Not becavise 1 want the necessary materials for 
comparison, but because a complete comparison of these 
species requires lengthened and accurate previous exami- 
nation of the osteology of the recent kinds, a labour to 
which I have not as yet had the opportunity of devoting 
myself. Taking away these eleven species, there remain forty- 
three, which will serve for the foundation of our comparison. 
I begin with the species of the four genera, Camel, Anteloiye, 
Bear, 2i\\^Hy6ena\ which, as we have seen, are indeed not now 
found in the Highlands of Brazil, but have not ceased to con- 
tinue their existence in other parts of our earth. We have 
before observed that the two species of the genus Camel ex- 
cluded, by their very size, any suspicion of their conformity 
with the existing species of this genus. With regard to the 
three other genera, Bear, Antelope, and Hycena, nothing but 
direct comparison can positively decide the question as to 
their identity with the respective species inhabiting the chain 
of the Andes, and the Old World ; at the same time I cannot 
but think that the result of the investigations I am about to 
detail will leave little room for doubt on this subject. In 
order, however, to remove all uncertainty from the compari- 
son I am instituting, I will cast out these three also, so that 
only forty species remain to be considered. In the first di- 
vision, which comprises all those species which differ con- 
siderably from those now living here, we may first of all class 
all those that belong to genera that have entirely disappeared 
from the earth's surface. These, as we have seen, are the 
following ten : Euryodon, Heterodon, Chlamydotherium, 
Hoplophorus, Pachytherium, Coelodon, Megalonyx, Lep- 
totherium, Mastodon, and Protojnthecus : these genera com- 
prise fourteen. species ; to which we may add the undeter- 
mined genus of Rodent, with a single species,and the lately 
mentioned species of Camel; in all seventeen species. 

I now come to the genera that are now, as formerly, found 
in this district, excluding those species which either the first 

Vol. IV.— No. 44. n. s. 3 a 



378 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

glance or longer examination have satisfied me to be different 
from the recent. These species are seventeen, viz. the 
gigantic Ant-bear^ the four species of Peccari, the large 
Tiger^ Cynailurus, the Cave-wolf, the Cave-jackall, the 
Honey -glutton {Eyrara), the largest species of Spiny -rat, 
the large Cuandu [Hystrix prehensilis), the gigantic Cutia, 
the three species of Paca, and lastly, the gigantic Capivar. 
Adding now these seventeen species to the seventeen before 
described, we have thirty-four out of forty that are decidedly 
different from existing species. The second division of the 
fossil species is composed of those which, from the more or 
less considerable portions that I possess of their skeletons, 
show so great a conformity to the living species, that I have 
not been able to discover any specific difference. These are 
the following six : one species of genus Dasypus, two spe- 
cies of Echimys, the fossil Rabbit, the Perea, and a fossil 
species of Cutia. Thus the proportion of the conformable 
to the unconformable species is as 6 to 34. 

In this manner we have seen, as we gradually descend in 
our comparison of orders, families, genera, and down to spe- 
cies, that at each step the unconformity between the ancient 
and present fauna increases. This difference, indeed, is so 
great in the last step of all, that one may well be tempted to 
propose the question, whether this slight bond of connexion 
wherewith we see them linked together, is really fashioned 
by nature herself, or is only attributable to our imperfect 
methods and means of comparison. The decision of this 
question being of the highest importance to science, the 
Society will allow me to dwell a little longer on the subject. 
I would wish first to remark, that the conclusion on which 
the identity of the six species with the existing fauna is 
founded, is far from possessing the certainty of that which 
determines the unconformity of the other thirty-four. I do 
not possess a perfect skeleton of any one of these six species ; 
and it is very possible that these fossil species, though agree- 
ing with the recent in those portions that I possess, might 
differ from them in others, with which I am not acquainted. 
This possibility has, in fact, been proved in the case of one of 
the extinct genera, the Paca. I had in my possession a vast 
quantity of the remains of this genus, which showed so 
striking a resemblance to the living species, that I at first 
referred the fossil animal to it, until the examination of the 
respective skulls, as I have before observed, convinced me 
not only of their specific difference, but also proved to me 
the existence of two distinct species among the fossils of this 
genus. If, therefore, we were to allow analogy to be our 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 379 

guide, we ought to suppose for the other few species that are 
in the same circumstances as were the fossil species of Paca, 
until complete comparisons enable us to settle the question, 
a similar condition, that is a specific difference from the 
living species, to which they show a greater or less con- 
formity. 

I think, therefore, that I am supported by the highest de- 
gree of probability, approaching in most points to certainty, 
in confidently laying down this result, that the pre-existing 
race of mammals in South America, as far as regards spe- 
cies, was entirely different from that which now inhabits 
this same continent. Cuvier was led to the same result by 
his examination of the extinct fauna of the Old World ; and 
the more this important conclusion has been doubted and 
combated by later naturalists, the more am I gratified in 
being enabled, by my researches in this quarter of the globe, 
to corroborate it. 

Having thus cast a cursory glance at the extinct mammals 
which last existed in this district, and having next considered 
more closely their relation to the modern fauna that has suc- 
ceeded them on the same spot, we will now advance from 
this foundation, and by the help of these new facts, where- 
with science has been enlarged, endeavour to elucidate seve- 
ral important points in the history of our globe. It had 
been a firmly received maxim in science, that the tropical 
zone, at least in its lower portions, was either entirely unin- 
habited in the period that immediately preceded the present 
state of things, or at any rate was very thinly inhabited. 
The present inquiry has, on the contrary, proved that this 
zone, far from having been uninhabited at that time, dis- 
played a richness and variety in its animal kingdom, which 
seem far to surpass what nature is able to maintain there in 
our days. We have seen that this position is certain for the 
greater portion of the families composing the class of mam- 
mals, and that it is true for the whole of them, as far as 
genera are concerned ; but that it may be equally so for 
them, with reference also to species, no one surely will doubt 
when he thinks of the great number of species that have at 
once been discovered, upon the very first glance we have 
cast behind the curtain of that extinct fauna, a number so very 
little inferior to that of the living races. This probability must 
undoubtedly appear to every one so strong by itself, that I 
cannot but consider it almost superfluous to corroborate it 
by the following considerations. The extinct fauna is in the 
natural course of things withdrawn from our observation : 
only favourable circumstances, and luckily conducted explora-

tions, have brought to light some isolated specimens of its 
scattered remains ; while, on thecontrary, the existent crea- 
tion presents itself of its own accord to our eye, so that sooner 
or later it must be the entire property of science. We may, 
therefore, consider the list of existing species in that class of 
animals of which we are now speaking, as almost complete ; 
whereas we may expect with every day an increase to the 
catalogue of extinct species. 

This poverty of animal forms, that had hitherto been ima- 
gined to mark the tropical zone, was endeavoured to be ex- 
plained by the supposition of an extraordinarily high temper- 
ature, that prevented the development of animal life. We 
now know" that this supposition, and the facts on which it was 
grounded, are equally without foundation. The tropical zone 
enjoyed at that period a temperature which not only did not 
prevent the development of animal life, but was even far 
more favourable to it than that which it at present possesses. 
If we have a right to suppose that the richness and variety 
of organic productions, and their development with regard 
to size, are in proportion to temperature, — a proposition 
which is generally received, and when viewed on a large scale 
is confirmed by experience, — then undoubtedly we cannot 
but ascribe a higher temperature to that zone in ancient 
times than it now enjoys ; but this excess of heat is yet 
much less than what naturalists were hitherto disposed to 
claim for it on the foundation of an incorrect fact. 

It w^ould be an important task to compare the extinct 
mammals of tropical America with the correspondent fauna 
of the temperate and frigid zones of the same continent. But 
unfortunately the insufficiency of our materials prevents us 
from instituting any such comparison. Our knowledge of 
the fauna inhabiting the corresponding zones in the Old 
World is much more complete ; but even there several cir- 
cumstances forbid a direct comparison. In the first place, 
the tropical zone in the Old World, at the present time, is 
richer in species of mammals than the same region in the 
New World. In the second place, the extent of country 
through which the fossils belonging to the former age of the 
earth have been sought for on the old continent, is infinitely 
greater than the district in which I have had the opportunity 
of pursuing my investigations. In the third place, the length 
of time during which the fossils have been collected in the 
Old World, and the number of scientific collectors interested 
therein, are both very considerable ; whereas the description 
here attempted of the extinct fauna of S. America is the 
fruit of two years' labour of a solitary individual. Taking 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL IlEVOLUTION. 381 

these modifying circumstances into consideration, I think 
that a comparison between the extinct fauna of tropical 
America, and of extra-tropical Europe will not be without 
use, 

[Dr. Lund here refers to a Table, marked 4, which, as he 
says in a note, '* represents the state of our knowledge on 
this point of fossil zoology at the time when Cuvier con- 
cluded his inquiries respecting it ; and I am not aware that 
there have been any subsequent additions, of essential im- 
portance, with regard to number of species/*] 

If we now compare this description with the list of South 
America's extinct mammals, we see that the latter exceeds 
the other in number, both of species and genera ; and if we 
further lay in the scale all the circumstances to which I have 
just drawn attention, it is very clear that we must allow to 
the tropical region of America a far richer fauna in the an- 
cient period, than to the extra-tropical portion of the Old 
World. Such a disproportion between these two zones, with 
reference to their animal productions, can only be explained 
by the supposition of a corresponding difference in temper- 
ature ; so that we see it results from these considerations as 
a very probable consequence, that at that epoch also, as now, 
the surface of our planet presented a difference of tempera- 
ture, according to geographical latitude, in other words, cli- 
matic distinctions had already begun to act. 

But as surely as the extra-tropical portions of our globe 
were already at that period inferior in temperature to the 
tropical, equally certain is it that they then enjoyed a higher 
temperature than is now allotted to them. When we see 
that the class of extinct mammals, found in the extra-tro- 
pical zone of the Old World, surpasses that now living there 
in variety and abundance of forms, as well as for the most 
part in number of species ; when we also see that the prin- 
cipal of these forms are such as in the present creation are 
peculiar to the tropics ; surely the most prejudiced person 
must be led to conclude that the temperature of those which 
are now the temperate and frigid zones, must have formerly 
more or less corresponded to the actual heat of the tropical 
zone.^ 

' It is not my intention here to revive the much- canvassed subject of the 
hairy Elephants and Rhinoceros of Siberia ; but I cannot forbear remark- 
ing, how very hasty they were who endeavoured at once to draw from this 
phsenomenon the conclusion that the climate of Siberia cannot have changed. 
In the first place, this hairy covering is found on a very great number of 
tropical animals ; secondly, it has in this instance struck us so much, be- 
cause it occurred in an animal that we are accustomed to see without any 



382 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

A glance at our list of the extinct mammalian fauna of 
Brazil, will be sufficient to show that in its main features it 
bore the same stamp as the system that has succeeded it in 
the same region. This peculiarity in South America's ex- 
isting fauna is in harmony with the isolated position and the 
form of this continent. When, therefore, we find this same 
peculiarity in its animal productions in that former period, 
we are emboldened to conclude that its general form and 
boundaries were the same then as now. The existence at 
that time of generic forms in South America, which at pre- 
sent are peculiar to the Old World, such as the Hyaena and 
Antelope, can no more weaken the force of this conclusion, 
than the present existence of a genus in South America, be- 
longing to the New Holland family of Marsupials, is sufficient 
to prove that the two continents are now united together. 
On the other side, the proof of the existence of one and the 
same species of mammal, in the warmer regions of Europe 
and in South America, would be a phaenomenon calculated to 
strengthen the uniform result to which all our examinations 
have hitherto led us. And exactly such a specific identity 
between inhabitants of the old and new continents is known 
to have occurred in those times : the authority for this is 
Cuvier. As accident would have it, the very first specimen 

such protection. It is, however, certain that the Indian Elephant's want 
of hair arises from slavery and confinement ; and that in its wild state it is 
provided with a hairy coat, which is most abundant on the younger ani- 
mals, and which increases so much in the colder mountain chains, that it 
is said they are sometimes met with " as hairy as Poodles," according to 
the expression used by Bishop Heber. This may appear somewhat over- 
stretched, but Mr. G. Fairholm has instituted the most rigorous inves- 
tigation on this subject, and has satisfied himself of the fact. Again, if we 
conclude that this hairiness of the fossil Elephant afford proof of a polar 
climate in those regions where it dwelt, we must extend this climate over 
the whole of Southern Europe, throughout which, and particularly in Sicily 
near Palermo, have I found the bones of the fossil Elephant, with those 
of the Hippopotamus. And lastly, we must not forget, that even if these 
animals, thus provided with a thick coat of hair, could withstand the cli- 
mate of Northern Siberia, such as it is in our time, still the scanty vege- 
tation of that region could not possibly have afforded adequate nourish- 
ment to these colossal creatures, that appear to have lived there in consi- 
derable numbers ; the more so, inasmuch as the Elephant, by reason of its 
dental provisions, is principally confined to feeding on leaves of trees ; 
whereas not only all arboreal vegetation is absent throughout a great ex- 
tent of the polar zone, where these bones are found in vast quantities, but 
also all vegetation whatever is suspended during a great part of the year. 
This last objection has been endeavoured to be removed by the supposi- 
tion that they were migratory animals, which migrated southwards at the 
approach of winter ; but it seems to be forgotten that it is precisely on the 
islands of the Frozen Ocean that these bones are found the most abundantly.

of South America's antediluvian fauna that was submitted to 
that great zoologist's notice {Mastodon angustidens) came 
under this category. It is easy to conceive that such a cir- 
cumstance should excite in that deep philosopher especial 
attention to this continent and its ancient inhabitants ; and 
in fact it did raise doubts in his mind of the existence at that 
period of the Atlantic Ocean, in its present boundary and posi- 
tion, at least. Meanwhile I must remark, that the supposition 
of this specific correspondence is founded on so few means of 
comparison, that we are bound, by the importance of the con- 
clusion, to suspend our decision until further inquiries shall 
enable us to come to it with greater certainty : but in what- 
ever way this question may eventually be decided, I do not 
conceive that this isolated, though confessedly important 
phaenomenon can with any justice throw doubt on the cor- 
rectness of the above-given result, to which all our other 
knowledge of the extinct fauna of this continent has con- 
ducted us. 

After this glance at the ancient temperature of our globe, 
and the form of its continents, I proceed to consider the re- 
sults, to which the facts brought forward in this paper may 
lead us, with reference to the nature of the great catastrophe 
which overwhelmed the animal race, whose remains we have 
been considering. I have shown in my previous communi- 
cation that the surface of this district, throughout that part 
which I have visited, consists of loose soil of different quali- 
ties, among which a red clay is most conspicuous, that often 
contains beds of rolled or angular fragments of quartz ; 
again, that this same soil fills up all the clefts and cavities 
in the rocks ; and that it is in this deposit of soil within the 
caves that the bones of the extinct animals are found ; that 
the bones lie scattered without order in the soil, often in 
astonishing quantities, and that for the most part they are 
broken or injured in various ways. Now if we collect under 
one point of view all these several circumstances (for the de- 
tailed consideration of which I refer to my former paper), it 
is evident that there is but one natural solution of them. The 
caverns, wherein we find these heaps of bones, served for 
dens to predatory animals in the ancient time ; and the 
bones that occur there, are the remains of animals that formed 
their prey. The injuries to which the bones have been ex- 
posed, leave no room for doubt upon the subject. These 
bones then, and fragments of bones, lay heaped up on the 
floor of the caves, when a vast deluge which covered the whole 
land with the deep stratum of loose soil that we now see to 
overspread its entire surface, violently burst into the caverns. 



384 VIKW OP THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

scattered about the heaps of bones, and enveloped them in 
the same sedimentary deposit with which it covered the sur- 
face outside the caves. I have traversed this district over 
an extent of more than 8000 square miles, and have every- 
where discovered the indubitable traces of such a deluge. I 
have shown that ^' Canga,'^ which exceeds the highest moun- 
tain summits in Brazil (6000 ft.), is a contemporaneous for- 
mation of the same diluvian deposit ; and I therefore think 
I am entitled to consider it as definitively settled . that this 
portentous catastrophe extended over the whole of this con- 
tinent, with the possible exception of the very loftiest moun- 
tain tops. In the preceding communication I have shown 
that the red clay soil, which is the most general sedimentary 
soil of this district, is also that which most abundantly fills 
up the caverns. I have there pointed out, that in consequence 
of this particular position, the soil has received many extra- 
neous additions, of which the most important are, the inter- 
mixture of angular or rolled fragments of the limestone in 
which the caves occur ; next, the percolation of calcareous 
particles, which have formed crystals in its cavities, and 
changed it to a mass hard as stone ; and lastly, the intro- 
duction of a more or less considerable quantity of bones, for 
the most part in fragments, and particularly white in the 
fracture. 

No naturalist can have read the description of these phae- 
nomena without thinking of the osseous breccia on the coasts 
of the Mediterranean. I have seen many specimens of this 
breccia in the museums of Europe ; and I can assert that so 
perfect is the external resemblance, that without the labels it 
would be scarcely possible to distinguish the osseous con- 
glomerate of Brazil from its well-known contemporary of 
the Old World. The identity of the two formations, there- 
fore, in my mind, cannot be disputed. 

It will appear evident from the description I have given in 
the preceding conmiunication of the loose soil that consti- 
tutes the last member in the geognostical formations of this 
land, that this bed is identical with those which also in Eu- 
rope form the most usual covering to the surface, and which 
are distinguished by their greater or lesser abundance of 
rolled stones. I have already remarked more than once, that 
these beds of soil, with all their characteristic properties, 
are found filling up the cavities and chasms in the rocks, and 
that they have there undergone some alterations which, how- 
ever, leave no room for doubt as to their origin. This iden- 
tity between the osseous conglomerate of this country, and 
the loose soil of the surface, is easily recognised, and serves 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 385 

to throw light on a geological phaenomenon in the Old World, 
that has hitherto been veiled in some obscurity : and I trust 
that the contemporaneousness of the boulder formation of 
Europe, and of the osseous breccia of the northern coast of 
the Mediterranean, may from this time be considered an in- 
contestable fact in science. This correspondence in respect 
to the youngest geological formations at two points of our 
planet so far removed from each other, leaves scarcely any 
doubt as to the very general operation of the mighty cata- 
strophe that effected these formations. If any one wish for 
yet another link to this chain of geological coincidences, I 
would refer him to the latest researches in New Holland. 
I have carefully compared Mr. Henderson's description of 
the soil that fills the caves in Wellington Valley, as also 
of the conditions under which the bones are there found, and 
I recognize the most striking conformity to the circumstances 
I have observed in this country. I here close this trea- 
tise, which was only intended to give a short view of the ex- 
tinct fauna of this district. I have commenced with the 
class of mammals, as being the most perfect to be met with 
on the theatre of that creation, inasmuch as Man, that 
creation's lord, had not yet entered on the scene. I am 
well aware how careful we should be in founding a con- 
clusion on a negative fact; but when this negative fact holds 
good so constantly as is here the case, in the midst of so 
many positive facts that rise around it, and serve each to 
confirm it, I think we cannot refuse to it an equal weight 
with any of them. And how, I may ask, was it possible 
for man to exist' in a country so full of fearful beasts of 
prey, as was Brazil in those ages ? How especially was it 
possible, that amid the vast mass of victims, which the 
first glance behind the scenes of that ancient world has shown 
us, so weak a creature as man should alone have escaped the 
necessity of yielding to physical superiority the sacrifice 
that so many more powerful animals were compelled to 
offer ? I think we may conclude with certainty, that vvhere 
the haunts of the Tiger and Hysena betray no trace of human 
bones, our race had not appeared as an element in the com- 
position of the organic world. 

This paper having swelled to a much greater compass than 
I originally contemplated, I think it will be convenient if I 
subjoin a brief survey of the main results of my labours, so 
far as they are new to science. 

In the period that immediately preceded the last geolo- 
gical revolution on the surface of this earth, the tropical 
zone was by no means uninhabited, or even scantily provided

386 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF BRAZIL 

with animal life, as has hitherto been generally supposed, 
but, on the contrary, presents an abundance and variety in its 
fauna, which appears to have far surpassed what is now ob- 
served there. With respect to the class of mammals, the 
superiority of the ancient order of creation is proved in the 
case of genera, and it is highly probable that the total 
amount of species was also greater. The families of Arma- 
dilloes and Sloths, together with those of Rumiiiants and 
Pachyderrnata, being more numerous formerly than at pre- 
sent both in genera and species ; there is the greatest degree 
of probability that this was also the case in the families of 
Ferce and Rodents. The family of Simian existed at that 
period, whereas it seems that J3ats were wanting. The 
mammalian class of this continent exhibited the same pecu- 
liar stamp that now distinguishes it. At the same time, in 
the very midst of these peculiar South American forms, ap- 
peared some that in our day are confined to the warmer 
regions of the Old World. The greater portion of the 
genera, of which this country's mammalian fauna formerly 
consisted, exist there now : of those which are wanting, 
most are entirely extinct, others have disappeared from the 
whole of this continent, while a few are confined to the lofty 
mountain chains of the western coast. 

The existing species are all distinct from the fossil : man 
did not exist at that period. From these results, which are 
nothing more than a comprehensive expression of facts, I 
collect the following more general consequences, which cer- 
tainly seem to me to follow necessarily from the above ; but 
which, as they rest upon conclusions that may not have equal 
force in the eyes of all, should be separated from the former. 
The form of the continents was the same in the ancient 
period as in the present. The temperature on the entire sur- 
face of the earth was higher than now : but at the same time 
it diminished from the equator towards the poles. The na- 
tural catastrophe that annihilated the nimierous animals with 
which the present account has made us acquainted, was an 
universal catastrophe that embraced the whole earth. All 
life was extinguished on the face of our globe ; a great epoch 
in the history of the earth was closed ; and the innumerable 
forms under which animal life now appears are the products 
of a new creation. In like manner, as in an older formation 
(Jura limestone), we see an inferior class of animals (Reptiles) 
appear with an extraordinary abundance and variety of forms 
and enormity of bulk ; so does this epoch, whose fauna has 
formed the subject of the present disquisition, display the 
culmination point of the highest class in the animal kingdom. 



PREVIOUS TO THE LAST GEOLOGICAL REVOLUTION. 387 

the mammalia. Their time is now past : poor and weak 
does this class appear in the actual order of creation, com- 
pared with what it was in the former. Thus was it deter- 
mined in the plan of Providence : the new theatre was des- 
tined to the development of a more exalted creature, the 
hour of whose appearance on the stage had sounded ; and 
the inordinate proportions of animal lite were reduced within 
their proper limits. Finally, the extreme degree of heat that 
had been so favourable to the increase of organic bulk, gave 
way to a milder temperature, that permitted the free deve- 
lopment of intelligence ; and the Human period succeeded 
the Mammalian. 

In order to complete this sketch, I will, in conclusion, 
offer a brief view of the contributions of other naturalists to 
our knowledge on the subject. The first specimens of the 
fossil remains of South America were brought home by Dom- 
bey. They consisted of a few teeth and a portion of the 
under jaw of a species of Mastodon, which Cuvier recog- 
nized as identical with that whose remains have been found 
in Europe, M. Angustidens. This important subject did 
not escape Baron Humboldt's attention : he brought back 
with him some remains of the same genus, which Cuvier 
discovered to belong to two new species, besides the one 
already mentioned; these he named M, Andium and M. 
Humboldtii, Baron Humboldt found the remains of the 
first in Peru and Columbia, of the second in Ecuador and 
Bolivia, of the last in Chili. In all these countries the 
existence of such huge animal bones had given rise to the 
story of giants; which is also a very ancient tradition in 
Brazil, and evidently arises from the same source. Long 
ago Father Casale, in his ' Corographia Brasilica,' vol. i. 
p. 78, speaks of gigantic bones being found near the Rio 
das Contas, in the province of Bahia; and MM. Spix 
and Martins inform us that these bones belong to the 
above genus. So also M. A. de St. Hilaire, in his ' Travels,* 
vol. ii. p. 314, describes a molar tooth of Mastodon which 
was discovered in the sertao of the River San Francisco. 
But the most important discovery, and which excited the 
greatest attention among naturalists, was undoubtedly that 
of the remains of the monstrous and gigantic animal, to 
which Cuvier has given the name of Megatherium. A 
nearly perfect skeleton of this animal was brought to light 
in the year 1789, very near Buenos Ayres, and was sent by 
the governor, the Marquis of Loretto, to Madrid, where it 
has been set up and now remains. Besides this, a second is 
said to have been sent to the same city in 1 795 from Lima, 



388 VIEW OF THE FAUNA OF liRAZIL 

together with some fragments of a third from Paraguay. 
Since that time, in consequence of the representations of 
Sir Woodbine Parish, the English consul-general at Buenos 
Ayresj excavations have been made along the banks of the 
river Salado, as also of the stream Villa Nueva, and the 
lake Las Aveiras, which have furnished fragments of three 
other skeletons of the same animal, and which have been 
deposited in the Museum of the Geological Society in 
London.^ Spix and Martius were the first who gave an 
account of the existence of fossil remains of Megalonyx in 
the caverns near the river S. Francisco. To M. Seilo are we 
indebted for the discovery of a gigantic species of Arma- 
dillo, extracted from the banks of the river Uruguay ; the 
fossils have been sent to Berlin, and have been described by 
Dalton ; but as I have not seen his account, I can give no 
further information of this animal. And finally, I must not 
omit the extract from a letter addressed to M. de St. Hilaire 
by Senhor Damasio Larranaga, and published in the second 
edition of Cuvier's ' Recherches,' vol. i. p. 191, in which he 
announces the discovery of several portions of Megatherium 
in the republic of Uruguay; which, however, evidently 
belong to a gigantic species of the Armadillo family, and^ 
as I suspect, to Chi amy dot her ium gigas. 

The above is a brief account of my predecessors in this 
line, so far as they have come to my knowledge in my pre- 
sent retired position. It is sufficient to show that the sub- 
ject was not new; the path had already been trodden by 
several respected naturalists ; and the glimmering of light 
which their discoveries had scattered over this wide field, 
were in a high degree calculated to wake the attention of 
philosophers, and to excite the desire to see these researches 
extended. It was my fortunate lot to be able to contribute 
towards the accomplishment of this desire ; but I acknow- 
ledge with gratitude, that if the facts described in the above 
pages have at all assisted in extending the boundaries of 
science, the merit thereof is due to the respected Society 
whose flattering encouragement gave me energy to overcome 
the difficulties of the undertaking, and whose generous as- 
sistance furnished me with the means of conducting my 
researches on such a scale as could alone lead to the desired 
results.

mands a supplementary notice. T have before mentioned 
that of each of the genera Cutia, Paca and Capivar, only 
a single species now exists in this district, whereas I have 
found two fossil species of Cutia and Capivar, and three of 
Paca ; that of each of these genera one species is of gigantic 
proportions, while the remainder correspond in size to the 
existing species. Again, 1 have there observed that of the 
two lesser species of Paca^, one resembles the living animal 
in its nearly smooth head, (although in the structure of its 
cranium it otherwise displays sufficient specific difference,) 
while the other species is distinguished by an extraordinary 
development of its zygomatic arches, as likewise by great 
inequalities on its cranium, I have at this moment received 
the cranium of a Paca, shot near Curvello, that exhibits all 
these characters of the fossil species, although a closer com- 
parison convinces me also, in this instance, of their specific 
distinction. I have quite satisfied myself that this develop- 
ment of the zygomatic arches and unevenness of the surface 
of the cranium are not the effect of age, by the examination 
of a connected suite of the smooth-headed Paca from the 
earliest to the most advanced age, in which all the sutures 
have disappeared ; whereas the cranium here spoken of be- 
longs to a young animal, in which the sutures are still di- 
stinct. Instead of this, I have reason to suspect, however 
little such a phsenomenon may appear to be supported by 
analogy, that this striking dissimilarity in the formation of 
the skull results only from a difference of sex. I rest this 
supposition on two principal facts ; first, because, with this 
single exception of the crania, I do not find in all the other 
bones belonging to the Paca the least dissimilarity to be- 
token the existence of two distinct species ; and, secondly, 
because the characters by which the fossil smooth-headed 
Paca is distinguished from the living, display a remarkable 
parallelism with the distinctions that characterize the rough- 
headed Paca of the same two periods. 

Should this supposition be confirmed, then the two species 
that I have described under the names of Cwlogenys rugiceps 
and C, laticeps, must be reduced to one, which may preserve 
the name laticeps, and the genus Paca will thus possess the 
same proportions as the genera Cutia and Capivar, 

1 Dr. Lund does not appear aware that there are now existing in South 
America two species or varieties of Paca (Coelogenys) , the skulls of which 
differ precisely as above described. These differences were first pointed out 
by Cuvier in the ' Annales du Museum/ torn. x. p. 203. pi. x. 



390 FLORA OF CENTRAL NORFOLK. 

Art. 111.— The Flora of Central Norfolk. By Mr. R. J. Mann. 

The county of Norfolk is, to the British naturalist, a field 
of abundant interest, in consequence of its forming one of 
the extremes of his native regions, in which the ocean marks 
out a defined boundary to the productions of the land, and 
changes, by its magic touch, the gaudy flower and waning 
grass into the green sea- weed. The botanic wealth of the 
most eastern point of England has been well displayed, in 
an admirable sketch of the natural history of Yarmouth, by 
the Messrs. C. and J. Paget. The present paper is' an at- 
tempt to supply the next link in the chain of gradation, 
which terminates only at the shores of Sutherland. It em- 
braces all those localities M^hich fall within the reach of an 
ordinary day's march of the working naturalist from the 
vital centre of the district, the city of Norwich. 

The substratum of Norfolk is identical with the great 
chalk formation of Europe, and its outcross constitutes the 
greater portion of the high ground of the county ; its edge 
is marked by a straight line, a little inclined from the north 
and south direction, and upon the central portion of this 
edge is built the ancient city of Norwich. The eastern in- 
clination of the cretaceous mass is covered by a series of 
beds composed chiefly of sand and loose ferruginous sand- 
stones, mixed with gravel containing abundance of organic 
remains, whose characters distinctly register their ocean 
birth. These marine sandstones, known technically as the 
Norfolk crag, occupy upon the surface a broad band running 
parallel to the boundary of the chalk, and not frequently 
raised to more than a few feet of elevation above the level of 
the sea. The space intervening between this tract and the 
German Ocean is partially occupied by irregular masses of 
gravel and clay, formed by the action of water upon the 
older rocks of the more western counties, and swept thence 
by diluvial currents to their present localities, leaving marks 
of their progress at various stages of their course ; at the 
same period that these waters were deluging the land, the 
then surface was channeled by some disturbing force into a 
series of valleys running more or less eastward, and uniting 
in that direction in a common termination. The next epoch 
in the history of these valleys must have presented them as 
estuaries of the German Ocean, their lower level being of 
necessity overflowed by its waters. In this state they appear 
to have remained until about the period of the Norman Con- 
quest, when, from some uncertain cause or causes, the sea 
retreated to about its present bounds, and the bottoms of the 



FLORA OF CENTRAL NORFOLK. 391 

valleys were raised, by alternate beds of moor and silt, to 
the high-water mark of the fresh streams that continue to 
drain through them. There are now three rivers meandering 
through the central tract of the estuaries that have preceded 
them, the lateral formations of moor and silt having been 
converted into valuable marsh and pasture lands ; that to 
the northward of the three is the Bure ; it is the most 
irregular in its course, and is connected with several shallow 
lakes that have been left where the silting process has been 
checked, or the draining less perfect. The second river is 
the Yare, which is rendered somewhat important by being 
navigable between Norwich and the sea-port of Yarmouth. 
The third river is the Waveney, which forms the natural 
boundary of the contiguous counties of Norfolk and Suffolk. 
At the confluence of these rivers a lake is formed, which 
reaches to within half a mile of the sea, then contracts again 
into a narrow stream, turns sharply to the south, and con- 
tinues its course for three miles in that direction, separated 
from the ocean by a low tongue of sand only, which is over- 
flown by the highest tides, and then suddenly empties itself 
into the German Ocean, where the cliffs of Suffolk com- 
mence to raise themselves above the flats of Norfolk. 

The botanical stations of the county all bear a direct rela- 
tion to the geological features which have been thus suc- 
cinctly sketched. 

In the immediate vicinity of Yarmouth the coast is a flat 
plain, but more to the north the sand has accumulated under 
the action of the wind and tide, and formed a line of sand- 
banks which offer a natural barrier to the encroachments of 
the ocean. In several positions these banks rise to a con- 
siderable height, and the labours of the plough may be seen 
to extend to within a quarter of a mile of the sea ; the safety 
to the agricultural district, from its close neighbourhood to 
these loose and mobile sands, being provided for by a series 
of grasses and sedges, (the most characteristic of which are 
the Carex arenaria and the Triticum junceum,) which inter- 
lace their creeping roots, often extending to the distance of 
many yards, and thus bind into a firm soil that which would 
otherwise render useless to the cultivator the inland country 
for miles. 

Somewhat more removed from the coast than these regions 
of sand, on the immediate banks of the lower parts of the 
rivers, and around the broader waters, is an extent of marsh 
ground entirely distinct from all other regions in its vegetable 
productions, in consequence of its being periodically over- 
flown by salt water. These are known as the Salt Marshes, 



392 FLORA OF CENTRAL NORFOLK. 

and are green during the summer with the wild celery, and 
gay in the autumn with the marsh mallow. The banks of 
the Yare, the Waveney, and the Bure, beyond the influence 
of the salt tides, are composed of marshy grovmd, in part 
putting on the appearance of loose bogs interspersed with 
firm tufts composed of the roots of Carices, rushes and grasses 
rising at intervals upon them. These are constantly drenched 
with water, and supported upon a subsoil of silt and turf of 
twenty feet in thickness. The marshes of Acley and Horn- 
ing present characteristic specimens. Proceeding upwards 
along the banks of the rivers, these wet bogs gradually pass 
into drier and more stable meadows, in which the sedges and 
rushes are almost banished by the true grasses. 

Some few miles to the north of Norwich is an extent of 
elevated heath and moor, in which are found the infant 
sources of the Bure. This tract is considerably higher than 
the level of the ancient estuaries, and in the summer as- 
sumes the appearance of a dry heath, yellow in the earlier 
months with the blossoms of the needle furze, but purple in 
August with the beautiful Calathian violet, the brilliant field 
being relieved at intervals by rusty spots of the sun dews, 
and interrupted occasionally by plantations of young pines, 
in which a constant war is waged between nature and man, 
the former in many instances appearing to have almost re- 
claimed that which had been abstracted from her domains. 
Throughout the winter these regions are almost entirely in- 
undated and inaccessible ; and if the adventurous botanist, 
remembering the summer gambols of the Lacerta agilis, and 
the treasures which he then reaped from the spot, should be 
induced to visit them at that period, they will afford to him 
the three species of Sphagna, and as much depth of the 
water in which they grow as he may please to wade into. 

The edges of the elevated grounds are still covered in 
many places by the remains of woods and groves which 
have served as preserves to many of the species of plants 
affecting such regions. 

Those districts which have fallen more immediately under 
the influence of man, and are employed for agricultural pur- 
poses, occupy all those portions of the chalk slopes and 
rising grounds which have been reclaimed from either heaths 
or woods, and of course constitute by far the larger portion 
of them. In these the native plants have been driven by 
the operations of husbandry into such corners as are unfitted 
for their purpose ; the soil is formed by varying admixtures 
of sand, clay, lime, and the oxide of iron, the sand having 
been chiefly derived from the beds of crag ; the clay from 



FLORA OF CKNTRAL NORFOLK. 393 

the cliluviiuii formed probably by tlie disintegration of the 
lias series of the inland counties ; the iron from the .same 
diluvial beds, and the lime from the exhaustless magazine 
afforded by the chalk. 

It will be readily imagined^ that a country presenting the 
physical features that have been now described, must be rich 
in botanical productions ; and that such is the case is proved 
by the details of wealth contained in the following List of the

Art. IV — A JReport on the Progress of Vegetable Physiology 
during tlw year 1837. By F. J. F. Meyen, M.D., Professor 
of Botany in the University of Berlin. Translated from the 
German by William Francis, Associate of the Linnaean 
Society. R. and J. E. Taylor. 

Our continental scientific brethren far exceed our own 
countrymen in the modes they adopt of making known the 
results of their researches to the world. Independently of a 
numerous and well-arranged series of journals^ under the va- 
rious titles of Journaux and Annales in France, and Annalen, 
Archiv, Repertoria, &c. in Germany, we see, emanating from 
the press of these respective countries, a series of scientific 
annuals in the shape of reports on the progress of science, 
edited by some scientific man, whose name in general is alone 
a sufficient guarantee for their accuracy. Even Sweden, 
under the auspices of Berzelius, is not only not behind-hand, 
but may be said to have set this excellent example; for 
eighteen years has the Jahres-bericht des Physischer Wissen- 
schaften regularly appeared at Stockholm; and every Euro- 
pean chemist and philosopher has for as many years hailed 
its appearance as a most valuable source of information, em- 
bodying, in a volume of some 400 pages, an abstract of all 
the researches made in the different departments of experi- 
mental science during the preceding twelve months. In like 
manner various annual reports or Jahrbuchs of Pharmacy, 
Medicine, Botany, &c. regularly appear in different parts of 
Germany, and among them the Annual Report on the Pro- 
gress of Vegetable Physiology, by Prof. Meyen, holds a high 
and distinguished place. The naturalist, to whom, from ig- 
norance of the language in which it is written, this valuable 
Report must have remained a sealed book, cannot fail to re- 
ceive with pleasure this excellent translation from the pen of 
Mr. Francis. Few men are so well qualified to offer a trans- 
lation of Prof. Meyen's Report to the public as Mr. Francis ; 
for in addition to his familiarity with the German language, 
he possesses no mean acquaintance with the sciences to 
which the report is itself devoted, and he therefore must be 
distinguished from the great mass of translators, as feeling 
and understanding that which he has to clothe in an English 
garb. Prof. Meyen commences with a remark on the neces- 
sity of drawing a distinction between mere descriptive Botany 
and Phytology, or Vegetable Physiology, a distinction analo- 
gous to that which exists between Zoology and Comparative 
Anatomy. 



PROGRESS OF VEGETABLE PHYSIOLOGY. 409 

*' The study of Vegetable Physiology advances with rapid steps, the 
small number of its labourers annually increases, each year adds to the 
importance of its results ; and we already look forward to the time when a 
decided separation of vegetable physiology from descriptive botany must 
take place, for it appears that these two sciences cannot simultaneously 
be pursued by one and the same botanist to such an extent as the present 
time demands. The number of anatomico-physiological publications of 
the past year is extremely great ; and it is morphology especially which 
has engaged during that period the largv?st share of attention ; at present 
a contest awaits it similar to that which previously vegetable anatomy had 
to undergo, where not a single observation was admitted without opposi- 
tion. So also morphology must not be the work of speculation, but 
should be founded wholly and solely on the observation of nature ; studied 
in this way, it will become a doctrine easy to comprehend, which will en- 
large to a great extent our knowledge of the nature of plants. 

" From the active interest which has been taken in vegetable physiology, 
and from the immense increase of materials, this report becomes from year 
to year a more arduous undertaking ; as, however, it is of some utility for 
the diffusion of the science, the reader will kindly overlook those faults 
with which such a thankless task must always be accompanied. The in- 
terest evinced with regard to these reports both in England and in France 
by translations, as well as by the kind transmission of some memoirs, 
which otherwise would not have come so early under our view, convinces 
us that the naturalists of those countries will feel a greater desire to pos- 
sess a more general knowledge of our very numerous German labours in 
this branch of science, than heretofore." 

The first topic on which Prof. Meyen dilates is the series 
of extraordinary speculations of Von Martius, on the souls 
or spiritual life of plants. Here we have a specimen of that 
deep and alluring mysticism which our German neighbours 
are occasionally found mingling with rigid and demon- 
strative science. Witness the published opinions of Oken, 
Fries, Grots, Wagner, &C.5 or of Goldbeck, in his work on 
" The meaning of 0, or the first dawn of Light in the 
horizon of Truth." But these speculations, however curious, 
have perhaps too little practical interest for English readers 
in general. 

The Professor next passes in review the researches of 
Ohlert, on the naked spongioles terminating the fibrillse of 
roots ; the researches of Dutrochet on Endosmose, and on 
the circulation in Chara and Nitella ; and those of that very 
talented and excellent phytologist. Prof. Morren, of Liege, 
on the circulation of the sap in exogens. 

Dr. Schleiden's observations on the growth of plants in 
water saturated with carbonic acid, are next discussed; 
these deserve peculiar attention, as they may perchance throw 
some light on the supposed paradox of seeds germinating 
in mere i?iorganlc powders moistened with water. 

The peculiarities of the vessels carrying milky sap, as in 
Ficus, Euphorhia, &c., are next discussed; and the micro- 
scopic investigator will read a lesson of caution, froiri the

410 meykn's report for 18.37 ox the 

error into which M. Mandl fell, in mistaking the minute 
spiculfe present in such sap for animalcules. 

The section of the report devoted to Vegetable Anatomy 
is extremely ample, and contains a most valuable amount of 
information. One or two extracts from the most novel por- 
tions will at once afford a specimen of the lucid manner in 
which this subject is treated, and make known some of the 
most interesting discoveries to our readers. 

" M. Mohl has published a memoir on the structure of the porous ves- 
sels of dicotyledons, and I have also treated of this subject in my fifth 
chapter, but I have called these porous vessels dotted spiral tubes. 

^' M. Mohl adopts two varieties of dotted spiral tubes ; in the one the 
walls are lined equally on both sides with dots or pores, according to 
M. Mohl's statement ; the oak, alder, &c., offer examples ; while in the 
other variety the tubes exhibit a totally different structure at various parts, 
as in the lime, the Italian poplar, and in many other woods. In the lime, 
the walls of these ducts, which abut on the ligneous cells, have all the ap- 
pearance of spiral tubes capable of unrolling ; while the other walls, by 
means of which these vessels cohere among themselves, exhibit the series 
of dots which are always situated between two convolutions of spiral fibre. 
It is evident, therefore, from these observations, says M. Mohl, that the 
dotted spiral ducts belong to the system of spiral tubes and the most 
essential part of their formation consists in this : — that between the coils 
of the spiral fibre there is a dilated membrane, on which, between every 
two fibres, a series of dots is situated. According to my view, all the 
coils of spiral fibres are clothed with a fine membrane, and the coils of 
fibre take some part in the formation of the dots by reciprocal cohesion. 
In proof that the dotted spiral tubes belong to the system of true spiral 
tubes, I have mentioned a case in the stem of a gourd, where at times the 
large spiral tubes are not metamorphosed into dotted tubes, which in this 
plant is otherwise very frequently the case. 

" M. Mohl does not consider it as improbable that the thickening of 
the membrane of spiral vessels may be effected by the deposition of new 
layers upon their inner surface, exactly as with the thickening of cellular 
membrane ; and I have actually observed this in several cases, representa- 
tions of which are given in my Vegetable Physiology, PI. III. figs. 15, 16. 

" M. Mohl and I also agree in the explanation of the structure of the 
dots, namely, that they are formed precisely in the same way as the large 
dots of coniferous and cycadeous wood ; this indeed could not but be 
expected with the use of such perfect instruments ; for most of the incor- 
rect observations of former times can only be ascribed to the defective 
microscopes of that period. 

" M. Mohl compares the development of the porous vessels with that 
of cells, as series of thin-sided cell-like cavities constitute their base, in 
which the spiral fibres are then formed. M. de Mirbel had already started 
a similar notion, that vessels are formed from cells, and the observation of 
the porous tubes in the earliest stages of their development is said to 
prove this. About this time the individual cells are frequently found per- 
fectly closed, and the thin membranous diagonal partitions subsequently 
disappear, while they remain in many cases during the whole lifetime of 
the plant, but take a structure quite different from that of the lateral par- 
titions, which has already been demonstrated in various plants. I am 
well acquainted with the cases which might lead observers to the above 
views, but I also know of numerous cases in which the very opposite may 
be observed, where both the simple as well as the metamorphosed con-

tinuous spiral tubes separate in the course of development more or less 
completely by constriction, and form articulations arranged in series. 

" The cross partitions of the single articulations of the metamorphosed 
spiral tubes are either broken through by a very large aperture or by a 
number of fissures and longitudinal pores : nay, even the oblique partitions 
of the large dotted tubes in the vyrood of some species of Ephedra are 
pierced, and that by the large round holes, vv^hich generally occur in them 
arranged in two parallel rows. M. Mohl observes that phytotomists have 
considered these horizontal sides as lateral sides of the tubes, which was 
also probably owing to bad instruments, for the inclination of these hori- 
zontal walls to the lateral is so exceedingly small, that they may even be 
regarded as inclined terminal surfaces of the prosenchymatous cells, with 
which the superposed cells stand in connexion ; I at least have declared 
in favour of this latter opinion. The disappearance of the horizontal walls 
in the dotted spiral tubes is, as M. Mohl thinks, to be compared to the 
formation of the vessels of the latex, which also are said to originate from 
cells standing above one another, as M. linger (see p. 30) has tried to 
render probable by a drawing. The most varied views exist however on 
this subject, and are as diametrically opposed to one another as those on 
the metamorphosis of the spiral tubes. According to M. Schultz, con- 
strictions and the formation of articulations of the proper vessels originate 
with the advancing age of the plant ; in the young state these vessels were 
still unarticulated. According to my observations, the proper vessels are 
neither in their youth nor old age provided with cross partitions, but ex- 
hibit in the latter state some constrictions which are independent of exter- 
nal circumstances. According to M. Mohl, the continuous vessels of the la- 
tex originate from cells, whose cross partitions disappear ; to which, in con- 
sequence of numerous researches on this subject, I am decidedly opposed. 

" The distinction between dotted and reticulated spiral tubes consists, 
according to M. Mohl, in this : — that in the latter the organic matter used 
for the further development of the vessels does not deposit itself in the form 
of a membrane between the coils of the spiral fibre, but goes to increase 
the spiral fibre itself, both with respect to its thickness as well as to its 
breadth. In the dotted (porous) spiral ducts of dicotyledons, on the con- 
trary, this substance is deposited in the form of a membrane between the 
coils of the spiral fibre on the original membrane of the vessel. 

" Neither can I concur in these statements : the thickening of the walls of 
both those stages of metamorphosis of the spiral tubes takes place in quite 
a similar manner ; the principal reason for the change into reticulated and 
into dotted spiral tubes is to be found only in the arrangement of the indi- 
vidual coils of the spiral fibre. If the coils are widely apart, they may fall 
merely into annular tubes, or be metamorphosed into reticulated spiral 
tubes ; on the contrary, if the coils are close together, only striped and 
dotted spiral tubes, and' not reticulated, can originate. This is very easily 
confirmed in stems of Cacti, in the inflorescence of Musa, &c." 

The beautiful observations of Schwann^ on the presence of 
a fungus, Sacc/iaromyces, in fluids undergoing the vinous 
fermentation, are too important to be passed over without 
notice, even in a brief review : — 

" He saw in the beer-yeast most globules cohering in series ; they were 
partly round, but for the most part oval granules of a yellowish-white 
colour (they are perfectly colourless in achromatic instruments. — Rep.), 
which partly occur singly, but generally in series of 2 — 8 or more. Usu- 
ally one or more distinct series branch off obliquely on such a series. In 
short, the whole is an articulated and ramified plant. M. Schwann ob- 



Ill' A U±:i'ORT ON THE 

.scrvt'd tliat the new articulations grew forth at the ends of the terminal 
articulations, as the articulations to form new branches were emitted 
laterally. During the fermentation of the expressed juice of the grape 
similar plants were observed, which presented but a small dift'erence from 
those of the beer-yeast, only that such long threads as are perceptible in 
the latter were not noticed in the vinous fermentation. In the recently 
expressed juice nothing of these plants is perceptible ; at 20° they may be 
observed in thirty-six hours, and M. Schwann could observe the increase 
of their volume under the microscope in the interval of from half an hour 
to an entire hour ; they are here more globular, and generally only two 
are adherent together. 

" I have also been able to observe the growth of new articulations from 
the ends of older ones in plants from beer-yeast, and also in vinous 
and apple ferments. The process is very interesting, and may be followed 
completely ; the individual articulations subsequently separate and again 
grow on under favourable circumstances. Each articulation of this plant 
is a distinct independent plant, which immediately continues to grow 
when disturbed in its adherence ; or each articulation must be regarded as 
a spore of the plant. If the single articulations, in which state the plants 
in the thick beer-yeast are generally found, are mixed in the mash, they 
continue to grow, and in thinner fluids the plants become very large ; 
their branches extend radiately in all directions. I boiled the plants from 
beer-yeast for ten minutes, and yet I observed their further development 
when again brought under the microscope ; and M. Cogniard-Latour ex- 
posed them to various degrees of cold ; but even after the action of a cold 
90° cent, they still retained the property of decomposing sugar. 

"¦ Similar plants occur in cider ferment ; they are articulated and rami- 
fied in the same way as in the beer-yeast, but their joints are mostly three 
times as broad as long, and I also observed on them an increase by mere 
separation, although rarely. 

" M. Schwann demonstrates the connexion between the fungus de- 
scribed and vinous fermentation : however it is probably yet too soon 
to explain the pheenomena of fermentation from their development ; first, 
because the formation of the fungus is carried on much earlier than the 
development of carbonic acid in the fermenting fluid, and then there are 
several other plants which are developed more or less at the same time 
with them in the fermenting fluid, several of which, in connexion with 
the former, are described under the untenable genus Mycoderma, Persoon 
and Desmazieres ; nay, if the supposed species of Mycoderma had not been 
figured by Desmazieres, we certainly should never have had a clear notion 
of them. Desmazieres described a Mycoderma vini, glutinis farinulce , malti- 
juniperi, malti-cerevisicB, and cerevisicp ; but here two entirely distinct things 
are constantly united which do not at all belong to one another ; namely, 
the small articulated fungus previously mentioned, which we call Saccharo- 
myces after M. Schwann's proposal, and form at present the species Sac- 
charomyces vini, cerevisice and pomorum, occurring in all fermenting sub- 
stances, together with a larger confervoid one, the formation of which is 
also in many respects highly remarkable. To this place belongs the con- 
fervoid fungus which Amici observed in the sap of the weeping vine, the 
growth of which also takes place very rapidly, so that the elongation can 
be observed in a few minutes. This confervoid fungus is more or less 
shortly articulated in various fermenting substances, frequently unarticu- 
lated and unramified for some length, and then the articulations form at the 
branches, frequently over the whole thread at more or less regular di- 
stances, and then again, especially towards the end of the branch, the arti- 
culations swell to a globular form, subsequently disunite, and again de- 
velope to new plants ; yet rarely will two fluids be found in which these

plants are quite similarly circumstanced. In the expressed juice of a 
Borsdorfer apple, a fungus of this kind, of great beauty, was formed toge- 
ther with the Saccharomyces ; several large, almost globular flocks, fre- 
quently of the size of a pea, were present in the fluid, which were sepa- 
rated from one another, and always consisted of a very large, or rather in- 
numerable coils, of such single confervoid fungi, at the basis probably 
adherent. I observed this very interesting form for many weeks, and 
placed a single flock in a watch-glass with pure water, and so that the 
branches came to lie close at the surface ; to prevent the evaporation of 
the water the whole was covered with a plate of glass. In the lapse of 
from eight to ten days new radiate bundles were evident, and among these 
might be obsei^ved several which proceeded from the globular separated 
articulations of the original confervoid fungus, while others had developed 
fruit and represented nothing else than Mucor Mucedo when growing in 
water."

Martins on Morphology, the fairy-like, although most im-

A History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London Clay. By 
James Scott Bowerbank, F.G.S. Van Voorst, London : 1840. 

Seldom has a book made its appearance in the scientific 
world so completely combining the attractions of beautiful 
illustrations with carefully accurate technical descriptions, 
as Mr. Bowerbank's Essay on the Fossil Fruits of Bri- 
tain. The author has characterized one hundred and six 
species, comprising twelve genera, being a greater number 
than have been noticed by the whole of the previous writers 
on the subjects. An attentive examination of the different 
forms will well repay the geologist or botanist for the trouble ; 
he will find some of them — for instance, Mimosites, JVipU" 
dites, and Legimiinosites, closely allied to existing genera ; 
while others are anomalous in their structure, and belong to 
types totally extinct. Faboidea, although possessing the 
form common to many true leguminous seeds, presents us 
with characters wholly dissimilar to those of any existing

414 BOWERBANK. — FOSSIL FRUITS AND SEEDS. 

legume that lias yet been discovered. In the whole of these 
curious extinct legumes there exists a singular funiculus, 
passing for a considerable space beneath the testa before it 
emerges from the seed. The genus Hightea again presents 
lis with a series of highly interesting fruits, resembling in 
a few characters some of the MalvacecE,h\\i{[\^Qvir\gho\x\ them 
in so many important respects, that it is a task of great dif- 
ficulty to assign them their true place with anything ap- 
proaching to certainty. 

Mr. Bowerbank has done all that could be done by micro- 
scopic investigations, minutely and elaborately recorded, to 
elucidate the structure of these curious members of an ex- 
tinct Flora. We particularly refer the reader to the seventh 
plate, and to the descriptions, from pages 25 to 31. A 
few true melons are given under the name Ciicumites, and 
the entire structure of these fruits is described, even to the 
fine membranous arillus which surrounds the seeds. Of 
true Leguminosce eighteen species are described, and the 
situation and form of every characteristic part of the seed 
are detailed and figured with wonderful precision : on one 
specimen (see p. 134) Mr. Bowerbank has even detected the 
attack of some pisivorous beetle, probably a Bi^uchus. The 
plates are beautifully executed by Mr. J. de C. Sowerby : in 
the one re-published in the " Illustrations of the Magazine of 
Natural History,'' are represented some most interesting 
Proteaceous cones, closely resembling those of the existing 
genus Petrophila, a native of New Holland. 

There is one point of view in which we must hail Mr. 
Bowerbank's work as one of great importance, we alJude to 
the light which it throws on the nature of the climate of this 
portion of the globe at the period of the deposit of the Lon - 
don clay : the general character of the fruits is tropical, and 
hence we are led to infer that our island, — if island it then 
was, — must at the period of their ripening have enjoyed the 
influence of a vertical sun. 

The author has spared neither labour nor expense in 
getting up the work, and we hope that sufficient encourage- 
ment may be given him by the purchase of this first number 
to induce the speedy publication of the remainder in a style 
equally beautiful and complete. 



SHORT COMMUNICATIONS. 

NEW METHOD OF DRYING SPECIMENS OF PLANTS. 

About five years since I accidentally discovered the follow- 
ing method of drying specimens of plants ; and not having 
seen it mentioned in any work, and also being able to pro- 



NEW METHOD OF DRYING SPECIMENS OF PLANTS. 415 

cure finer specimens by this method than by any other witli 
which I am acquainted, I feel desirous of making it public 
for the benefit of other botanists. The only apparatus neces- 
sary is half a ream, or a ream of brown paper, and a quire 
of double-crown cap paper. I have found that size com- 
monly called "royal," to be the most useful size for the 
brown paper ; it should be tolerably smooth, and that of the 
weight of about fifty-five pounds per ream will be the best 
thickness. The cap paper should be rather porous in its 
texture, and not too thick. It may be cut into half-sheets, 
and each of these may be folded. The plan of proceeding will 
then be this : — First, lay down upon a board or table a quire 
of the brown paper ; lay upon it one of the folded half-sheets 
of cap paper, between which the plant is to be laid out 
in the usual way; then place over it half a quire of the 
brown paper, and then another half- sheet of cap paper, with 
a plant in it, then another half- quire of brown, and so on till 
all the specimens are laid in. (Unless the specimens are 
very large, several might be laid between each half-quire.) 
Finally, place the remainder of the brown paper on the top 
of the stack. Should the number of specimens requiring to 
be dried at one time be very great, it may perhaps be suf- 
ficient to lay a quarter of a quire between the specimens ; 
but I should give the preference to half a quire. The time 
which specimens will require to dry on this plan will of course 
vary according to the nature of the plants, and the dryness of 
the weather ; but in general a week will be sufiicient in tolera- 
bly fine weather. The great advantage in this plan appears to 
me to be this : — the brown paper being very flexible in every 
direction, exerts an equal pressure on every part of the plant 
to be pressed, while in the common way of drying plants 
(a board being used to give the principal pressure), consider- 
able force is exerted on the prominent and more elevated 
parts of a specimen, such as the stem, &c., while the leaves 
and thinner parts frequently shrivel in many plants, the thick- 
ness of the stem, &c. preventing an adequate pressure from 
being applied to them. This I have frequently found to be 
the case in plants with a woody stem, as Bideiis tripartita, 
Senecio Jacohcea, and aquaticus, Pteris aquilina, Eiq^ato- 
rium cannahinum, &c. &c. By the above method these dif- 
ficulties are completely obviated.

Note on Mr. Blyth's Paper, p. 370 of this Number. 

It is probable that the Brooksian Gnoo will proye to be the Wadau of 
Capt. Lyon {' Travels in North Africa,' pp. 76, 271), who mentions a chain 
of mountains to the south of Fezzan of that name, " on account of the im- 
mense number of Buffaloes to be found there, and which are of three spe- 



416 NOTE ON Mil. BLYTh's PAPKU 



cies ; viz. the Wadau, an animal of the size of an Ass, having very large 
(or, as is elsewhere stated, very long, heavy) horns, and large bunches of 
hair hanging from each shoulder, to the length of 18 in. or 2 ft.; they 
have very large heads, and are very fierce. The Bogua-el-Wecih, which is 
a kind of Buffalo, slow in its motion, having very large horns, and being of 
the size of an ordinary Cow ; and the White Buffalo, of a lighter and more 
active make, very shy and swift, and not easily procured. The calving 
time of these animals is in April and May." 

It is scarcely necessary to observe that the word Buffalo is most vaguely 
applied by many persons to any animal in some degree approaching to an 
Ox in form, but which is different from an Ox ; thus, in America, the Bi- 
son of that country is so termed, and to make the matter worse, as the 
animal inhabits the same districts as the so-called Indian, a paragraph 
lately went the round of the newspapers of somebody in this country pos- 
sessing several " Indian Buffaloes" in his park, whereas American Bisons 
were intended ; and the large or Brahminy breed of Zebras is likewise com- 
monly so called by English graziers. Moreover, Capt. Lyon notices (at 
p. 44.) that all the grazing animals of Barbary " have the power of re- 
maining a great length of time without drinking," as indeed is the case 
with the upland-feeding sheep of this country. " Antelopes and Buffaloes," 
he adds, " I should conceive in some cases never touch water, none being 
found on the surface of the desert, and they are unable to obtain that which 
is in the wells," to which the Carnivora. constantly resort. Hence it is ob- 
vious that the semi-aquatic beasts, correctly termed Buffaloes, cannot be 
alluded to ; and with respect to those really intended, it may be remarked 
that unless they feed on very succulent herbage, it is impossible that they 
should remain long without drinking : witness the dreaded TacJc-bokken, 
or migrations of the springbok (Gazella euchore') in South Africa, when 
the brackish pools to which they ordinarily resort are dried up ; or 
the narration of J. Wilkinson, Esq. (' Journ. Geog. Soc.,' II. 49.), of a 
troop of common Gazelles (G. dorcas) passing through his encampment 
at Guttar, in the eastern Egyptian desert, which was their only route to 
the spring, and returning the same way. Even the Camel, if I may con- 
tinue the digression, notwithstanding its peculiar organization and express 
training for this very object, cannot, at the utmost, endure more than five 
days total abstinence from water (vide Burnes' ' Travels in Bokhara,' II. 
18, 179; and ' Edin. New Phil. Journ.,' 1832, 192.) ; unless, indeed, it 
meet with a supply of succulent herbage, which, if in sufficient quantity, 
precludes all necessity for drinking (vide Wellsted's 'Travels in Arabia,' I. 
298; Russell's 'Nat. Hist. Aleppo/ 56, &c.). Thus it is that the con- 
flicting statements of various trustw^orthy authorities may be reconciled 
without resorting to the scepticism of Burckhardt (vide ' Biography,' of 
that estimable traveller, prefixed to ' Travels in Nubia,' p. Ixxiii.) ; and it 
is worthy of being noticed, that Buffon mentions four days as an extraor- 
dinary period for a Camel to remain without drinking. 

To return, however, to the "Buffaloes" of Capt, Lyon. As it is clear 
that these are not Buffaloes, it remains to observe that the third^species is 
obviously the White Oryx, as noticed by Col. H. Smith ; the second is as 
plainly either the common North African Bubalio, or, more probably, an 
allied species with which I am acquainted, as yet undescribed ; and the 
first is also undescribed, or at most but indicated, probably as the Brook- 
sian Gnoo of Col. H. Smith, to which genus it would certainly seem to 
belong, and also as the Pegasus of Pliny, or " winged horse of Ethiopia, 
armed with horns," the Pagasse, Pacasse, Empacasse, &c., of various wri- 
ters of the last and preceding centuries, and the Bos} pegasus, of Col. Ha- 
milton Smith ; its " large bunches of hair hanging from each shoulder, to 
the length of 18 in. or 2 ft.", according to Capt. Lyon, doubtless originat- 
ing the notion of its being winged.

APPENDIX 

TO THE 

THIRTY-NINTH NUMBER 

OF THE 

NEW SERIES 

OF THE 

MAGAZINE OF NATURAL HISTORY 

BY THE EDITOR. 



The Editor of the 'Entomological Magazine,' in termina- 
ting that journal with the completion of the fifth volume, 
and in voluntarily coming forward to render some ac- 
count of his stewardship, tells us, he has resolved upon re- 
linquishing on this occasion, the editorial plural, that he 
may address his brother entomologists in the more ego- 
tistical but less assuming singular. My intercourse with 
those who peruse the columns of the * Magazine of Natu- 
ral History' has not yet, in point of duration, placed me 
in the same relative position as that lately occupied by 
my friend, Mr. Newman : — still, the period has been long 
enough to make me think that, for once, I also may throw 
aside the attribute in question, and may venture to address 
the readers of this journal, not as the representative of those 
who contribute, or of those who subscribe to its pages, and, as 
such a representative, wielding a power that does not attach 
itself to the abstract expression of individual sentiment ; — but 
in the character simply of a student in the glorious domain 
of nature, anxious, with them, to drink at the sources of sci- 
entific knowledge, and, at the same time not forgetful that to 
add something, however trivial, towards widening the stream 
as it flows from the fountain, is the sole return that can be 
made, for having tasted of its waters. 

The position I am about to place myself in, — that of 
principal in a cause which will stand recorded as " Charles- 
worth versus Lyell and Owen," but which, perhaps, might 
be more justly designated as "Lyell and Owen versus Charles- 
worth," — is one, that with those who may not care to sift the 
matter for themselves, will probably lay^ me open to unfa-

vorable animadversion. I must naturally expect that in 
some quarters no exertion will be spared to affix a false 
construction upon the motives which have prompted my 
adoption of the present measure. The only contingency 
however, of this kind, about which I feel the slightest ap- 
prehension, is the chance of its being thought that I have 
come forward with the present history, under a vain con- 
ceit that details relating to the character of an Editor, in 
his capacity of a private individual, must necessarily be 
interesting from the vast importance attached to such a 
personage. Now, whilst I am far from affecting indif- 
ference to the possible tone of general rumour, I yet feel 
that the necessity for carrying out the course which I have 
determined on, does not originate in the relation in which 
I am placed to the scientific public at large, but in the 
relation existing between myself and that fraction only of 
the scientific public to which the journal under my con- 
troul owes its existence — the subscribers and contributors 
to the Magazine. I plead guilty to the possession of so 
much vanity as confidently to hope that their interest in 
the reputation of the individual whom they have entrusted 
with the editorship of the periodical in question, is such as 
will not allow them to rest satisfied, without a critical exa- 
mination of the real circumstances which have given rise to 
this proceeding, at least in so far as those circumstances can 
be judged of from the evidence which will be placed before 
them : and, in committing this statement into their hands, 
and in some measure investing them with the separate 
functions of judge and jury, I do so, under the full con- 
sciousness that if the nature of their verdict be not in my 
favour, it is sure to be conveyed to me through a chan- 
nel which is open to no posslhilitij of misapprehension. 

The major part of those whom I am addressing, may 
possibly have had their attention arrested by a notice on 
the wrapper of the December Magazine, (No. 36), and in 
that case, they will perhaps have already anticipated that 
the coiTcspondence there announced for publication, is to form 
the chief topic of discussion throughout the present enquiry. 
In giving that intimation of the course which seemed to me 
under the circumstances the only consistent, and the most 
direct one to pursue, I was guided by two considerations. — 
First, the making known to such as might by ex-parte ru- 
mours hear of the matter, that publicity would be given to 
its details ; — and, secondly, that of affording the interested 
parties on the other side, full notice of my determination, 
and an opportunity of suggesting some arrangement, should

any wish exist on their part to avert the present pub- 
lication. But before I proceed to the correspondence, 
or touch upon the immediate details with which it is 
associated, 1 must in passing, say a word upon the pe- 
culiar position occupied by the Editor of a scientific 
periodical ; and I must refer to circumstances either di- 
rectly arising from my connection with the Magazine, or 
which have occurred to me since the direction of that 
journal was first committed to my charge : — circumstan- 
ces which, though they never can be wholly discarded 
from my recollection, I had ceased to look upon, but as 
of bye-gone times, only noted down in the pages of my 
own memory. Now however, they must be ushered into 
daylight. — They now assume an importance which makes 
it imperative in me not to slur them over, since, by so do- 
ing, I should leave the door open for it to be said, that 
though on this occasion I had come forward with an ap- 
parent vindication, there were things of earlier date which I 
had prudently never ventured to discuss, — never attempted 
to grapple with. 

The Editor of a scientific journal, and the conductor 
of a periodical devoted to general literature, respectively 
occupy ground so widely dissimilar, that in the title of 
their avocations is to be found the main relation of agreement 
between them. As it regards the degree of intellectual ac- 
quirement, necessary to qualify them for their respective du- 
ties, they are placed on the same footing ; but farther than 
this the parallel does not necessarily hold. The majority 
of contributors to the latter class of publications, transfer 
their ideas to paper as an honorable means of subsistence, 
elaborating the materials according to the greater or less 
demand for the supply. The great mass of readers read 
for self-instruction or amusement, and the object gratified 
they look no farther. TJieir interest in the contingent cir- 
cumstances attending the publication of the periodical they 
purchase, only extends to its regular appearance on the 
first day of the month ; and should it retire from the stage, 
the event merely gives them an opportunity of making a 
fi:esh selection from amongst a hundred others. Who the 
Editor may chance to be, or anything relating to him, forms 
as little an object of their consideration as the name of 
the founder who casts the type, or that of the manufacturer 
who supplies the paper. But in that restricted section of peri- 
odical literature, whose constitution differs from that of the 
general mass, inasmuch as the results of ohservation are 
here at a premium, and those of imagination at a dis- 



4 APPENDIX. 

count, another order of things predominates. It is here 
that we find the savant who has reached the highest pin- 
nacle of fame, and the humblest tyro destined perhaps 
never even to cross the threshold of her temple, alike 
registering the share of information which each respec- 
tively has gleaned from the treasury of nature. If it be want- 
ed that the result of individual research, secured to its 
discoverer, shall rapidly circulate, and be sent forth simul- 
taneously to every quarter in which homage is tendered at 
the shrine of science, here it is that a channel is found 
by which that object is made sure. It is the apprecia- 
tion of this boon, on the part of those who are at work 
in the field of phj^sical research, and the consciousness 
they possess, that these records of philosophical discovery 
are far from being sources of wealth to their responsible 
originators, which forms here a tie between Editor and 
Contributor, that elsewhere is unknown. Both are as- 
sisting, though in different ways, to further the same ex- 
alted object, and the innate satisfaction arising from this 
source, repays the appropriation of time and exertion which, 
in one sense, might often be far more profitably employed. 
It is here again that an Editor, in virtue of his position, ne- 
cessarily becomes a party to the results which others have ar- 
rived at, before those results are communicated to the world 
at large ; and whether their nature be one embracing simply 
matters of fact, or those of philosophical induction, the power 
of hastening or retarding the acquirement of a title to them 
by their rightful owners, within certain limits, is vested in 
himself. A knowledge of this, and of the opportunities 
which an Editor must sometimes have at his command, 
w^ere he disposed unduly to exercise the power thus en- 
trusted to him, brings with it the necessity for a firm be- 
lief, on the part of the contributors, that their confidence 
will not be abused. An individual, mixing in that sphere of 
society wherein the less exact sciences are professedly made 
the leading object of cultivation, may be willing, or perhaps 
even ambitious of singly incurring the risk and labor attend- 
ant upon the direction of a scientific periodical ; but he will 
seek in vain to draw around him that class of supporters, 
whose contributions alone can make a journal stand high 
in public estimation, unless he enjoy a reputation dis- 
tinct from that which forms the mere attribute of philoso- 
phical attainment. 

T took the Editorship of the Magazine of Natural History at 
a period in the career of life which, if not the most mature^ 
is perhaps the most sanguine — the transition from youth to

manhood. I became acquainted with the later volumes of 
the first series whilst studying in the metropolis, with a 
view of legally qualifying myself for the practice of an ac- 
tive profession; and though their contents could not fail to 
interest me, I sometimes thought that a firmer tone might 
be given to the work, by a more careful selection of 
materials, and, as a general rule, the omission of un- 
authenticated contributions. Hearing accidentally in the lat- 
ter part of the year 1836, that a gentleman who assisted Mr. 
Loudon in the general editorship of the magazine, was about 
to leave the neighbourhood of London, I obtained a letter of 
introduction, and voluntarily offered my services, which were 
accepted, and my proposal also agreed to, that a second se- 
ries should be issued, to commence in January, 1837, Mr. 
Loudon continuing proprietor, and, of course, taking all the 
pecuniary responsibility incurred by the publication.^ Popu- 
lar and elementary Natural History was then being diffused 
through the medium of light publications, in a very cheap 
form ; and I was convinced, both as a matter of policy and 
inclination, that my course was, if possible, to make the se- 
cond series embrace a larger share of the philosophy of the 
science, and a greater amount of those descriptive details 
which should enhance its absolute value to practical natural- 
ists. The prospect of success, however, was anything but 
flattering. Dr. Johnstone, who had long been one of Mr. 
Loudon's most valuable contributors, had just united with 
Sir Wm. Jardine to conduct a newly-established journal, — 
the * Magazine of Zoology and Botany,' carrying with him 
several more correspondents disposed to give the preference 
to that one of the two Magazines, which promised to take 
the higher stand as a scientific periodical. And about the 
same time another section of Mr. Loudon's supporters, com- 
prising some of the most frequent contributors to the Maga- 
zine, had apparently taken under their patronage a rival peri- 
odical, — 'The Naturalist.' A few of the original correspondents 
were still remaining, but how they might feel towards a strange 
editor, was, of course, altogether problematical. Under these 
disadvantages, and without the possibility of forcing a supply 
of communications, by proposals of pecuniary remuneration ; 
with no other weight attached to my name than its influence 
among a circle of friends, taking a warm interest in the culti- 
vation of similar pursuits, I entered on my new avocation. 

1 At the close of the year 1838, the proprietorship of the Magazine was 
transferred into my own hands, and the pecuniary responsibility has from 
that period entirely rested with myself. 



6 APPENDIX. 

The present month brings with it the thirty-ninth number 
of the second series, and within this as yet brief career of its 
existence, nearly two hundred of those with whom Natural 
History forms a leading study or an occasional recreation, have 
registered their observations on its pages. Large as this num- 
ber is, the amount itself carries with it no peculiar virtue ; but 
considering how great is the proportion upon the list, whose 
scientific reputation is firmly established, and that it in- 
cludes many of the most distinguished naturalists of the 
day, I cannot help feeling that my original ambition has 
been even more than realized. But could I then have known 
what I now know, of the history of scientijic natural-history 
periodicals ; — could I have foreseen the nerve that sometimes 
must be exercised, w^hen, single-handed, and without exten- 
sive resources, an editor determines, under all circumstances, 
and at all hazards, to follow one undeviating course of fear- 
less independence ; — I should indeed have shrunk from w^hat 
I was undertaking. 

Disappointments have occurred to me, that no share of 
foresight could have averted ; and attempts have occasionally 
been made to crush the Magazine, in quarters where they 
might least have been expected to originate : but still, I en- 
tertain the idea, that it will never prove to me a source of 
regret, that I should have stepped forw^ard to carry on a peri- 
odical, of which the sphere of usefulness might otherwise 
have been suspended. The dark spots on the surface of the 
picture, are not so numerous as to obscure the brighter por- 
tions. And at whatever period the relation in which I now 
stand to a large and influential section of British natural- 
ists, may be destined to terminate, — the intellectual enjoy- 
ment that I have derived from intercourse with those who, 
in many instances, previously unknown to me, have so cor- 
dially seconded the promotion of my object, must always 
form a bright page in the book of retrospection. 

I have spoken of the establishment of two journals in the 
year 1836, devoted to Natural History, and both of these 
w^ere critically noticed by me in the first number of the Ma- 
gazine which was issued with my name as its responsible 
Editor. ' Of the merits of the ' Magazine of Zoology and Bo- 
tany' T expressed the highest opinion; at the same time freely 
commenting on what I conceived to be the demerits of its 
cotemporary, the ' Naturalist.' I believed these two periodi- 
cals to differ, also, no less in relation to the ultimate objects 

»0f the first series, the three last niimhers only were edited hy myself, 
previously to which I had no connection with the work. 



APPENDIX. 7 

of their respective originators. The former, I have every rea- 
son to think, was really established solely with a view to tlie 
interests of science, and equally so that the latter was set on 
foot under an impression that the ' Magazine of Natural His- 
tory ' was a source of pecuniary emolument to Mr. Loudon, 
and that it might be supplanted by a vigorous attempt to 
win over its supporters to another journal. Mr. Mudie's 
highly entertaining article on the king-hsher, and other 
communications equally original, were, under these circum- 
stances, much too good to be lost sight of; but in saying 
what 1 did, I felt that if my criticisms were unjust, I was 
the only party who would be laughed at : — if candid, I 
was doing the * Natvu-alist' a service rather than an injury. 

The step taken by Mr. Loudon of commencing a new series 
of his journal, instead of respectfully withdrawing it out 
of deference to the new comers, had, no doubt, the effect of 
greatly disconcerting the projectors of the last-named perio- 
dical; and in this emergency one of the parties prominently 
concerned — Mr. Neville Wood — originated the following 
scheme, — to gull, if possible, some London jnihlisJier, upon the 
strength of a fabricated statement, wliicJt should be drawn 
up and furnished by Mr. Wood, into the belief that the 
' Magazine of Natural History^ might so easily be driven 
out of the field, as to ensure a highly-profitable speculation 
to any one who would attempt to effect this object by means 
of the ' Naturalist.' Mr. Wood, having been one of Mr. Lou- 
don's most frequent correspondents, and having also written 
an ornithological work for one of the most respectable pub- 
lishers in London (Mr. Parker), might naturally be supposed 
to know something of the real facts, and the gratuitous nature 
of the statement he was about to concoct, would therefore be 
less likely to excite suspicion. Various London publishers 
were accordingly written to, and the substance of Mr. Wood's 
applications may be gathered from the following specimen, 
copied verbatim, with the omission merely of the business- 
details relating to the circulation and expenses of the work. 

No. 1. 
Campsall Hall, near Doncaster, 

March 27, 1837. 
Sir, 

Tlie proprietorship of ' the Naturalist ' has lately become 
vacant ; and as it would be advantageous to have the work well supported 
in London, and knowing- your liberal spirit in such matters, I think it right 
to make you the first offer. * * * * If it were printed in London the 
sale would rapidly increase, so as to render it profitable. Loudon's Maga- 
zine now gives universal dissatisfaction ; and it is the opinion of all our best 
naturalists, that a spirited monthly Magazine, published and printed in Lon- 



8 APrENDTX. 

don, would compel that u'ork to discontinue at the close of the year. It has 
now very feiv advertisements, and Loudon has left it. * * * If you 
like to take it [the Naturalist], I promise to use my best efforts to en- 
crease its sale among- my numerous correspondents, and a better time there 
can scarce be for takint? the work, when Loudon's is so rapidly yoiny down 
in public estimation. Jardine's Magazine of Zoolog^y and Botany is two- 
monthly, and so dry and scientific as to have a very limited sale, and with 
the exception of the Naturalist, England cannot boast of a single good 
Magazine of Natural History. * * If it were printed in London, I am 
sure it would become profitable. 

I am, Sir, 

Your obedient Servant, 
NEVILLE WOOD. 

P. S. — I had proposed to send this through an M.P., but as the con- 
tents are important, think it better it should go direct.^ 



To Mr. 



Now for the reply of the party to whom the above appli- 
cation was addressed. 

No. 2. 

London, April 8, 1837. 
Sir, 

I have given your proposal consideration, and do not con- 
ceive it would be to my advantage to enter into any arrangement for the 
publication of the ' Naturalist.' I can have no wish in any way to discou- 
rage you, but I think it will be a matter of difficulty to supplant Loudon's 
Magazine. 

Your's ^c. 

Neville Wood, Esq. 

Campsall Hall. 

In the case of periodical works devoted to general litera- 
ture, and which are carried on so long as they are sources of 
pecuniary emolument to editors or publishers, the London 
booksellers can form a tolerably correct estimate of their re- 
spective stability by the number of copies which pass through 
their hands ; and hence little or no injury could be sustained 
by the private circulation of false information. But as it re- 
spects scientific journals, generally speaking, the number of 
copies sold is so limited that this criterion does not exist ; and 
Mr. Wood's statement that the new series of the * Magazine 
of Natural History' gave universal dissatisfaction, and that 
Mr. Loudon had ceased to have any connection with the 
work, might, under some circumstances, have been productive 

1 The ex-editor of the ' Naturalist' has placed himself in so critical a 
position by writing this, and sending other letters of a similar character, 
that I presume he will be very well satisfied to find himself arraigned be- 
fore no other bar than that of public opinion. 



APPENDIX. 9 

of real mischief, and so far, the fabrication was judiciously 
planned. At the very time, however, that Mr. Wood was 
writing to the London publishers, and informing them that 
all the naturalists of eminence considered the Magazine as 
worthless, he had the conscience to sand to me the following 
note : — 

No. 3. 

Campsall Hall, near Doncaster, 

April 4th, 1837. 
Mr. Neville Wood presents his compliments to Mr. Charlesworth, and 
would feel obliged by a notice of the ' Naturalist' in the ' Magazine of 
Natural History.' Mr. Wood's connection with the work commences with 
the enclosed number. 

However well Mr. Wood's scheme might be devised, it was 
altogether a failure in relation to the contemplated object, for 
the ' Natiu'alist ' continued to be printed in the country, and 
every succeeding month brought with it the names of new 
supporters to the Magazine which it was to have supplant- 
ed. The necessity for some yet more energetic measure was 
therefore apparent; and a plot was accordingly arranged, 
which, as a master-stroke of policy, threw the first altogether 
into the shade. Its nature was as follows. — To fabricate 
some statement tvJiich should be in the JiigJiest degree inju- 
rious to the personal character of the new editor of the Ma- 
gazine of Natural History ; then to write a long notice of 
the second series, speaking most favorably of its scientific 
merits, but at the close of the article cleverly introducing 
these fabricated particulars. To get the ivhole inserted in 
the literary department of some provincial newspaper, and 
to transmit by post, copies of this newspaper to the parties 
contributing to the new series of Mr. Loudon^ s journal. 

The conception of this plot was in every way admirable. 
It w^as a hundred chances to one that the editor of the pa- 
per would conceive it necessary to peruse a lengthy scientific 
notice, before the article went to press, and if any legal con- 
sequences ensued, the author of the fabrications had nothing 
to fear, — the legal responsibility falling on the publishers. 
Fifteen or twenty copies of the newspaper might be had for 
a few shillings ; — they would go postage-free ; — and if only 
half a dozen of them took effect, in occasioning that number 
of contributors to withdraw their support, it might at that pe- 
riod have been fatal to the existence of the Magazine. 

The project was boldly cut out, but most miserably carried 
into execution. For no sooner did the article appear in the 
* Sheffield Iris,' the newspaper selected for its introduction, 



10 APPENDIX. 

than Mr. Neville Wood reprinted the statement upon the co- 
ver of bis own journal, and sent presentation copies of that 
one number, to the scientific societies of London, where 
the new editor of the Magazine being well known, the for- 
gery was sure to be detected. A member of the Council of 
the Zoological Society brought the subject officially before 
the notice of that body, and tlie result was, that the then se- 
cretary received instructions to return the copy of the * Natu- 
ralist' to Mr. Wood, and to communicate to him by letter the 
determination of the Council, not to admit the work into the 
library of their Society. The records of our metropolitan 
scientific institutions probably do not furnish another instance 
of a presentation copy of a work beirig rejected, under cir- 
cumstances so discreditable to its author. 

Mr. Neville W^ood will probably say that Jiis pen did not 
furnish the manuscript to the ' Sheffield Iris,' nor his hand 
post the copies of that paper to their respective destinations ; 
but whether it w^as done by him or for him, is nothing to 
the purpose : that he was a party to the fabrication, it is im- 
possible to doubt ; for had he not been so, upon the return of 
the ' Naturalist' by the Council of the Zoological Society, he 
would of course have given some intimation, in a subsequent 
number of his journal, of there having been no foundation for 
the injurious statements refeiTcd to ; and which statements 
he had reprinted, protected by the cowardly manoeuvre, of 
qi^oting as an authority the columns of a provincial paper. 

From the editor of the 'Iris' I received the following 
letter. 

No. 4. 

Iris Office, Nov. 7, 1837. 

Sir, 

I received yours dated November 1st, and immediately endea- 
voured to make reparation for the mistake I had unintentionally permitted 
to appear in the Iris, by inserting an apology in the most conspicuous place 
of the same paper of this day, a copy of which I have forwarded to you by 
this day's post 

I regret exceedingly the misstatements, as I had not the slightest 
intention of doing any injury to the sale of the periodical you are connected 
with, or to Mr. Loudon, or to you, as a gentleman and an editor, through 
the pages of the Lis. I trust this, and the explanation in the Iris, will be 
deemed satisfactory. 

I remain. 

Your most obedient Servant, 

JOHN BRIDGEFORD. 

To what extent I may have sustained injury in quarters 
where personally Mr. Neville Wood and myself are alike un- 
known, I have no means of forming an opinion. I trusted 



APPENDIX. II 

that those who saw the article, either through an anony- 
niously-received copy of the Iris paper, or by a perusal of it 
on the wrapper of the ' Naturalist,' would exercise their dis- 
crimination, and judge of the probability of its truth, from 
the support alforcled me in my position as editor, by metro- 
politan naturalists immediately around me. 

The Rev^ W. T. Bree, whose interest in the prosperity of 
the Magazine I know to be undiminished, though, of late, he 
has been a less frequent contributor to its columns, volunta- 
rily observes, in a letter addressed to me in February, 1838, 
— "1 think the attempts made to decry the Magazine, have 
" been quite unworthy of naturalists, and, indeed, most un- 
" handsome ; witness an article in the paper which accom- 
" panics this, which was sent to me by an unknown hand. — 
" Probably you have seen the article before this ; 1 quite for- 
" get the particulars, and shall not peruse them agaiii" It is 
hardly necessary to state that this paper was a copy of the 
* Sheffield Iris ; ' and Mr. Bree being then a stranger to me, I 
felt sincerely his kindness in thus giving me the opportunity, 
had T thought it necessary, to satisfy him as to the fabricated 
nature of the statements which it contained. If I am blamed 
for not having, injustice to myself, come foiward with these 
details at the period when the circumstance ocicurred, 1 can 
only say, that I preferred the chance of incurring some share 
of personal injury, to the task of displaying, in connection 
with Natural History^ a picture of depravity so lamentable 
as the one now revealed ; and it is only the absolute necessity 
that exists for my clearing the ground as I advance, that has 
length compelled me to withdraw the veil from that which I 
would a thousand times rather should have remained in ob- 
scurity. 



In the Seventh volume of the first series of this journal, 
page 476, a critical notice is given of a book, entitled,— 
' Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri, extinct Monsters 
of the ancient Earth : ' by T. Hawkins, F.G.S. The author 
of this work had accumulated an extensive series of saurian 
remains from the lias of Somerset and Dorsetshire, and the 
collection thus formed was, in the year 1833, offered by its, 
possessor for sale to the British Museum; and after a consi- 



^ As the name of Mr. Maimd, the coiid actor of the ' Botanist' and '^ Bo- 
tanic Garden,' appeared originally on the wrapper of the ' Naturalist,' I am 
bound to state that I know of nothing whatever to implicate this gentle- 
man in any of the above proceedings. •

derable delay the purchase was ultimately effected for the 
sura of ,£1250. In 1835, a Parliamentary Committee was ap- 
pointed by the House, to enquire generally into the state and 
management of the British Museum, and among other matters 
of which they took cognizance, were the circumstances under 
which Mr. Hawkins's collection was bought ; more especially 
with reference to the minutes of certain steps taken by the 
Trustees, in consequence of a commimication made to them 
by Mr. Konig, as to the state of some portion of the collec- 
tion. I shall here make an extract from the Parliamentary 
Report. 

" The Rev. Josiah Forshall called in ; and examined. 

"2962. DO you produce auy papers wliich the Committee called for on 
a former day, with reference to Mr. Hawkins's collection? — The first paper 
I now produce, is a copy of a report made by Sir Henry Ellis, Mr. Konig, 
and Mr. Children, on the 2nd of February, 1829, regarding the department 
of Natural History. — {See Appendix, No. 27). — That paper does not relate 
at all to Mr. Hawkins's fossil remains. 

" The first paper I have in my custody regarding Mr. Hawkins's fossil 
remains, is a minute of the 11th of May, 1833, it merely states that an of- 
fer was made by Mr. Hawkins of a collection of fossil remains ; that a let- 
ter from Professor Buckland, on the subject of the collection, was laid 
before the Board ; and that the Trustees, being ignorant of the extent of 
the collection and the price at which it was estimated, declined the offer. 

"In the following month, June J 833, there is a second minute, that a 
letter was read from Mr. Thomas Hawkins, offering to the Trustees his 
collection of fossil organic remains for £4,000. ; Mr. Hawkins expressed 
his willingness to dispose of the best of the Saurian animals for £3,000. ; 
or should that offer prove unacceptable, with the rarest of them for £2,000.; 
a catalogue and drawings of the most remarkable specimens were laid be- 
fore the Trustees, and the Trustees declined the purchase." 

The next is simply a copy of a British-Museum minute. 

" (11.)— MINUTE of Committee, dated 1 August, 1834. 
" At a Committee, 

"A Letter, dated 12tli July, from Professor Buckland was read, stat- 
ing that he and Mr. Mantell had separately estimated every article in Mr. 
Hawkins's Fossil Sauri, and that they considered the remains figured in 
Mr. Hawkins's work to be worth £1,025.; and that the worth of the re- 
maining Sauri, not figured in the published plates, was £225. These last 
Professor Buckland and Dr. Mantell strongly recommended to be also ac- 
quired for the Museum. 

" This estimate was stated by Professor Buckland to be exclusive of the 
value of the cases in which some of the fossils are set; these last had been 
valued by Mr. William Caldecott and Mr. W. Bracher, two upholsterers 
and appraisers, at £60 5s. 

"The Secretary acquainted the Board, that as directed by the Minute 
of the last Committee, and under the sanction of several of the Trustees, 
to whom Professor Buckland's letter had been communicated, he had writ- 



APPENDIX. 13 

ten to the Lords of the Treasury, recommending the purchase to the con- 
sideration of their Lordships, 

" A letter, dated the 29th July, from the Treasury was read, stating that 
the Lords Commissioners concurred in opinion with the Trustees, that the 
opportunity should not be lost of acquiring possession of Mr. Hawkins's 
collection of fossil organic remains, to the great value of which such strong 
testimony is borne by most competent witnesses, and that their Lordships 
had directed an estimate for £1,310 5s. for the purchase of them to be laid 
before Parliament. 

" J. Forshall, Secretary. 
« British Museum, 22 July, 1835." 

Without considering it necessary to quote farther from the 
Parliamentary Report, I shall merely state that it appears from 
the rest of the British-Museum Minutes, that shortly after 
Mr. Hawkins's collection had been removed to the British 
Museum, a communication was made to the Trustees by the 
Principal of the Natural History department, Mr. Konig, res- 
pecting some modelled parts of the two largest specimens; — 
that in consequence of this communication an enquiry into the 
matter was instituted, but that the explanations afforded were 
deemed so far satisfactory, that the Trustees came to the de- 
termination "that it was unnecessary to enquire farther into 
the circumstances attending the purchase of Mr. Hawkins's 
collection." 

It so happened that during the treaty with the British Mu- 
seum for the sale of his fossils, Mr. Hawkins had taken me, 
in company with a third party, to inspect his collection ; 
and circumstances connected with this visit led me narrowly 
to look into the printed details of the Parliamentary investiga- 
tion. Now from this perusal 1 certainly received an unfa- 
vourable impression of the nature of the transaction, as it 
regarded the seller, but I had no wish to render that opi- 
nion notorious by any public expression of it, though I 
most assuredly conceived myself at liberty to discuss the mat- 
ter, under all ordinary circumstances, — a privilege which I 
presume, in common with myself, every one else w^ould claim, 
in respect to any other natioi^al purchase which may subse- 
quently have become a subject of Parliamentary investigation. 
In the latter part of 1838 I w^as dining at the house of an 
intimate friend, and a near relative of the late Dr. Thomas 
Young, whose name as a philosopher, ranks among the high- 
est that this country can boast of, when Mr. Hawkins's name 
was introduced (not by myself), and some questions put to 
me which elicited my opinion upon the affair with the British 
Museum. From circumstances which then transpired, I found 
that the parties who had volunteered the interrogatories were 



14 APPENDIX. 

personal friends of Mr. Hawkins's. Had a previous intimation 
been given nie of this, I should either have declined answering 
the questions altogether, or I should have so shaped my re- 
plies that no unfair advantage could be taken of what I said. 
From the tenour of what passed on the occasion, I was pre- 
l^ared to hear farther of the matter, and a short time afterwards 
I was written to, and invited to retract my opinion, or to state 
what I could in its justification ; the party writing to me being 
one of those who had in the first instance questioned me. In 
replying to this letter T had no suspicion that legal proceed- 
ings were in contemplation. I subsequently, however, under- 
stood, that Mr. Hawkins intended to move for a criminal 
information against me ; and shortly afterwards I received 
the following letter from Mr. Robert Young, sen., the father 
of the gentleman at whose house I was a guest, and one of 
the party present at the dinner-table when the conversation 
alluded to arose. 

No. 5. 

31 Deer. 1838, 

46, Nelson Square. 
Dear Sir, 

1 have excliang-ed a letter with Mr. Hawkins on the subject 
which has lately caused so much unhappy discussion heiween the parties 
concerned, and into which I need not now enter. Mr. H. has consented 
to suspend the matter for a week, but he requires terms on which I wish to 
have some conversation with you, and if you will breakfast with me here 
tomorrow morning at a quarter past 8, I think we shall be likely to ascer- 
tain what is to be done better than by writing. 

If you cannot come to breakfast, I will endeavour to call on you in 
the course of tomorrow ; three o'clock to half past would suit me, if you 
will say where. In the mean time I am. 

Yours faithfully, 

ROBT. YOUNG. 

That Mr. Young, sen., was actuated by the very best mo- 
tives in this attempt to bring about an aiTangement of the 
affair, there cannot be a doubt ; but he had received no au- 
thority from me to enter into negociations with Mr. Hawkins, 
and had he consulted me previously to his doing so, I should 
have told him that so far as I was concerned, no advances 
whatever should be made to arrest the course which Mr. 
Hawkins proposed to take. ^ No other result therefore arose 

^ There were no grounds on which Mr. Ilav/kins could have obtained a 
rule for a criminal information ; the only coarse open to him being that of 
a civil action.

from our interview, but that of Mr. Young deeming it expe- 
dient to send me copies of the correspondence which had 
passed between himself and Mr. Hawkins. From ihe letters 
of the latter I shall furnish a brief extract or two. The first 
bears date Dec. 29, 1839, and is written at Sharpham Park, 
near Glastonbury, Mr. Hawkins's place of residence. 

No. 6. 

" You must be aware, Sir, that a criminal action would cost him, [the 
Editor of the Mag. Nat Hist.] at least £500, for I should follow the ex- 
ample of the Duke of Cumberland, and subpoena every witness that ever 
had anything to do with ray transactions with the British Museum ; and 
also your son's dinner. 1 should degrade myself by an indulgence of any 
thing like revenge, but it is no less my duty to crush for ever a lie, which 
seems to have been carefully organized and perpetrated whenever an op- 
portunity could be found. This is the only object I have — to crush this 
lie for ever — it can be effected only by a public retraction, that is all I de- 
mand, and that I will, so help me God, obtain. You appeal to my lenity, 
I honour your feelings, and will defer instructions to my solicitor seven 
days from your receipt of this. If, within that time, this person writes an 

ample apology to , containing a no lesy ample disavowal 

of every offensive word he uttered against myself, and if I receive the said 
apology within the said time, there is an end of the matter. I need not 
add that until one week 1 shall neither say nor write one word on the sub- 
ject. I ^"so need not add that you are at liberty to communicate the en- 
tire contents of this letter to any one. I reiterate to any one. 

And remain, &c. &c.

In a subsequent epistle dated Jany. 4, 1839, Mr. Hawkins 
proceeds to enlighten Mr. Young in the following strain. —

« » » * I jjave therefore to repeat — and I do it with regret, in that 
I am not able to concede anything you ask of me — that I insist on a 
full, ample, and most satisfactory apology to , and as full a re- 
traction of anything against myself. Nothing one iota short of this shall 
prevent my bringing a criminal action, if I live, and there be one lawyer 
in England that will undertake it. 

" Considering that you will not receive this until Monday next, I shall 
concede this person the further grace of three days, that is to say till Thurs- 
day next. On the next Friday, if I do not meantime receive all I demand 
the case will be no longer in my hands, but those of my attorney. 

*' In the case of a criminal action I should subpoena and put upon oath 
every person at the dinner. They may be ready or unwilling witnesses, 
but it matters not. * * * I feel that I have conceded to your feelings 
and importunity too much, but I will abide by my word and wait till next 
Thursday's post, for that self-damning confession which I will move hea- 
ven and earth to have, if it be not spontaneously made.

16 APPENDIX. 

With a view of showing that Mr. Hawkins could adopt the 
language of the most cringing adulation, as well as that of the 
coarsest bullying, just as it chanced to suit his purpose, I here 
insert some passages from the correspondence between him- 
self and Dr. Buckland, written at the time during which the 
negociation with the British Museum for the purchase of the 
collection was pending. 

No. 8. 

" Clifford St., July 5tli, 1834. 
" I heg you to receive my sincere regards. This afternoon I have been 
told by the Kevd. vSecretary at the British Museum, that the Trustees ex- 
pressed much regret that the sum which my collection was confessedly 
worth, exceeded their ability, and that it would be most agreeable to them 
if Government would take up the question. You have obliged me already, 
and this emboldens me to solicit another favour at your hands. Would 

you give me a letter of introduction to the of , or any other 

high personage who may have influence with Her Majesty's Ministers? 
This, with a direct and energetic letter from yourself, would effect all that 
we can desire, — the preservation to the nation of my giant collection. I 
am aware that I take a great liberty, but I am also persuaded that you do 
feel some intellectual interest in the success of my design. This, with the 
assurance that I have of the ready attention with which the great flatter 
your wishes, induce me to place all my reliance upon you. 

The Rev. Prof. Buckland. 

No. 9. 

" Bloomsbury Square, May 13th, 1833. 

" Permit me to observe that I would you had yourself detemiined the 
money part as well as the rest of the question, although I must defer to 
the judicious — the delicate motive that induced you to decline doing so, — 
and to add that 1 have so arranged that portion of my collection purposed 
for the Museum, that you and Mr. Mantell could arrive at an estimate in 
one hour, which I am sure Mr. Mantell would spare for such an occasion. 
If any variation of opinion about price happen between you, let that di- 
fference be split, as the commercial world nervously calls it ; for how much 
debate and inconvenience, loss of time. Sec, the presence of a third party 
would occasion. In truth, my ark — my idol — is in your hands; you are 
its most efficient keeper, and to nominate another would be unnecessary, 
and as humiliating to me as two co-temporaneous high priests to the Jews. 
Besides, I shall from time to time make such additions, (perhaps by way 
of donation to the British Museum) to the collection, as will — am I rash ? 
— transmit my name with your's— the founder, the real founder of the col- 
lection there — to posterity. 

The Pvev. Prof. Buckland. 

Mr. Young sent me copies of the letters which he had re- 
ceived from Mr. Hawkins, under an idea that when I saw the 
warlike aspect^of his intentions I should be frightened, and feel 
the expediency of coming to terms with him if possible. The 
only effect however, produced, was that their perusal quite 



APPENDIX. 17 

satisfied me as to the correctness of my original opinion ; for 
had every thing been ' right ' in the British-Museum transac- 
tion, there would have been no occasion for all this display of 
thundering scurrility. Mr. Hawkins would have applied for 
a retraction, and upon its being refused, have quietly given 
his solicitor instructions to take such measures as, under the 
circumstances, he might deem expedient. In this position of 
affairs, conceiving that it might save the parties indirectly 
concerned in the matter, a great deal of unnecessary trouble 
and suspense, I determined to let Mr. Hawkins know the 
ground I was prepared to occupy, and accordingly I drew up 
and enclosed a letter to my solicitors, (Messrs. Richardson & 
Talbot, of Bedford Row), with a request that they, as my le- 
gal advisers, would forward a copy of it to Sharpham Park, in 
time for the Thursday's post. Its purport merely was to inform 
Mr. Hawkins, that his threats had been communicated to me ; 
that 1 would neither apologise to him for, nor retract the 
opinion I had expressed ; and that I had given my solicitors 
instructions to take all necessary steps for meeting whatever 
legal proceedings he thought proper to adopt. 

The call of the postman at Sharpham Park on the morning 
fixed for the arrival of the " self-damning confession," I ra- 
ther take it, placed Mr. Hawkins in a predicament that he 
was anything but prepared for. Never dreaming after he had 
passed safely through the ordeal of an investigation, by a select 
committee of the House of Commons, that I should venture 
to stand by my opinion, and test it before a judicial tribunal, 
he had pledged himself to Mr. Young, either to obtain a re- 
traction of the imputation w^hich had escaped my lips, or to 
institute a prosecution against me in a criminal court of jus- 
tice. His letter, containing an oath to that effect, was not 
ten days old ; and now there was staring him in the face, a 
rejoinder from my solicitors, accepting the challenge, in a 
tone that held out no chance of a loop-hole for evasion. 

Some time elapsed before Mr. Hawkins mustered even cou- 
rage to state his ground of action, but at length he lodged his 
declaration with my solicitors, laying the damages at a£lOOO. 
founding the proceedings upon the letter which I wrote to the 
party who questioned me at my friend's table. The decla- 
ration sets forth that Mr. Hawkins '^ had deservedly ob- 
" tained the good opinion and credit of all his neighbours ; 
" yet the defendant [Charlesworth'\ well knowing the pre- 
•' mises but greatly envying the happy state and condition of 
" the plaintiff [Hawkins] , and contriving and tvickedly in- 
" tending to injure him in his said good name, fame, and 
^^ credit, and to bring him into public scandal, infamy, and 



18 APPENDIX. 

" disgrace, and to vex, harass, and oppress, the plaintiff, on 
" the 22nd day of December, A.D. 1838, in the form of a let- 

" ter addressed to one , falsely and 

" maliciously did compose and publish, of and concerning the 
" plaintiff, a false, scandalous, malicious, and defamatory 
** libel, containing among other things the libellous matter 
^^ following ; * It appears by the published evidence of a Par- 
" ' liamentary Investigation'' (meaning thereby by two print- 
" ' ed and published reports from the Select Committee of the 
" ^ House of Commons on the British Museum, together with 
" 'Minutes of Evidence, <^(7." TJiat Mr. Hawkins (meaning 
''plaintiff.) * * ****** 

" * * * By means of the committing of which 
" said several grievances by the defendant, the plaintiff hath 
" been and is greatly injured in his good name, fame, and 
" credit, and brought into public scandal, infamy, and dis- 
" grace with and amongst all his neighbours, insomuch that 
" divers of those neighbours and subjects to whom the inno- 
" cence of the plaintiff in the said offences and misconduct 
" so as aforesaid mentioned to have been charged upon and 
" imputed to the plaintiff were unknown, have on occasion 
" of the committing of the said several grievances by the de- 
"fendant, from thence hitherto suspected and believed, and 
** still do suspect and believe, the plaintiff to have been guilty 
" of the offences and misconduct so as aforesaid, and have, 
" by reason of the committing of the said several grievances 
" as aforesaid by the defendant, from thence hitherto refused 
" and still do refuse their countenance and friendship to 
" plaintiff, and the plaintiff hath been and is by means of 
" the premises, otherwise greatly injured and damnified to 
" the damage of the plaintiff of £1000., and therefore he 
" brings his suit, &c." 

Now if I had ever seriously entertained the slightest wish to 
" vex, harass, and oppress " the author of the folio on the ex- 
tinct Saurians, I could have done so most effectually, without 
incurring the slightest personal risk, since there was nothing 
to prevent my bringing forward in the Magazine the subject 
of the Parliamentary inquiry, and there pointing out what ap- 
peared to me to be the weak points and inconsistencies in the 
published evidence. There were ample materials on which 
to exercise my ingenuity. So far from having written the 
letter, maliciously wdth the intention of injuring the plain- 
tiff, the original expression of my opinion was drawn from 
me, under the most confidential circumstances, — after 
which I was written to, and asked what I could advance in 
its justification ; and then the party so writing to me goes 



APPENDIX. 19 

direct with my answer to Mr. Hawkins, to enable him to bring 
an action upon the strength of its contents, and Mr. Hawkins 
himself is the person to go about and make known to his 
friends and neighbours, what had been said or written of him, 
and what he had " declared " he should do in consequence. 

It will readily be supposed that this trial would have been 
likely to excite some little interest in the Geological world; 
and it was not long in getting wind, that an inquiry into the 
circumstances attending the disposal to the British Museum, 
of Mr. Hawkins's fossil saurians, was to be brought forward 
in a legal shape. A gentleman, well known from his con- 
tributions to both the first and present series of this journal, 
passing through Oxford on his way to London, chanced to 
call on Dr. Buckland, and in the course of his visit, was 
somewhat startled at being informed by the Professor, that 
the Editor of the Magazine of Natural History was on '' the 
brink of ruin." Dr. Buckland, after explaining to him the 
state of the case, and learning that the party in question was 
personally known to me, exhorted him to use his best efforts 
to induce my falling in with Mr. Hawkins's proposal, it being 
understood between them, that he was at liberty to commu- 
nicate to me the Doctor's ideas upon the subject. Now it 
was a most unwarrantable assumption on the part of Dr. 
Buckland, to intimate to any third party, and especially to 
a naturalist contributing to the Magazine, that the Editor 
was on the brink of ruin, for no other reason than that an ac- 
tion was commenced against him, and the damages laid at 
a thousand pounds. He had no more foundation to justify 
his drawing that inference, than I should have had, if it had 
happened that Dr. Buckland had been the defendant in the 
cause instead of myself The gentleman above alluded to, on 
his reaching London, saw me upon the subject, and I am sure 
that he sincerely hoped to render me a service in so doing. — 
Merely therefore, expressing my con\dction of, and thanks for 
his friendly intentions, I shall pass on to a note received 
from Mr. Lyell. 



No. 10. 

Dear Sir, 

Happening to meet Dr. Buckland at dinner yesterday, I found 
him most willing to be a mediator, and indeed he had already taken some 
steps, though by no means aware the affair had proceeded so far. He will, 
I believe, expect you to give a verbal apology of some sort before the par- 
ties in whose company you used the expressions complained of, but as he 
said this in conversation, I cannot of course know precisely what he will 



20 APPENDIX. 

suggest. I know not where he is, probably at the Salopian coffee-house, 
but I believe Mr. Young knows. 

Yours truly, 

CHARLES LYELL. 

[No date affixed, but received February 17th, 1839]. 

It has been often said that there is but one step from the 
sublime to the ridiculous. Here we have Mr. Thomas Haw- 
kins, F.G.S., willing to forego the chance of his thousand 
pounds, — flinging to the winds all his solemn protestations, — 
and resorting to the pitiful expedient of getting Dr. Buckland 
to suggest that I should make "some sort of verbal apology." !!! 
Now I was very very far from courting the honour of break- 
ing a lance with this said Mr. Hawkins, in the Court of Com- 
mon Pleas, however grateful the neighbouring hotel-keepers 
might feel under the prospect of being intrusted with the care 
of half a hundred subpoenaed spectators ; but I was still less 
ambitious of calling in the aid of a go-between, to mediate 
betwixt me and the Glastonbury champion. For this and 
other equally cogent reasons, I declined, in as courteous a 
manner as I could, a proposal originating with Dr. Buckland, 
that I should have an interview with him to talk over the 
matter. 

The next communication I received, was from a gentleman 
towards whom I have reason for entertaining the highest feel- 
ings of respectful regard, — the Rev. J. Forshall, the Secretary 
of the British Museum. 

No. 11. 
Dear Charlesworth, 

Dr. Buckland has called upon me in reference to some 
dispute between you and M. T. Hawkins. Dr. Buckland seems to think 
that you are ignorant of the facts of the case, and that I may possibly be 
able to explain them to you. 

Have you any objection to come and see me ? 

Yours very truly, 
British Museum, J. FORSHALL. 

18th Feb. 1839. 

I most readily complied with Mr. Forshall's proposal, but 
the only result was his writing to Dr. Buckland, to inform him 
of the unsuccessful nature of the interview which followed. 

I presumed that the idea of frightening me into the admis- 
sion that I did not mean what I said, was now abandoned as 
hopeless. Five or six weeks had passed, and neither the heavens 
nor the earth exhibiting any extraordinary acceleration of their 
movements, I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Hawkins 
had had a change come ^'^ o'er the spirit of his dream,'"' when 



APPENDIX. 21 

the same gentleman who was entrusted with the commission 
from Oxford, saw me again, and informed me that as I had 
persisted in maintaining my original opinion, Dr. Buckland 
now intended to make himself a party to the action, and not 
to suffer Mr. Hawkins to let it drop ; and that in the presence 
of my informant and other parties, he had positively declared 
his intention to this effect, the previous night, at the rooms of 
the Geological Society. That this declaration ofDr.Buckland's 
was specially meant for my ears, I have not a doubt, though 
it was brought to me under a real apprehension that if I did 
not think better of my determination, the united forces of Mr. 
Hawkins and the Professor would be more than a match for 
me, and that I should inevitably be crushed. The composure 
with which I received the news of the powerful ally who had 
enlisted against me under Mr. Hawkins's banner, appeared, I 
dare say, highly philosophical to the bearer of the tidings. — 
The simple truth was, however, that I felt quite satisfied that 
Dr. Buckland had no intention of carrying his declaration 
into effect, because had he seriously contemplated a step of 
that description, he would have had the shrewdness to have 
kept it to himself That this guess of mine was not a great 
way off the truth, was not long after confirmed in a manner 
that I little expected, by the following document falling in 
my way. It matters not who was the writer of this, — nor to 
whom it was addressed, — nor how it came into my hands, — 
its genuineness will not be called into question, or should it 
be, all particulars can be readily furnished. 

No. 12. 

" On Friday I went over to see Hawkins, and I found tliat the affair is 
suspended for some time. In fact I think that the delay is tantamount to 
bringing no action at all. Suspended, he tells me, until the Chanc. Exch. 
has given him an answer relative to his large collection, all the particulars 
of which must come before Parliament, before they grant the money for the 
purchase, and we know how long these affairs hang about before they get 
settled." * * * "It moreover appears that Buckland wrote to Haw- 
kins a letter, advising him, from what I could collect, not to proceed ; this 
letter he placed in Satchell's [plaintiff's attorney] hands, and left him, 
he tells me, to his own choice, as to continuing the action or not; so that 
altogether the thing will, I think, drop." 

It only wanted this to make the farce perfect ; — Mr. Haw- 
kins, exulting in the certainty of my being fast in his clutches, 
offers me, in the plenitude of his benevolence, seven days' 
grace, to transmit him by letter a " self-damning confession" 
for the columns of the Times newspaper, or the alternative of 
my immediately becoming the subject of a criminal informa- 



22 APPENDIX. 

tion. I defy his threats, and in a few weeks I receive a com- 
munication from Mr. Lyell, by which I am given to under- 
stand that Dr. Buckland undertakes to arrange the matter, 
upon my making some sort of verbal apology. I reject the 
overture, and the next thing I learn is, that there lies in Mr. 
Hawkins's solicitor's hands a letter written by Dr. Buckland, 
advising that the action be dropped altogether. It is hardly 
necessary to add, that upon the perusal of the above document, 
the materials I had collected for the purpose of substantiating 
my opinion were laid upon the shelf, where they have ever 
since quietly reposed. 

Before quitting this subject, I must remark, that the inter- 
ference of the distinguished Geological Professor at the Ox- 
ford University, in the transaction above detailed, has alone 
involved the necessity for the appearance of so much of this 
Appendix as relates to the case of ^Hawkins versus Charles- 
worth.' The part which he has taken upon himself, has giv- 
en an air of importance to that, which I might otherwise have 
regarded as a mere piece of chicanery, aiming under a threat 
of legal proceedings, at a particular purpose, and about the 
ultimate consequences of which a moment's consideration 
would be thrown away. Dr. Buckland, hearing of the cir- 
cumstances, w^as of course at liberty to enter into communi- 
cation upon the subject with Mr. Hawkins, and if he felt so 
disposed, to supply him with the resources for carrying on 
the action. The step taken by the Professor wherein I con- 
ceive he has laid himself open to animadversion, was the as- 
suming certain consequences towards myself, as the defend- 
ant in the action, and the conveying to me the nature of that 
assumption through the agency of other parties. If Dr. Buck- 
land thought I stood in need of his counsel, the direct and 
only legitimate course for him to follow, was that of commu- 
nicating with me in person or by letter ; in which case, either 
as the President of a scientific body to which I have the ho- 
nour to belong, or upon the strength of occasional intercourse 
which had previously arisen between us, he could, without 
in any way committing himself, have tendered me such ad- 
vice as he might consider the occasion to warrant. I do not 
say that the object he had in view^ was illegitimate, but I com- 
plain of the machinery put in motion, by which it was hoped 
that object might be secured. 

The sounding the alarm-bell in so many quarters has been 
followed, as a natural consequence, by the question being 
put, why have not Professor Buckland's anticipations been 
realized, and what has been the nature of the compromise ? 
There is no occasion for me to hint at the manner in which 



APPENDIX. '28 

this most awkward interrogation has been responded to, but 
so far as it may lie in my power, I must guard against its 
going forth to that circle in which the journal under my 
direction is supported, that at present I owe anything to the 
intercesfiion of Dr. Buckland, or to the clemency of his pro- 
tege, Mr. Thomas Haw^kins. I have been let alone, because 
the entrapping a person into the unguarded expression of an 
opinion, happily does not involve the condition of the sen- 
timent conveyed by that expression having been unguardedly 
arrived at ; and because my pseudo-antagonist, upon being 
foiled in his calculations, was much too wide aw^ake to bum 
his fingers any farther. 

The commencement of proceedings against me in another 
quarter, of a tendency far more to be dreaded than any mea- 
sures of a legal description, and upon the consideration of 
which T have next to enter, has left me no alternative but that 
of coming forw^ard and openly showing that I have not been 
the party to fight shy of this contest ; but that hitherto, so far 
as it has proceeded, I have met in a straightforward and un- 
compromising manner, the disgraceful litigation with w^hich I 
have been threatened. If by reason of this publication, 
and after the interval of time which has now elapsed, Mr. 
Hawkins .should be so ill-advised as to go before a jury, in 
the hope of getting a farthing damages, for a pretended in- 
jury w^hicli he himself had most assuredly a hand in bring- 
ing about, it will be found that instead of simply pleading 
7iot guilty to the assumed libel, I have placed a justification 
on record. Having done this, unless the question shall come 
to a legal decision, and unless it shall then be satisfactorily 
shown that there were no grounds for the belief which I 
have been led to entertain, I occupy, in relation to the whole 
affair, let its merits be what they may, a position, which 
ought in common justice to protect me from even the whisper 
of an injurious imputation. ^ 



Since the appearance of the first 2*2 pages of this appendix 
(a period of two months having now elapsed) I have received 

' I avail myself of tliis opportunity to acknowledge the warm interest 
which from the first commencement of the proceedings, has been taken in 
the case by my solicitor, Mr. Richardson, a Fellow of the Geological So- 
ciety, and a valued correspondent of the Magazine of Natural History. 
Immediately upon the issue of the writ, he sent to secure for me the ser- 
vices of Mr. Sergeant Wilde, but that eminent member of the bar had al- 
ready been retained by the opposite party. 



'24 APPENDIX. 

but one communication disputing the accuracy of any state- 
ment which I have put forward ; and as in this instance the 
writer wishes me to con-ect the misrepresentation of which he 
complains, I cannot adopt a fairer course than to make that 
coiTcction in his own words. In so doing I think it as well 
to remark, that before the publication of the appendix I held 
no communication respecting it with any one of the parties 
therein alluded to. I felt satisfied that I could furnish a 
faithful relation of such circumstances in the liistory, as in- 
volved a question of memory, and I therefore preferred to 
risk the chance of the acciu'acy of any part of my statement 
being subsequently impugned, rather than to expose myself 
to the being placed in the position of having to bring forward 
details under a protest against their publication ; a position 
which would have been in the highest degTee painful, if, as in 
the present instance, such a protest had come to me from a 
party whose share in the transaction had been irreproachable, 
and altogether accidental. 

The letter is from the gentleman of whom I have spoken 
as having been the bearer of certain opinions or intentions 
expressed by Dr. Buckland, in relation to the action com- 
menced against me by Mr. Thomas Hawkins. 

No. 13. 

" Your statement of the interview at the Geological Society, in page 21 
** of your Appendix, is calculated to give an erroneous impression of what 
" took place ; for though the Doctor certainly did say, in an ofF-hand man- 
" ner, " OA, if Hawkins won't prosecute, I wiU,^^ or words to that effect, yet 
•* his manner of saying it did not convey to my mind anything like a deli- 
*' berate intention of doing so, hut it seemed merely expressive of his indig- 
*' nation at the charge brought against Hawkins, and his conviction of its 
" want of foundation. I never therefore meant you to understand that 
•' ' Dr. Buckland now intended to make himself a party to the action,' or 
** that * he had positively declared his intention to this effect ;' and I shall 
" be obliged if you will correct this misrepresentation in your next No." 

From the confidence which is supposed to reign among 
the guests, at a private dinner-table, one of the party may 
think himself hardly dealt with, if the opinions, which on such 
an occasion he unguardedly expresses, are afterwards arrayed 
in judgment against him before the bar of a judicial tribunal ; 
but at a public conversazione, such as those which take place 
after the evening meetings of the Geological Society, we do 
not expect ' off-hand' speeches to be made by the President, 
when the subject under discussion happens to be of so serious 
a character as an action for libel, relating to evidence pub- 
lished bv a select committee of the House of Commons. 



APPENDIX. 25 

However sensible I may feel of the unjustifiable nature of the 
weapons which have been turned against myself, I think it 
will be seen, when this Appendix shall have been brought to 
a conclusion, that I have, in no instance, been forced to make 
good my own story, by affixing a construction to words, either 
spoken or written, which they were not intended to convey. 
Had I upon the occasion referred to, been given to understand 
that Dr. Buckland's was an off-hand speech, I certainly 
would not have opposed it to the contents of the document, 
No. 12, with which, at present, it so unhappily clashes. As 
it respects that document, by which it seems that a letter of 
Dr. Buckland's, advising the abandoning the action, was lying 
in the hands of the solicitors for the prosecution, (Messrs. 
Stevens, Wilkinson and Satchell, of Queen Street, Cheapside), 
it fell into my hands without the knowledge of the writer. 
Circumstances however, which it is unnecessary to mention, 
made me feel justified in making the use I did of it. Now 
without enquiring as to whether or not it would have been a 
feather in the cap of the President of the Geological Society, 
to have aided and abetted Mr. Hawkins in prosecuting the 
Editor of a scientific journal, the said journal having for its 
sole object the promotion of Natural History, and the 
said prosecution, according to Dr. Buckland's account, in- 
volving the ruin of the party about to be prosecuted, — every 
one I am sure must feel how desirable it would be for the re- 
putation of the Doctor, that he should not appear to have 
written one thing and spoken another. If what Mr. Haw- 
kins stated to the writer of the document No. 12, was correct, 
(as there seems every reason to suppose it was) and Dr. Buck- 
land had advised him to drop the action, I conceive it to be 
in that case, a moral impossibility for Dr. Buckland to have 
pretended to entertain the intention which he did, without 
being fully conscious that he was uttering a threat, diametri- 
cally opposed to his real sentiments. When Mr. in 

apologising for this speech, refers it to Dr. Buckland's indig- 
nation at the chai'ge brought against Mr. Hawkins, he surely 
forgets that it was not I who charged Mr. Hawkins with unfair 
conduct in the British-Museum affair. It was the Trustees 
of that establishment themselves, and subsequently a select 
committee of the House of Commons, who brought the matter 
forward : all that I did was to express a belief in the charges 
so brought being coiTectly founded, the evidence which led 
me to entertain that belief, being before the public in a printed 
form. 

Dr. Buckland sent me, through my friend Mr. Thomas 
Young, an invitation to breakfast with him on the 18th of 



26 APPENDIX. 

February 1839, that being the day on which I subsequently 
received from the Rev. Mr. Forshall the communication No. 
11. In reply to this invitation I sent the following note : — 

No. 14. 

Dear Sir, 

My friend, Mr. Thomas Young, tells me that in consequence 
of his calling to consult you respecting certain legal proceedings pending 
against myself for words spoken at his dinner-table, that you have proposed 
we should both breakfast with you to-morrow.' In reluctantly declining 
your invitation, I trust that you will not impute my so doing to any disin- 
clination to effect an amicable arrangement of the matter in dispute, but 
as I suppose you will be one of the witnesses opposed to me on the trial, I 
do not think it would be expedient for me to enter upon a discussion of the 
subject with you previously to the action coming on. 
I remain dear Sir, 

Yours very faithfully, 

EDWARD CHARLESWORTH. 
Rev. Dr. Buckland. 

Between the dates of my receiving this invitation to be a 
guest at Dr. Buckland's breakfast-table, and the Doctor's de- 
claration that he would be my prosecutor if Mr. Hawkins would 
not, I had committed no crime except that of declining to 
compromise the action, by retracting an opinion which I could 
only retract at the expense of a violation of moral principle. 

When I commenced this Appendix, as the action, though 
virtually, was not legally abandoned, I had resolved not to 
advance anything which might be construed into an attempt 
to prejudice my adversary's cause; but a reconsideration of 
the whole subject, has induced me to change this determi- 
nation. As the case now stands, it weai's an aspect which 
is, perhaps, hardly just to all the parties concerned, and I 
therefore think it the better course, to remove at once the 
mystery which hangs over the affair, by frankly stating some 
of the reasons which have led me to form a conclusion so 
essentially at variance with the spirit of the resolution en- 
tered on the minutes of the British Museum, by the Honor- 
able Board of Trustees. Had I done this immediately upon 
my being served with the writ, and before the time arrived 
for my prosecutor to lay his case before a Jury, this step 
might, perhaps, have afforded Mr. Hawkins some reasonable 
ground of complaint ; but after the annoyance to which I have 
been subjected, and as twelve months have gone by since the 

' Dr. Buckland's interference did not originate with this call of Mr. 
Young's, but some time previously to it.

first commencement of proceedings against me, I think now 
I need entertain no scruples on the score of delicacy to the 
feelings of my opponent. But in thus going farther than 1 
originally proposed, I must again remind the readers of this 
Appendix, that the placing this history before them involves no 
act of aggression on my part. The measure throughout is solely 
one of self protection. I find myself in a position, which 
no exercise of prudence or fore -sight could possibly have 
guarded me against ; one into which T have been forced by the 
treachery of parties, who stand the foremost in the ranks of 
those who are at work in the field of philosophical research. If 
this position bring with it the necessity for my explaining the 
relation in which I have been placed to the President of the 
Geological Society, and that explanation be injurious 
either to him or to Mr. Hawkins, 1 have this to urge in its 
justification. — 

That an assumed case of unfair dealing, in a purchase made 
by the British Museum of some objects in Natural History, 
having been investigated by a Committee of the House of 
Commons, and the evidence relating thereunto published in 
the usual manner, the opinions expressed in relation to that 
investigation, must either be favourable or unfavourable to- 
wards the party suspected of the fraud. — That having been 
led, in private conversation, to state my own opinion to be 
on the unfavourable side, the commencing an action against 
me under the idea that I would retract that opinion, rather 
than subject myself to a harassing and expensive prosecution, 
was an act of tyranny, which, if legally^ was not morally^ 
justifiable, and which I believe to be without precedent, in 
the history of even the law of libel. 

Imagine for a moment the question divested of the fearful 
array of technicalities and legal quibbles, which, like a swarm 
of evil sprites, hover round the head of the victim entangled 
in the meshes of the code of libel, and nothing can be more 
simple than the data required to set at rest the matter in 
dispute. 

Mr. Hawkins sells to the Trustees of the British Museum 
the fossil skeleton of a reptile, for 200 guineas ; the Trustees 
having resolved upon its purchase, in consequence of the 
strong recommendation of many naturalists of eminence, and 
after they (the Trustees) have had a lithographic drawing of 
the specimen in question put before them. Subsequently to 
the purchase being effected, and the fossil deposited in the 
national collection, certain portions represented as genuine 
in the lithograph, are found to be fictitious. Now it is unre- 
servedly admitted, that no intimation of the real condition 




28 APPENDIX. 

of the fossil remain was given to the Trustees as the purcha- 
sers, or to the officer at the head of the Natural- History de- 
partment, Mr. Konig ; and this being the case, the whole 
thing hinges upon whether there was or was not a full and 
explicit understanding between the seller and the valuers, 
as to the precise extent of the manufactured parts ; and the 
affinnative of that proposition being assumed, whether or not 
the purchasers ought to have been informed that the litho- 
graphic print submitted to their inspection, was not an honest 
representation of the original. 

Waiving for the present the discussion upon the two-hun- 
dred-guinea specimen, [ will commence by referring to page 
438, vol. 2 of the Parliamentary Report, where I find the fol- 
lowing British Museum Minute.

" A Letter, dated July 9th, was read from Mr. Thomas Hawkins, offer- 
ing to the Trustees his collection of fossil remains of Ichthyosauri and 
Plesiosauri, for any sum of money at which they might be valued by Pro- 
fessor Buckland of Oxford ; Mr. Hawkins stated that this offer included 
all the articles engraved in his published work on these fossils." 

The next documents bearing upon the subject, which 1 se-

LETTER from the Rev. Dr. Buckland to the Trustess of the British 
Museum. 

London, 12 July, 1834. 
My Lords and Gentlemen, 

I have this day carefully looked over the collection of the 
remains of Sauri offered for sale to the British Museum by Mr. Hawkins, 
and have had the valuable assistance of Mr. Mantell, in estimating every 
article separately. After carefully revising our notes, taken on separate 
lists, without communication with one another, we found our estimates of 
the whole to coincide within 5/. ; they are as below : 

All the specimens engraved in Mr. Hawkins's publication (substituting 
a large Plesiosaurus, now in Adelaide-street, for plate 4, the subject of 
which has been sold), we value at 1,025/. The remainder of his collection 
of Sauri, not published in his work, but which we also strongly recommend 
to be purchased for the Museum, we value at 225/. Total value, 1 , 250/. 
In this estimate we do not include the cases of wood in which some of 
the specimens are framed ; these are to be paid for by the Trustees, at a 
separate valuation to be made by two persons, one of whom is to be ap- 
pointed by the Trustees, and the other by Mr. Hawkins ; with reference to 
their umpire, in case of a diflerencc of opinion as to the value. 

I have the honour, <Scc., 
(Signed) WM. BUCKLAND. 




APPENDIX. 29 



Tlie al)i)vc information lias tliis clay been communicated to Mr. Hawkins 
under the joint signatures of Mr. Mantell and myself. 

No. 17. 

The Rev. Prof. Buckland, to Thos. Hawkins, Esq. 

Salopian Coffee House, 12th July, 1834. 
I beg to return your catalogue, and with it enclose the amount 
of the valuation by Mr. Mantell and myself of your entire (the Editor)* 
collection of Remains of Sauri. I have sent a duplicate of this valuation 
to the Trustees of the British Museum, inclosed to the Secretary, the Rev. 
J. Forshall, and through whom your future communications with the 
Trustees will have to pass. 

I expect a Committee of the Trustees will make application to the 
Treasury as soon as a new Government is formed ; till then you will pro- 
bably hear no further of the matter. 

I have much satisfaction in telling you that when Mr. Mantell and my- 
self compared our separate valuations of the collections engraved in your 
book, and also of those included in your addition to them, our estimates of 
the total valuation of each did not differ ten pounds, and that the balance 
of the difference was given entirely in your favour. 

I trust by the time I come again to London to find the Sauri all lodged 
safely in the magnificent gallery of the Museum, which is so worthy to 
receive them. 

I now pass on to a portion of the evidence given by Mr. 
Konig in his examination before the Committee. 

No. 18. 

Charles Ko7iig, Esq. called in and examined. 

When Was it first discovered that some of these fossil skeletons were 
artificial, and not entirely genuine ? — I discovered it when the large spe- 
cimen was put up, after the case was finished. I had no opportunity to 
examine it sooner. 

Had you been consulted, should you have thought it your duty to make 
a close examination before purchasing? — Certainly. 

Do you know whether Dr. Buckland and Mr. Mantell ascertained that 
part was artificial? — Dr. Buckland has said he knew it was artificial to a 
great extent. Had I been present, if Dr. Buckland had told me the spe- 
cimen was not genuine, I should have considered it my duty to have ex- 
amined more closely into it; but if Dr. Buckland and Mr. Mantell had 
said, "all this is genuine," I should perhaps, in deference to their superior 
knowledge, have given way, and fallen into what I consider the same mis- 
take. 

You do not mean by that to imply anything affecting the moral charac- 
ter of Mr. Hawkins the vender, or Dr. Buckland and Mr. Mantell, the 
parties on whose recommendation the purchase was made, the Trustees as 
the purchasers, or any of the officers of the Museum? — Certainly not. 
It could only effect the character of the person who made the reparation, 
if he had endeavoured to conceal the restoration. If I had been told the 
specimen was genuine, I might myself have given credit to the assertion. 

* What do the words " the Editor" mean here ? — E. C. 



:)0 APPENDIX. 

After tlio circunistiiiUH' becaine known, did you make any report to the 
Trustees!' — 1 first wrote to Dr. Bucklaud and Mr. Mantell, informing 
them of tlie discovery I had made. I have a copy of that letter, which I 
can produce ; and I afterwards thought it my duty to report the fact to 
the Trustees, and that report is also in existence. 

Can you produce a copy of that report? — I have no copy, but the report 
itself can be produced. 

What was the date of that report ? — I cannot charge my memory. 

Have you had opportunities of examining large collections of Saurian 
remains from the lias formation ? — I have seen most of the large collec- 
tions. 

You are aware that it is a very tender and friable formation in which 
the bones are found ? — Yes. 

Do you think, h'om the opportunity you Imve had of examining other 
collections, that the specimens of Mr. Hawkins are restored in a greater 
degree than is generally the case ? — That is my impression. 

In selling such articles, is it not usual and fair to specify the artificial 
reparations that have been made ? — I should have done so. 

Were these specimens sold to the Museum as perfect specimens of Sau- 
rian remains ? — I do not know ; I have not seen the report. 

You received them as perfect remains ? — I received them merely as re- 
mains. 

Had you any reason to believe, when you received them, and previous to 
your examination, that any portion was artificial ? — I never gave it a 
thought. As soon as I examined them I was sure of it ; but not till then. 
Restorations were acknowledged by Mr. Hawkins in his publication, such 
as the restoration of the right paddle. 

Were the whole of the restorations marked in the plate you have alluded 
to ?— No. 

In that plate was the tail of the specimen introduced ? — No. When I 
began to compare the specimens with the plates, I found the Ichthyosaurus 
plate 4, was wanting, which is one of the most interesting specimens, hav- 
ing the scapulce in their proper situation. I was alarmed at it, and wrote 
to Mr. Forshall, who informed me the specimen had been sold by Mr. 
Hawkins ; but another had been substituted, and that specimen turned out 
to be the worst of all in point of restoration. 

What authority have you for stating that? — The specimen was sold be- 
fore the purchase by the Museum was made. Had the price been less, 
this would not much signify. 

At page 443 of the Report, there is a copy of another Bri- 
tish-Museum Minute, in which an allusion is made by Mr. 
Konig to the specimen substituted by the valuers in the 
place of plate 4 ; and a portion of which Minute I here ex- 
tract. 

No. 19. 

MINUTE of Committee, dated Htli March, 1835. 

At a Committee : 

Mr. Konig gave it as his opinion, that the colouring of the re- 
stored parts of Mr. Hawkins's large Ichthj/osaurus, so as to distinguish them 



API>ENDIX. 31 

from those wliicli are really osseous, would be preferable to a complete abra- 
sure of the plaster of Paris. 

The Trustees directed that this method should be adopted with regard 
to all the restored parts of Mr. Hawkins's specimens. 

Mr. Konig suggested that the vacant space in the case, above and below 
the tail of this large specimen, might be filled up by the introduction of 
two other framed specimens from the same collection. He likewise sug- 
gested that another specimen, 14 feet in length, which was made up, and 
entirely worthless, should be excluded from the gallery. 



The above extracts from the Parliamentary Report, put us 
in possession of the following facts. That on the 9th of 
July, 1834, Mr. Hawkins wrote to the Trustees of the British 
Museum, making them a tender of his collection, and stating 
in the letter that his offer included all the saurians figured in 
his work. That on the 12th of the same month (only three 
days after the date of this offer), the Trustees appoint two 
parties (Drs. Buckland and Mantell) to value the collection. 
That the valuers, in making their estimate, find that the sub- 
ject of plate 4 in Mr. Hawkins's work, had been sold, but 
they substitute for the missing specimen, a large unfigured 
Plesiosaurus. This is followed by the evidence of the officer 
at the head of the Natural-History department, Mr. Konig, 
who discovers that the Plesiosaurus so substituted, is made up 
of plaster of Paris, to such an extent as to justify his recom- 
mending to the Trustees that it be excluded from the gallery 
as " utterly worthless ;" while on the other hand, he informs 
the Parliamentary Committee that the missing specimen ap- 
pears by the engraving to have been one of the 7nost inte- 
resting in the whole collection. 

Now it is quite clear from this, that Mr. Hawkins stated 
that which was untrue, in his letter to the Trustees of July 
9th, 1834, or else that within three days after sending in that 
letter, and before the valuation could i3e effected, he privately 
sold the subject of one of his plates. The history of this 
specimen, in connection with the evidence given as to the 
real state of the one which the valuers took as an equivalent 
for it, has always appeared to me the most criminatory fea- 
ture in the whole transaction. Nor have I any reason to 
believe that in the archives of the British Museum, there will 
be found any unpublished document which shall modify the 
tenour of this part of the evidence. 

But even if there be such a document, I am prosecuted for 
an opinion founded upon certain evidence which appears in 
a published Parliamentary Report, and upon that evidence 
alone I presume a verdict must be obtained against me. I 
take it for granted that Dr. Buckland, when upon his oath 



32 APPENDIX. 

in the witness-box, will swear that he was privy to the condi- 
tion of the specimen described by Mr. Konig as *' utterly worth- 
less," but how then will he acquit himself upon a cross-exami- 
nation as to the wording of the valuation, drawn up by him- 
self and Dr. Mantell ? Fortunately for me, the critical con- 
struction of language does not constitute an element for the 
consideration of the jury. In determining upon their verdict, 
they are directed to receive words, whether relating to the 
libel itself, or to the evidence by which the libel is defended, 
in their ordinary acceptation. Now, the valuers tell the 
Trustees, that in drawing up their estimate, they substitute a 
large unjigured Plesiosaurus for a figured one which Mr. 
Mr. Hawkins had sold. Unless they meant it to be under- 
stood that the one substituted was equivalent to the one 
which was missing, what possible reason could they have for 
so wording their valuation ? 

Upon referring to the British-Museum Minute of the 12th 
of July 1834, I find a passage which bears in a very important 
manner upon this part of the e\ddence. It is as follows : 

No. 20. 

" The Trustees requested Dr. Buckland to send the valuation which he 
and Mr. Mantell might put upon these organic remains, to the Secretary 
so soon as it was made, and to distinguish in their valuation, the part of 
which engravings are given in Mr. Hawkins's work, from the other Sau- 
rian remains." 

Dr. Buckland receives from the Trustees explicit directions 
to put, conjointly with Dr. Mantell, one price upon the en- 
graved Saurians, and another upon those not engraved. When 
therefore, the valuers found the series of figured Saurians 
deficient, the plain course for them to follow was to word their 
estimate thus : — 

All the Saurian remains engraved in Mr. Hawkins's work, minus the 

subject of plate 4, which has been sold, we value at . All the Saurian 

remains in Mr. Hawkins's collection which are not engraved in his work, 
we value at . Total value £1250. 

Now if Dr. Buckland, when in the witness-box, states that 
he did know the substituted Plesiosaurus to be comparatively 
worthless, from its being in part plaster of Paris, and that he 
did not mean, in taking it from the series of unfigured ones and 
classing it with those which were figured, that the word * sub- 
stitute'' was to imply ' in lieu of,' he must then explain not 
onlv Mhv he worded his valuation in a manner altogether ir- 



APPENDIX.

regular, but why he went directly counter to the directions 
given him by the Trustees. 

If words are to be used in their every-day acceptation, the 
premises will not admit of any other conclusion, than that the 
Trustees were to understand the substituted Plesiosaurus 
equivalent to the one which had been previously disposed of. 
Dr. Buckland, on the part of Mr. Hawkins, makes no at- 
tempt to explain this matter of " substitution," and this being 
the case, I cannot admit the apology which has been offered 
for the speech at the evening conversazione at the Geological 
Society. The doctor must have been perfectly conscious, that 
any one who took the pains to scrutinize the published evi- 
dence, could not do otherwise than form an unfavourable im- 
pression of the nature of the transaction ; and consequently, 
his threat to back Mr. Hawkins in the prosecution, could not 
be intended merely to convey an expression of his indigna- 
tion at the opinion I had formed. I am disposed to think Dr. 
Buckland knew that in all probability this warlike declaration 
would be conveyed to me, and following in the steps of liis 
friend at Sharpham Park, he tried the experiment of making 
a parade of his intentions, little suspecting his protege would 
be so destitute of worldly wisdom as to betray the singularly 
original method adopted by his patron in carrying those in- 
tentions into effect. 

Before I proceed to the letter of Dr. Buckland, in which 
he assures the Secretary of the British Museum that he knew 
the full extent of the fabricated parts, at the time of the 
valuation being made, I shall quote from the Report one or 
two passages which refer to the deceptive effect produced 
by means of the plaster of Paris, and to the unreasonableness 
of the sum which the public have paid for the collection. 

Mr. James de Carle Sowerby, who, from the relation in 
which he stands to English Geologists, certainly may be 
supposed willing to say as much as he honestly could, in 
favour of Dr. Buckland's valuation, gives the following evi- 
dence.^ 

No. 21. 

" Are you acquainted at all with those fossils in the Museum, which are 
called Hawkins's fossils ? — Yes, I have seeu them several times ; I did 
know some little of them hefore they came to the Museum. 



' " I have been induced to give up my time towards forwarding the im- 
mediate objects of the leading geologists of England, by yielding them the 
best assistance my humble talent would permit." (Mr. Sowerby, ' Mag. 
Nat. Hist.,' vol. 3, new series, p. 419.) 



34 APPENDIX. 

Are you prepared to give any opinion upon their value ? — It always 
appeared to me that above £1000 was a very high price for them, because 
a similar specimen or specimens, not very far inferior to the best of them, 
have been sold for 100 or 120 guineas. 

Are you aware that some portions of those specimens have been disco- 
vered to be artificial ? — I was aware of that before they came to the Mu- 
seum, that a considerable portion was manufactured in plaster. It cer- 
tainly required some skill to do that, but I do not think it enhances the 
real value of the things. 

Were those parts that were manufactured so skilfully done as to deceive 
the eye, and apparently with the intention to deceive ? — I cannot speak as 
to the intention, the effect was to deceive the eye. I certainly was deceived 
by them when I saw some of them in the Adelaide Gallery." 

The following extract will show the opinion of Mr. Konig, 
the officer to whose care the Geological depaitment of the 
Museum is especially entrusted. 

No. 22. 

" After full examination of the remains, do yon think that the collection 
is worth £1 ,250 ? — It is a matter of opinion. My opinion was, that it was 
ratlier too much, and that is the opinion of some other gentlemen of my 
acquaintance ; but I never stated that publicly ; I had no reason to do it. 

Can you favour the Committee with a statement of your opinion as to 
the sum which you believe the Trustees could now obtain for this collec- 
tion if they were inclined or enabled to dispose of the same ? — I am per- 
fectly unable to do that ; and I suppose nobody can do so. 

Did you believe that the sum of £500 had been asked and given [by the 
Museum] for one of the specimens? — I certainly stated that. 

If you then believed that the sum of £500 had been asked and given 
for one of the specimens, do you conceive that the sum of £1,250 was out 
of proportion to the assumed value of the general collection in its entirety ? 
— I should not acquiesce in the reasonableness of £500 for that specimen, 
but I may be mistaken. 

When you were called upon to see the collection, had you any reason to 
suspect that any part of it was artificially composed ?¦ — When I saw it, it 
was at a distance. The coach-house where it was kept was full of this 
collection, and other things with it ; and it was impossible to go quite 
near it. But even had I ioeen so close to it as to be able to examine into 
the genuineness of the specimen, it would never have occurred to me. I 
did not go for that purpose. 

Have you seen the plates of the great specimens of the Ichthyosauri, 
which were published before the specimens themselves were purchased by 
the Trustees of the British Museum ? — I have seen them; but I did not 
examine them or read the book at all. 

Will you examine the plate of the large specimen alluded to, and point 
out to the Committee such parts of it as that plate indicates to be artificial 
in the real specimen {the Plate being shoivn to the Witness) ? — In this plate 
the right fore paddle is represented as a restoration. 

The right paddle not being shaded, but simply engraved in outline, indi- 
cates that that part is not real in the specimen purchased ? — Yes. 

Now, in the specimen actually purchased, are there not some parts arti- 
ficial, which in this drawing appear to be genuine T — Yes ; there are some 
such parts artificial. 



APPENDIX. 86 

Will you state to the Committee, from the drawing before you, what 
parts in the specimen purchased are artificial besides the right paddle, and 
which were not therefore honestly represented in the drawing before you ? 
— With the exception of about 13 of them, all the processes of the verte- 
brce and several ribs are artificial. 

These 13 processes of the vertebrce, which you have just described, 
appear upon the drawing to be a part of the genuine remains ? — They are 
not represented as restorations. 

And these processes, which are artificial, are also represented as genuine ? 
— Yes ; all the rest are plaster. The lias surrounding those vertebral pro- 
cesses which I have mentioned as genuine, is also natural ; namely a patch 
of about 20 inches by 4, is real lias ; the rest was made up of plaster 
of Paris with lamp-black, to imitate lias, with cracks and rifts passing 
through the bones ; but T do not say it was done with a view to impose 
upon anybody, or that either Dr. Buckland or Mr. Mantell did mistake 
that portion for lias. 

Suppose you had been called upon to purchase a specimen, an engraving 
of which had been shown to you, separating the artificial from the natural 
parts, should you have been led to suspect that other parts than those 
actually represented as artificial, were really artificial ? — I might perhaps 
have agreed in opinion with the two gentlemen who made the valuation, 
but I am not certain of it. 

That is to say, you would have been misled by a drawing which pre- 
tended to distinguish between the natural and artificial portions of the spe- 
cimens purchased ? — Yes." 

The following two letters from Mr. Hawkins to Dr. Buck- 
land, I extract from the appendix to Mr. Hawkins's work. 

No. 23. 

Clifford Street, Bond Street, June 25, 1834. 
1 received your most condescending favour this morning, 
soon after my arrival in town, for which I am exceedingly obliged and 
grateful. The zeal you evidence to serve me overpowers me, and I beg to 
coincide with every wish that you express and every suggestion. I can 
appreciate the delicate motive which causes you to decline the proposition 
made you of being sole referee, and I shall be very happy to associate 
Mr. Mantell (or any other gentleman you may please to name) with your- 
self upon this occasion, and rest perfectly content whatever be the result-^ 
proud in having my labours numbered and valued by persons so infinitely 
well calculated to the task. Feeling the importance of this business, 
which you so generously undertake, and convinced that its speedy resolu- 
tion is of moment to the honour of our country and the interests of science, 
I hesitate not to place myself entirely at your command, and to follow 
implicitly your directions. 

P.S. I shall remain in town that I may the better follow your instruc- 
tions, which I await, anxiously.

Clifford Street, July 9, 1834. 
Most anxious to effect the final disposition of my Collection 
in the Museum, and conscious of the objections that a large sum of mo- 



36 APPENDIX. 

uey for such kinds of purposes afford the economical — narrow-minded,— 
1 have after much reflection set apart for the Museum only those specimens 
of my Collection which are of primary import to the puhlic — all the Sauri, 
the subjects of my plates, and those of my general Collection, which are 
really co-adjutors, and really important to the Museum. 

And availing myself of your kind advice, I have sent through 
Mr. Forshall my proposals to the Trustees. 

And I have sent the Trustees, with my work, a list of all the 
Sauri, &c. &c., that I propose for the Museum, a copy of which I retain 
for you, with the several prices as well as I remember that the articles have 
cost me, so that there may he no manner of mistake anywhere, and as little 
trouble in the estimation as possible. 

And, moreover, I take the liberty to express how much gratified I 
feel that you and you alone determine the sum that I am to receive for 
that portion of my Collection which goes to the Museum, as I have not 
only every confidence in your judgment, but am sure that you will add 
the more importance to the problem which you condescend to solve, alone. 
The Rev. Prof. Buckland. 

I have quoted from the published Report, evidence prov- 
ing the deceptive effect produced by the plaster of Paris, and 
also, that in the opinion of some highly competent judges, 
the money value of the collection was over-rated. It now re- 
mains for me to put the readers of this Appendix in posses- 
sion of the document which relieved Mr. Hawkins from the 
imputation of " fraud or collusion," or which, at any rate, re- 
lieved the Trustees from the necessity of pressing the inves- 
tigation. This document is in the form of a letter from Dr. 
Buckland, addressed to the secretary, the Rev. J. Forshall. 
I here give it verhaiim, with only the addition of numerals to 
the several paragraphs. 

No. 25. 

Letter from the Rev. Dr. Buckland to the Rev. J. Forshall. 

Oxford, 12 March, 1835. 
My dear Sir, 

In consequence of a letter from Mr. Konig, I called 
last week at the British Museum to examine the amount of restorations 
in plaster, of certain parts of some of the specimens purchased last sum- 
mer of Mr. Hawkins ; and as some misapprehension has gone abroad upon 
this subject, I feel it due both to Mr. Hawkins and myself to request you 
on my behalf to submit the following statement to the Trustees. 

2 
That Mr. Hawkins offered the specimens to the Museum at a 
price to be valued by myself, it being understood that I was to have the 
assistance of Mr. Mantell in the valuation : 

3 
That Mr. Mantell and myself made our estimates separately, and 



APPENDIX. 37 

on comparing- our lists found tbem to agree within jG20 on the value of 
the whole collection : 

4 

That Mr. Hawkins never professed that there were no restora- 
tions of some defective portions of some of the skeletons ; on the contrary, 
I was aware of what he had heen doing : many of the specimens have 
for three or four years past been under my observation, and I have often 
remonstrated against a practice which I could not prevent. On more 
careful examination of the specimens, I find the amount of these restora- 
tions to be much less than I had supposed ; and were I again to value 
the collection, I should fix a larger rather than a smaller price on it. 

6 

The principal restorations are in the largest specimen, which was 
valued only at £200 or 200 guineas ; to obtain such a specimen in a per- 
fect state is all but impossible. 

6 

There has been, therefore, neither fraud nor collusion on the part 
of Mr. Hawkins, nor want of information on my part, as to the fact of 
reparation and restoration of certain broken portions of the skeletons ; 
and provided these restored parts be pointed out (as they assuredly ought 
to* be) by a different colour from the bones which they now resemble, no 
one can possibly be deluded ; the specimens will be much more intelligible 
to the unscientific observer than if the restorations had not been made. 



As erroneous statements have appeared in the papers respecting 
this subject, you are welcome to make any use you think proper of this 
communication.

Mr. Hawkins would have done well had he indicated the amount 
of his restorations in his published plates; but this is a matter which 
affects the purchasers of his book, and not the Trustees of the Museum, 
who, being in possession of the specimens, can so readily remedy the 
existing evil by marking with a different colour the restorations. 
Believe me to be, my dear Sir, 

Always truly your's, 

W. BUCKLAND, 
Rev. J. Forshall, &c. &c. 



If Dr. Buckland, when he sat down to write the above let- 
ter, could have looked forward to the present action, had he 
wished a verdict to be given in my favour, he could not have 
strung together a set of propositions so ruinous to the cause 
of Mr. Hawkins, as those which are contained in this epistle to 
Mr. Forshall. Should the action come to trial, para- 
graphs 2 and 3 of this letter supply the important admissions, 
Jir8t^ that Mr. Hawkins offered to sell his collection without 
naming a price, provided his friend Dr. Buckland might be 
allowed to value it ; and, secondly^ that two valuers being 
appointed, both form as nearly as possible the same estimate 



88 APPENDIX. 

of the money value of the specimens. Tlie great importance 
of the latt&r point, in my justification of the Ubel, depends 
upon this ; — that Dr. Buckland, professing to know of the full 
extent of the plaster of Paris, amves at the same valuation 
as Dr. Mantell who did not know of it. That Dr. Mantell 
had the modelling concealed from him is a legitimate inference 
from the fact, that he, as co-valuer, puts his signature to the 
written estimate sent to Mr. Hawkins, but allows Dr. Buck- 
land to stand alone, when subsequently vindicating Mr. Haw- 
kins from the imputation of vmfair dealing. If Dr. Mantell 
could honestly have joined Dr. Buckland in that vindication, 
he was bound by every principle of justice and honour not to 
remain silent. Not only does he refrain from joining in the 
exculpatory declaration, but it is virtually admitted in the 
course of the enquiry, that he was kept in the dark as to the 
manufacturing process wliich had been going forward. If the 
reader will turn back to the extract at page 30, he will find 
M. Konig stating to the Parliamentary Committee, that imme- 
diately upon his detecting the plaster of Paris, he wrote and 
informed both the valuers of the discovery he had made ; — 
then at page 29 he is asked, *' Do you know whether Dr. 
Buckland and Mr. Mantell ascertained that part was artifi- 
cial } " to which he replies, '^ Dr. Buckland has said he knew 
it was artificial to a great extent," tacitly admitting that Dr. 
Mantell would not make the same assertion ; and on another 
occasion, the same witness remarks, " According to the state- 
ment of "one" of the gentlemen who made the valuation, the 
restoration was not discovered by me." 

Now, if it be true that Dr. Buckland, knew what Mr. Haw- 
kins " had been doing" fi*om his previous intimate acquaint- 
ance with the collection, and from his having remonstrated 
with Mr. Hawkins on the subject of the modelling, he must also 
have known that Dr. Mantell, engaged at Brighton in active 
professional practice, could not have formed this intimacy with 
the specimens, and that he would require to have the modelled 
parts pointed out to him. The most simple method of doing 
this, in the case of the figured specimens, was, for Mr. Hawkins 
to take a pen, or a chalk pencil, and to mark upon a set of his 
lithographic prints, those parts, which, to use the words of a 
member of the Committee, were not honest representations 
of the originals. So far as the valuers were concerned, this 
plan would have obviated all suspicion of intentional decep- 
tion, and why it was not done I leave for Mr. Hawkins or Dr. 
Buckland to explain. As no clew of this sort was put before 
the valuers, and as Dr. Buckland says nothing about Dr. Man- 
tell having any knowledge of the restorations, when he refers 



APPENDIX. 39 

to the close agi'eement in their valuation, he only condemns 
himself, instead of benefitting Mr. Hawkins. 

When Dr. Biickland says in paragraph 4, that Mr. Haw- 
kins never professed there were no restorations, he makes 
use of an evasion so paltry, that every one of honourable 
feeling must blush to see him have recourse to it. The 
charge against Mr. Hawkins is not that he professed there 
were no restorations, but that he pretended in his plates to 
distinguish between the real and manufactured parts of the 
skeletons, by indicating some of the restorations, without in- 
dicating the whole. 

In paragraph 4, Dr. Buckland also states that he finds the 
restorations to be less than he had supposed. Of all the unfor- 
tunate admissions in the letter intended to serve Mr. Haw- 
kins, this is the most fatal and short-sighted. — It lets out the 
important fact, that Dr. Buckland came to no understanding 
with the vender, as to the extent of the modelled portions ; — 
that he did not even take the trouble to put a question to him 
upon the subject, but, that in setting the extravagant price of 
twelve hundred guineas upon the collection, he had nothing 
more than vague supposition to guide him in distinguish- 
ing plaster of Paris from genuine bones, or from natural lias. 
By his own showing, he allows that the natural parts were 
not to be distinguished from those which were manufactured, 
for says the Doctor, " it is not the British Museum who are de- 
frauded, but Mr. Hawkins. I ought to have put a larger 
price upon the collection. — Parts which I set down to a 
somewhat unusual development of the bump of imitativeness 
in my friend, Mr. Thomas Hawkins, I now, to my surprise, 
find to be the handy-work of Dame Nature herself. My es- 
timate therefore was not a bond fide one, and, as a matter of 
justice to Mr. Hawkins, I ought to make a fresh valuation." 

I happen to know upon more definite authority than 
mere rumour, the amount of the sum which Dr. Buckland is 
prepared to swear he would have given Mr. Hawkins over 
and above the sum of twelve hundred guineas, had not he 
(Dr. Buckland) included in his estimate of the collection a 
quantity of genuine remains under a belief that they were 
plaster of Paris. The sum in question is very considerable, 
and I only refrain from naming the amount, because on this 
occasion I purposely avoid going into details, which have 
not already come before the public in another shape. I 
may, however, just remind Dr. Buckland, that unless he 
quotes the name of Dr. Man tell in conjunction with his owii, 
when stating what Mr. Hawkins ought to have received, the 
larger he makes the sum, the greater the amount of culpa- 



40 APPENDIX. 

bility resting on his own shoulders ; because in calling in that 
gentleman to act as co-valuer, he was bound to point out to 
him every part which he (Dr. Buckland) believed to be man- 
ufactured. 

In paragraph 6, Dr. Buckland states that the manufac- 
tured parts ought most assuredly to be indicated by being 
coloured differently to the parts which are genuine. How 
came Dr. Buckland not to request Mr. Hawkins to have this 
done before he and Mr. Mantell visited the collection for the 
purpose of setting a price upon it ? This would have saved 
Dr. Buckland the disagreeable necessity of having to come 
forward, to try to make the public believe that there was 
no foundation for any suspicion of " fraud or collusion." — Be- 
sides which, Mr. Hawldns would have then had the full value 
put upon his specimens, — that is the additional sum which the 
British Museum now owes him, on account of the extraordi- 
nary blunder which Dr. Buckland pretends to have commit- 
ted. The light breaking in upon Dr. Buckland, as to the 
urgent necessity for colouring the spurious portions, nine 
months after he had sent the collection to the Museum, and 
not until Mr. Konig himself happened to discover the condi- 
tion of those portions, can only be regarded as forming one 
of the most singular coincidences on record. 

When Dr. Buckland penned this defence for Mr. Hawkins, 
it is probable that the contents of a letter which he addressed 
to the Trustees a few months previously were not very fresh 
in his recollection, as it will be seen that upon that occasion 
there was no hint given to the Trustees about any want of 
fidelity in the published plates. The letter in question ap- 
pears at p. 440 of the Report. 

No. 26. 
Letter from Rev. Dr. Buckland, to the Trustees of the British Museum. 

Oxford, July 7, 1834. 
My Lords and Gentlemen, 

I heg to inform you that I have received a communica- 
tion from Mr. T. Hawkins, stating that he is anxious to see placed in the 
British Museum his collection of gij^antic fossil reptiles, found in the 
counties of Dorset and Somerset, and that he is ready to sell them to the 
Trustees at any price that I shall name. 

I have declined to act alone, and have proposed that Mr. Mantell 
should assist me in the valuation, in case the matter should he favourably 
regarded by the Trustees. 

I beg leave to state my opinion with respect to this collection, 
that it is absolutely unique, and" that I consider it a matter of very high 
importance to the Museum to get possession of it; it is such as I could 
scarcely have believed it possible to make, and such as could only have 



APPENDIX. 41 

been made under a rare combination of circumstances in one individual, 
which can never occur again. 

The specimens are not only of high value in the estimation of 
men of science, but are also to a great degree intelligible to the unlearned ; 
among them are several, which are in their kind, beyond compare the finest 
and most perfect the world has ever yet produced. I feel it would be an 
honour to the country to have this collection placed in the British Museum, 
and a national discredit if these unique productions of England should be 
purchased for public museums in other countries. 

The specimens offered for sale are all beautifully and most accu- 
rately engraved in a folio volume, just published, by Mr. Hawkins, on Ich- 
thyosauri and Plesiosauri, which may be considered as a catalogue of the 
collection. 

I have the honour to remain, &c. 

WILLIAM BUCKLAND. 



A graphic representation of a specimen, making that speci- 
men appear more perfect than it really is, cannot be a " most 
accurate" engraving of the original. Dr. Buckland on the 
7th July 1834, tells the Trustees that the specimens are most 
accurately engraved in Mr. Hawkins's book, yet twelve months 
afterwards, when Mr. Konig discovers that the drawings are 
inaccurate, Dr. Buckland informs the Secretary, the Rev. Mr. 
Forshall, that Mr. Hawkins would certainly have done well had 
he indicated the amount of his restorations in his published 
plates, but that he (Dr. Buckland) was fully aware of their want 
of fidelity when he arranged the purchase for the Museum, 
and when he referred the Trustees to those plates as forming 
an illustrated catalogue of the collection. This, I think is only 
to be matched by the declaration at the Geological Society, 
and the private letter of advice to Mr. Hawkins. In paragraph 
8, Dr. Buckland tells the Trustees that they are in no way 
aggrieved by the fact of the Saurians not being so perfect 
as they were represented in the plates, because they (the 
Trustees) having paid on behalf of the nation twelve hundred 
guineas, have come into actual possession of the collection, 
and they therefore have only to expose the defects and there- 
by take care that no one is " deluded." 

The collection being safely deposited in the National 
Museum, and the money safely lodged in the pocket of Mr. 
Hawkins, the Trustees must have felt particularly grateful 
to Dr. Buckland, for waiting until that period, and then hint- 
ing to them how desirable it was that they should set their 
faces against every thing in the shape of delusion. Their 
confidence too, in the integrity and impartiaHty of the Doctor, 
must have been wonderfully strengthened by his disapproba- 
tion of his protege's conduct in the sale of the book ; dis- 
posing of the lithographic prints, upon an average, at a shil- 



42 APPENDIX. 

ling each, and yet not giving the purchasers of those prints 
fully to understand that in one of two instances, the said 
prints were not faithful to the specimens they professed to 
represent. But then, as a set-off against this, it was to be 
borne in mind how nobly Mr. Hawkins had acted in the dis- 
posal of the originals ; first offering to sell his collection to 
the British Museum for £4000. But that offer being de- 
clined, and Mr. Hawkins feeling that the speedy getting rid 
of his Saurians, and their transfer to the Museum, was " of 
moment to the honour of his country, and the interests of 
science," offers to let them go at any price that Dr. Buckland 
shall name ; and not only this, but Mr. Hawkins colours 
the artificial to match the real portions so exactly, or rather, 
as it would seem, the real are made to look so like the artifi- 
cial, that his owyi valuer, notwithstanding his long familiarity 
with the specimens, mistakes the one for the other, and does 
not give Mr. Hawkins so much by several hundred pounds, 
as he was fairly entitled to. Then there was the liberality 
of putting the modelled parts into the bargain, without saying 
one word about them, showing that Mr. Hawkins could not 
have been actuated by any mercenary motives, as in that case 
he would naturally have suggested that two Italian savans 
should be entrusted with the forming a separate valuation of 
such parts of the Ichthyosauri as consisted of plaster of 
Paris, the value of the genuine remains being entrusted to 
his own countrymen. For my own part I cannot understand 
why Dr. Buckland should cast a slur upon Mr. Hawkins as 
it respects the sale of his prints, in opposition to the sale of 
his specimens. I admit, says the Doctor, that the Sau- 
rians are not so perfect as they are made to appear, but this 
matter does not affect the Trustees, for as they have posses- 
sion of the collection, they can take care no one shall be 
deluded, by pointing out the imperfections. 

It is very true that it lay in the power of the Trustees to 
issue orders for the artificial parts to have a colour different 
to that of the parts which were genuine, but I wonder it 
should never have occurred to Dr. Buckland, with all his 
fertility of imagination, that the purchasers of the litho- 
graphic prints being the actual possessors of those prints, 
could inspect the Saurians in the Museum, and by the use 
of the same means make their copies agree with the originals. 
If this plan would in some measure deface the prints, the 
same thing may be said of colouring or otherwise marking 
the specimens themselves. I therefore contend that the pur- 
chasers of the specimens, and the purchasers of the prints 
representing those specimens, equally having it in their 



APPENDIX. 



43 



power to take measures to prevent " any one being deluded," 
upon Dr. Buckland's own inductive reasoning, must both be 
placed in one and the same category. Now, the Doctor 
himself puts forward the proposition that Mr. Hawkins may 
justly be called to account by the purchasers of his plates, 
a proposition which he must either admit to embody a fal- 
lacy, or he must come round to my view of the matter, that 
the buyers of the prints have cause to cry out a little, but the 
buyers of the originals cause to cry out much more, the 
difference between them being represented by the difference 
between one pound and one thousand. 

We are told by Mr. Hawkins in one part of his folio vo- 
lume entitled " Memoirs of Ichthyosauri and PlesiosaurV^ 
that there are some mysteries so profound as to require a 
period of a thousand years for their solution ; and I am 
strongly disposed to acquiesce in the philosophy of this 
observation, when I find by the Parliamentaiy Report, the 
Trustees of the British Museum coming to a resolution, that 
the " clear and decided statement of Dr. Buckland," that is, 
the statement I have just been analysing — rendered it unne- 
cessary for them to institute any farther enquiry into the 
circumstances attending the purchase of Mr. Hawkins's fos- 
sils. 

Such of my readers as may have followed me thus far in 
this Appendix, will now understand why Dr. Buckland took 
upon himself to give out that the Editor of the * Magazine of 
Natural History' was on the brink of ruin; and why Mr. 
Lyell foimd him so ready to offer me his services, and so 
willing on Mr. Hawkins's behalf to compromise the action 
upon my giving '' some sort of verbal apology." 

I appeal to the preceding pages in justification of the 
opinion I entertain, and I appeal to the supposed confidence 
with which a person replies to a question at his friend's din- 
ner-table, in justification of my not having kept my lips 
sealed, when the interrogation was put to me. I still think 
the Trustees of the British Museum were not fairly treated 
in the purchase of Mr. Hawkins's fossils, and if Dr. Buck- 
land deems it advisable to prosecute me for thinking so, he 
can make a cat's paw of his friend, and guarantee him his 
expenses to carry on the action. I may be put to a great 
deal of vexatious annoyance and expense, but if a verdict 
even should, under the law of libel, be entered against me, 
will the farthing damages which Dr. Buckland and Mr. Haw- 
kins are looking foi-ward to dividing, — will that farthing, 
I ask, recompense the President of the Geological Society for 
the ordeal he must pass through to obtain it ? He cannot get 
into the witness-box with clean hands, after one day volun- 
teering to mediate for me, and the next to change places with 



44 APPENDIX. 

Mr. Hawkins, and become my prosecutor. Nor do 1 believe 
it would be an easy matter to find a jury willing to attach 
weight to any statements he might depose to on the trial, 
after the duplicity which I have shown him to be capable of, 
and after the equivocal nature of the evidence laid before 
the Committee appointed by the House of Commons, to en- 
quire generally into the affairs and management of the Na- 
tional Museum. 



I shall say but few words by way of apology for having 
gone into the consideration of subjects which have little or 
no relation to the immediate cause of this Appendix being 
issued. The necessity for the publication, as mentioned on 
the cover of the Magazine for December last, arises out of 
matters connected with the late important discovery near 
Woodbridge, — that of monkeys and opossums, or at least their 
fossilized relics, existing in the London clay. I may, how- 
ever, state in general terms, that though neither of the sub- 
jects already touched upon, was alone of sufficient import- 
ance to involve such a measure as the present ; yet, having 
to enter the lists with Mr. Lyell and Prof. Owen, I have 
taken advantage of the opportunity to repel attacks in other 
quarters. Should there happen to be a lover of Natural His- 
tory, who otherwise might have felt well disposed towards 
the Magazine, or the Editor who conducts it, but that he 
has come in contact with Mr. Neville Wood, Mr. Thos. 
Hawkins, or Dr. Buckland, he will ?iow know how to mea- 
sure the amount of importance to which their several state- 
ments or opinions are respectively entitled. No man having 
the slightest pretension to honourable feeling, will allege 
that, privately, to the injury of another, which puhlicly he 
would flinch from avowing, if openly called upon to do so. 
The President of the Geological Society of London is at 
the pains to originate a report, that the Editor of an English 
scientific journal is on the brink of ruin. A channel is put 
before him, in which, if he could, he might be expected to 
offer something like a pretext for having ventured on so in- 
jurious a statement, but not a syllable is advanced either to 
justify or palliate the act. It therefore can only be infen*ed, 
that he resorted to a gratuitous calumny, for purposes which 
the preceding history will have made too readily apparent. 
The. first London-clay mammiferous tooth obtained by 
Mr. Colchester, in the parish of Kingston (there called Ky- 



• 



APPENDIX. 45 

son), close to the town of Woodbridge, in Suffolk, is repre- 
sented by figure 1. The drawing for this engraving ^ 
has been taken from the original specimen, by M. 
Dinkel, a natural-history draughtsman of well-known [ 
celebrity. The view is one looking down upon the 
crown of the tooth ; and the figure is larger by half 
a diameter than the fossil itself. This tooth, imme- 
diately upon its passing from the hands of the finder 
(a lad employed in the quarry), into the possession 
of Mr. Colchester, was shown by that gentleman to 
me ; and Mr. Colchester, upon that occasion, learned from 
my examination of it, that the tooth was that of a mam- 
miferous animal ; I also mentioned to him the high geolo- 
gical value it would possess, if the stratum from which it 
came were really what it appeai'ed to be, a bed of the 
London-clay formation. I should at once have made pub- 
lic the circumstance in the ' Magazine of Natural History ,' 
had it not been that no other fossils were present to aid in 
determining the age of the bed, and under these circum- 
stances I left it in the hands of its possessor, with an un- 
derstanding that at any future time I was at liberty to 
make it known. 

Subsequently to this, Mr. Lyell became acquainted with 
Mr. Colchester through a note of introduction from me ; and 
during an excursion to Suffolk last year, he borrowed this 
tooth for the purpose of showing it to Prof. Owen. When, 
however, it was removed from Mr. Colchester's cabinet it does 
not appear that anything was said by Mr. Lyell about his 
intended publication. The tooth accordingly was taken to 
the College of Surgeons, and Prof. Owen pronounced it to 
belong to one of the " mixed feeders", and ultimately decided 
that it was the tooth of an Opossum of the restricted genus 
Didelphis. Mr. Lyell then went into Scotland, and having 
possession of the tooth, and as he supposed, a knowledge of 
the genus to which it belonged, he resolved to announce the 
discovery at the meeting of the British Association, then 
shortly about to be held at Birmingham. 

Subsequently to Mr. Lyell's going into Scotland, but prior 
to the Birmingham Meeting, a second and much larger mam- 
miferous tooth, with a considerable portion of the jaw re- 
maining attached to it, came through Mr. Colchester into the 
hands of Mr. Searles Wood. This second tooth was found 
in the same quarry as the former one, and upon being shown 
by Mr. Wood to Prof Owen, he compared it with the cor- 
responding tooth of a well-known monkey, with which, as 
Mr. Wood confidently asserts, he pronounced it to be iden- 
tical. (Sec fig. 2.) 



46 



APPENDIX. 



About three weeks after this, but still before 
the British Association met at Birmingham, a 
third mammiferous tooth, (see fig. 3.) but widely 
differing from either of the two former ones, 
w^as obtained by Mr. Colchester, and given by 
him to me, for publication in the Magazine. 
The opportunity of doing this was only what Natural size. 
1 had in common fairness some claim to, because it was I 
who had induced Mr. Colchester to form a collection of 





the fossils from the numerous and rich localities in the 
immediate neighbourhood of his residence, and to whom he 
was indebted for the information that the tooth (No. 1) was 
that of a mammal. 

Mr. Lyell went from Kinnordy, in Scotland, to the meeting 
of the British Association at Birmingham in August, and there 
announced to the Geological section, the discovery of mam- 
miferous teeth in the London- clay of Suffolk ; my own his- 
tory of the third tooth was coming out in the number of my 
journal for the following month (September), but thinking 
that any infonnation on so important a matter, would be ac- 
ceptable to the Geologists assembled at Birmingham, I sent 
down some printed copies of the paper to the Secretary, Prof. 
Phillips, but not until Mr. Lyell had read his paper on the 
tooth (No. 1), and thereby secured to himself the credit of 
being the first to make known so important a step in the 
history of English Geology. 

I now turn to the authenticated reports in the Athenaeum, 
to make an extract from Mr. Lyell's obseiTations upon the 
tooth (No. 1). This fossil has since turned out to be, like 
No. 2, the tooth of a monkey, and not as at first pronounced 
by Prof. Owen, that of an opossum. The passage I shall 
quote is from page 676 of the 'Athenaeum' for September 7, 
1839. 



Nq. 27. 

" Mr. Lyell then mentioned the discovery of the teeth of an opossum 
in the London clay at Kyson, near Woodbridge. This fossil, also 
from the collection of Mr. Colchester, was obtained, together with the 



APPENDIX. 47 

teeth of fish, from the upper part of a bed of sand about ten feet thick, 
which is covered by a mass of London clay about seventeen feet thick. 
The clay is again covered, at a short distance from Kyson, by the red 
crag. Mr. Owen, on seeing this tooth, was clear that it could not be- 
long to any of the decidedly carnivorous or herbivorous animals, but 
rather to some one of the mixed feeders, and having compared it with 
the teeth of the various tribes of quadrupeds included in that division, 
from the shrews to the monkeys, he found it to differ essentially from 
all of them ; and he finally decided that it was marsupial, and one of 
the molars of a Didelphis allied to the Virginian opossum. Mr. Lyell 
immediately requested Mr. Wood and Mr. Colchester to renew their 
search in the same sand at Kyson, and they soon after found there a 
jaw and tooth, which Mr. Owen refers to a quadrumanous animal of 
the genus Macacus. The sand containing these remains is referable 
to the London clay, and this is the first instance of the fossil remains 
of Quadrumana having been found in a deposit of the Eocene period.' 

Now, the tooth, which, in August, Mr. Lyell, on the autho- 
rity of Prof. Owen, publicly stated to " differ essentially" from 
the monkeys, was found by Prof. Owen, in the beginning of 
the following October, not only to be that of a monkey, but 
to belong to one of the most common and best known genera 
of the whole monkey tribe, — the Macacus. 

It would seem that the first charge set on foot against me 
by Mr. Lyell, was, that in publishing the Woodbridge fossil 
No. 3, (which, after a careful comparative examination, I 
had referred to an opossum), I stood indebted to Prof. Ovren 
for what 1 had said respecting it, and that I had made no 
acknowledgement of that obligation, but had appropriated 
as my own, the result of his investigation. This, at least, 
was from what I could gather, the impression left upon the 
minds of other parties from communications made to them 
by Mr. Lyell. Now an imputation of this kind privately 
circulated, or an obscure hint which might admit of such a 
construction, emanating from so high an authority, was about 
the best scheme that could have been devised for doing me 
the greatest possible amount of injury in the fewest words : 
the Editor of a scientific journal, from the nature of his 
oJ05ce, having so frequently in his hands, the unpublished 
observation of others, and thereby being so peculiarly ob- 
noxious to a charge of undue appropriation. 

When Mr. Lyell is taxed with having made the charge 
just alluded to, he evades an explanation by complaining that 
I had referred to the tooth No. 2, in his possession, as be- 
ing like my own, (No. 3), mammiferous, but that I had not 
mentioned the fact of its also being the tooth of an opossum, 
which I ought under the circumstances to have done, having 



48 APPENDIX. 

been privy to Prof. Owen's determination to that effect. Now 
if the comparing a fossil tooth with a series of recent teeth, 
and the giving an opinion as to which of the recent teeth 
most nearly approximated the fossil, had involved in the case 
of a genus so well known as Didelphis, any very profound 
knowledge of comparative anatomy, then (in the absence of 
good reason to the contrary), I might have been blamed for 
the omission. As it was however, if Mr. Lyell felt, as it is to 
be presumed he did, that he should be rendering the state a 
service by lowering me in the estimation of my fellow culti- 
vators of Natural History, and by putting them on their 
guard with respect to me, he surely might have waited until 
I should have committed some act in\ olving a heavier amount 
of culpability than the one which it is admitted he made use 
of to my prejudice. The tooth in Mr. Ly ell's possession, 
which I spoke of as mammiferous, but without saying that it 
was the tooth of an opossum, happened all the time to be 
the tooth of a monkey, and what is more, Mr. Lyell knew 
perfectly well it was the tooth of a monkey, when he penned 
the letter. No. 33, complaining of my not having called it 
the tooth of an Opossum. I felt it somewhat humiliating to 
have seriously to combat an accusation, so absurdly frivolous 
in its nature, although very far from frivolous if viewed in 
relation to the purposes for which it had been called into be- 
ing. In justification of my silence I informed Mr. Lyell 
that one of my reasons for not stating this tooth, (No. 1), to 
be that of an opossum, was, that Prof. Owen himself, ( after 
Mr. Lyell had left for Scotland), suspected the possibility of 
his having mistaken a monkey's tooth for an opossum's, and 
mentioned that suspicion to myself. A monkey's jaw from 
the same locality as the supposed opossum's tooth, having in 
the mean while been brought to him, readily explaining 
why such a suspicion should arise. Prof. Owen upon being 
referred to by Mr. Lyell, and also by myself, most distinctly 
denies that he gave me any caution of the kind, grounding 
the assertion upon the statement that he felt confident the 
tooth, No. 1, was that of an opossum, and that he allowed 
Mr. Lyell to publish it as such at Binningham, upon his au- 
thority. — Now the real point of importance at issue here is, 
that there being a sacrifice of truth on either one side or the 
other, with whom does it rest ? Fortunately there is a document 
accessible which will help to decide this question. I quote 
from the Annals of Natural History, for November, 1839, 
the following passage to which the name of Prof. Owen 
stands as the author. The fossil referred to is the supposed 



APPENDIX. 49 

opossum's tooth, (No. 1), which Prof. Owen now republishes 
as the tooth of a monkey, and of which he thus speaks : 

No. 28. 
" This tooth was one of the mammiferous remains from the Lon- 
don-clay formation at Kyson, which was submitted to my examina- 
tion by Mr. liyell, and the one which, after a cursory comparison, I 
observed to present a considerable resemblance with the molar of an 
opossum. / should not, however, have presumed to have published 
a statement of its affinity to, much less its identity loith the genus 
Didelphis, without testing the fossil by a more extended and rigour- 
ous comparison." 

On the 14th of November (letter 38), Prof. Owen states 
that he could not have communicated to me before he left 
London for Birmingham, an intention to re-compare the sup- 
posed opossum's tooth with the teeth of the monkeys, because 
his first comparison made him feel confident that the tooth in 
question was that of a Didelphis, and as such he allowed 
Mr. Lyell to publish it before the members of the British 
Association ; yet, only fourteen days previously to his WTiting 
this letter. Prof. Owen had declared in print, that his first 
examination of this same tooth was so cursory, that he would 
not have felt justified in publishing its afiinitiesto, and much 
less its identity with the genus Didelphis, The argument, 
therefore, with which Prof. Owen opposes my statement, is 
completely falsified by his own words. 

How Prof. Owen, when at the Birmingham Meetmg, could 
authorize Mr. Lyell to publish that which, by his own volun- 
tary admission, he (Prof. Owen) would not have " presumed" 
to have published himself, is a matter for him, and not for 
me to explain. 

Mr. Lyell who had so committed himself in this matter as 
probably to feel that he must, if necessary, go any lengths in 
making out some case against me, comes forward with a state- 
ment, which for the boldness displayed in its concoction, 
could not well be exceeded. In the letter. No. 35, dated 
Nov. 1st, he deposes as follows : — 

No. 29. 

" Mr. Lyell had conversed at Birmingham with Prof. Owen, on the 
subject of the opossum's tooth, both before reading his paper to the 
British Association and afterwards, and then again in September, at 
the College of Surgeons in London. It was not until three weeks ago 
that Prof. Owen first called on Mr. Lyell to say that he began to en- 
tertain doubts, and to invite Mr. Lyell to accompany him to the Col- 
lege of Surgeons, where, after a careful comparison, it was decided 
that the tooth was not marsupial, but the molar of a Macacus." 



50 APPENDIX. 

RefeiTiiig again to this point in his vindicatory letter, Mr. 
Lyell observes. — 

No. 30. 

" It is impossible, that during my intercourse with Mr. Owen in 
August and September, when conversing on this subject, I should have 
remained ignorant of any doubts entertained by him, of the marsupial 
nature of the tooth. No. 1, which he allowed me to announce on his 
authority, at Binningham. It was six weeks after you wi'ote your pa- 
per, that the suspicion entered Mr. Owen's mind for the first time, and 
he immediately came to tell me that he felt some annoyance at having, 
after his first cursory comparison, misled me." 

The intimation here distinctly conveyed by Mr. Lyell's 
statement, is nothing more or less than that Prof. Owen had 
a month or more at his disposal, during which there was no 
reason to prevent his testing his suspicion, if any doubt had 
existed in his mind as to the possibility of his having made 
a mistake in the matter of the supposed opossum's tooth. 
Mr. Lyell, moreover, making it appear that during this interval 
(that is, the month of September), he (Mr. Lyell), was in per- 
sonal communication at the College of Surgeons with Prof. 
Owen. The real fact, however, is, that during the month of 
September, Prof. Owen was not within a hundred miles of the 
College of Surgeons ; and during the previous month (August), 
Mr. Lyell not having been within a hundred miles of the same 
building, — it was not until the month of October that Prof. 
Owen could put his doubts to the test. The "September" con- 
versations which Mr. Lyell calls in to bear against me, are 
therefore altogether imaginary. 

Feeling how serious an imputation would be thrown upon 
Mr. Lyell by what I have just stated, and the great importance 
to myself of verifying the absence of Prof. Owen, 1 thought 
it as well to address the following letter to the Secretary of 
the College of Surgeons : 

No. 31. 

103, Great Russell Street, Blooms bury, 
May 23rd, 1840. 
Sir, 

I am under the necessity of addressing you as the 
Secretary of the College of Surgeons, for the purpose of obtaining 
(if it can be granted me) a document, which shall put it in my power 
to state, on more definite authority than my own personal knowledge, 
that the Assistant Conservator of the Museum, Prof. Owen, was 
absent from the College during the month of September last. 

The gi'ounds upon which I hope this request will be acceded to are 
these :-^ 



APPENDIX. 51 

That being the Editor of the Magazine of Natural History, a Jour- 
nal in which the subjects of Comparative x\natomy and Physiology, 
in common with other branches of Science are treated upon, I have 
for several years past had occasional access allowed me to the Museum 
of the College, through the Conservator, Mr. Clift, or through the 
Assistant Conservator, Prof. Owen: — That 1 stand charged by Prof. 
Owen with having appropriated, or with having intended to appropriate 
and publish as my own, certain results, arrived at by, and belonging to 
himself, in relation to some extremely important discoveries in the his- 
tory of English Fossil Zoology, — the said charge or charges arising, 
more or less, out of certain interviews between Prof. Owen and myself, 
at the Museum of the College, in the month of August, and certain 
alleged interviews between Mr. Lyell and Prof. Owen, also at the 
College, during the month of September, 1839 : — That the fact of its 
not being possible that the alledged interviews could have taken place 
during the specified time, (namely the month of September), owing 
to the absence of Prof. Owen, is a circumstance of material importance 
in enabling me to substantiate a vindication which I am on the point 
of placing before the pub He. 

I further beg to submit that the charge or charges in question, are 
calculated to be seriously detrimental to my reputation as a private 
individual engaged in scientific pursuits, but more especially as a 
public journalist: — moreover, that the granting the document referred 
to could only operate to the prejudice of Prof. Owen, upon the assump- 
tion that he has charged a visitor to the Museum with acts or inten- 
tions which that document would tend to disprove, — and consequently, 
that the refusal to grant it, would be placing an obstacle in the way of 
an investigation which otherwise might establish the innocence of the 
party upon whom the fraudulent imputation now hangs. 

I remain, Sir, 

Your most obedient Servant, 

Edw. CHARLESWORTH. 
Edmund Belfour^ Esq. 
Secretary to the College of Surgeons. 

Before sending the above letter, I made a personal appli- 
cation to the Secretary (Mr. Belfour), on the subject : and 
though he did not dispute the fact of Prof Owen's being ab- 
sent from the college throughout the month of September, he 
held out to me but little prospect of my intended application 
being acceded to; and up to the present date (May 28th), 
I have received no reply ; a result for which I was not unpre- 
pared. My own knowledge of the period of Prof Owen's 
absence, arises from his ha\'ing told me when he went to 
the Birmingham meeting, that he should proceed thence to 
Ireland, and remain absent during the period in question ; 
in addition to which, I called at the College on the 28th of 
September, and Prof. Owen had not then returned from his 
excursion. Under these circumstances," it could not be 



52 APPENDIX. 

otherwise than that six weeks should elapse before Prof. 
Owen could test the correctness of the doubt which he 
mooted to me ; and Mr. Lyell must have been aware of this, 
when refeiTing to " September" conversations, and when in- 
timating that Prof Owen (really absent in Ireland), was all 
the time within reach both of the Museum in Lincoln's Inn 
Fields, and the fossil which has acquired such distinguished 
notoriety. 

Up to the date of November the 1st, I had not entertained 
the most distant suspicion of Prof Owen having been a paf ty 
to the charge against me by Mr." Lyell ; as I felt conscious 
that no act of mine could have afforded the slightest found- 
ation for any interruption to the friendly intimacy which 
had long subsisted between us ; and the only communication 
on the subject which had passed between myself and the Pro- 
fessor, had given me the full impression that he was indig- 
nant at the course which a third party had been pursuing. 
I was, however, soon to be undeceived. The charge against 
me in the case of the supposed opossum, and which I fully 
thought to have been concocted by Mr. Lyell alone, proving a 
break-down, Professor Owen, in writing to deny that he 
had communicated to me any doubt as to his first determi- 
nation of that fossil, takes the opportunity of reminding me 
that I had intended to rob him of his discovery of the nature 
of the other fossil. No. 2 (the monkey's jaw), but that he had 
learned from me what I was about to do, and had put a stop 
to my intention. After pei-using the contents of this epistle, 
it was impossible that 1 could remain in the dark any longer. 
I saw clearly that I was to be victimized, for having taken a 
part in making known so important a step in tertiary Geology 
as the discovery at Kingston, and my reputation for integiity 
and candour in the pursuit of science to be destroyed : the 
agents resorted to for that purpose, being forgery and false- 
hood, and the most heartless treachery on the pai't of Prof. 
Owen and Mr. Lyell. 1 replied to Prof Owen's letter in a 
way that left it open for him to withdraw his charge, if he had 
expressed that which he did not intend to convey ; but hear- 
ing nothing farther from him, I determined to save both him- 
self and Mr. Lyell the necessity of privately warning other 
parties of my fraudulent propensities, by publishing the cor- 
respondence, and pleading that I was charged with acts and 
intentions which I never had entertained or committed ; thus 
leaving it open to any one who might read the correspond- 
ence, to believe Prof. Owen if they chose, and act accord- 
ingly- It will be seen, upon this determination being made 
known that the Iluntcrian Professor at the College o Sur- 



APPENDIX. 53 

gcons, had not the courage to persist in his charge against 
me, although he well knew I could bring no witnesses to dis- 
prove his accusation. All that I could have relied was 
circumstantial evidence, and the great improbability that if I 
had intended to appropriate the discovery of another party, 
I should have made that party the confidant of my intention. 
Professor Owen however thought it prudent to shift his ground, 
and, like Mr. Lyell, to discuss something which I had either 
really done, or really intended to do ; and Mr. Searles Wood 
having requested me to furnish an osteological description of 
the monkey's jaw, to accompany his announcement of its dis- 
covery. Professor Owen makes, or wishes to make it appear 
that my being about to do this, was what he had to alledge 
against me. He then goes through the farce of collecting 
evidence to show that I was prepared to furnish this descrip- 
tion, and writes a letter to Mr. Wood, deliberately telling him 
that I had denied any such intention. He also informs Mr. 
Wood, that ha\'ing had the civility, as one of the conseiTa- 
tors of the Museum of the College of Surgeons, to tell him 
what tribe of animals the jaw belonged to, neither Mr. Wood 
or any one else had a right to publish a description of that 
fossil but himself, and that he got the fossil in question out of 
my hands, by insisting upon this principle. Now, Mr. Wood 
knew perfectly well, what it was that Prof Owen had charged me 
with, and by what stratagem it was that he (Prof. Owen) had 
the publishing a description which otherwise would have been 
drawn up by myself. He therefore, at once taxes him with 
having shifted his accusation, and at the same time gives him 
to miderstand, that he does not believ^e any such thing took 
place during my visit to the College of Surgeons in August, 
as that originally stated by the Professor to have occurred. 
Prof Owen finding that his position was anything but a 
satisfactory one, and that he was in a fair way of making as 
lame a business of the appropriation story in the case of the 
monkey, as his coadjutor, Mr. Lyell, had done for him in 
the case of the opossum, — judges it the safest plan to make a 
merit of necessity, and to state that he never meant it to be 
understood that 1 intended to do anything either fraudulent 
or dishonourable ; in other words — that the idea of there being 
" fraud" or " dishonour" in one naturalist appropriating the 
discoveries of another, was an idea peculiar to Mr. Wood 
and myself, and not entertained by him. 

I think any one who will read the correspondence, will have 
little difficulty in understanding why Prof. Owen at the 
eleventh hour, volunteered the admission in question. It 
was not a sense of justice to me that called it forth, depend- 



54 APPENDIX. 

ing on his consciousness of my having done nothing fraudu- 
lent or dishonourable, but because he found that he had 
outwitted himself in fabiicating a charge against me which 
he had not the hardihood to abide by, or the tact to defend. 
In proceeding to the correspondence, which includes both 
the charges against me, I shall in this place, merely request 
the readers especial attention to the letters between Prof. 
Owen and Mr. Wood.

Mr. Charlesworth has heard with surprise, that Mr. Lyell, when in com- 
munication with parties to whom Mr. Charlesworth is personally known, 
has attributed to him the appropriation without actnowledgment of infor- 
mation derived from Professor Owen, in reference to a paper in the last 
' Magazine of Natural History.' 

Mr. Charlesworth begs to inform Mr. Lyell that the article in question 
did not embody any information derived either directly or indirectly from 
Professor Owen, Mr. Charlesworth having had an opportunity of satisfying 
himself as to the probable affinities of the fossil forming the subject of his 
paper, without availing himself of the access always readily granted him 
by Mr. Clift and Professor Owen to the osteological collection in the Col- 
lege of Surgeons. Mr. Charlesworth is at a loss to conceive the motive 
that has induced Mr. Lyell to attempt to create an unfavourable prejudice 
against him, but he trusts that he shall be able to satisfy those among his 
friends to whom the matter may have been named, of the entire absence 
of any foundation for the impression which Mr. Lyell has so anxiously 
endeavoured to produce. 

No. 33. 

16, Hart St., Bloomsbury, 

Oct. 30, 1839. 
In reply to Mr, Charlesworth's letter, Mr. Lyell begs to state that he 
believed, and expressed his belief to several friends, that Mr. Charlesworth, 
when he wrote on a mammiferous fossil found at Kyson (in the Sept. No, 
of Mag. of Nat. Histy.), had been already informed that Mr. Owen had 
previously examined the first mammalian tooth discovered at Kyson, and 
that Mr. Owen had given an opinion that it belonged to an opossum, — a 
result which Mr. Lyell had widely circulated. Mr. Lyell also thought 
that Mr. C, when expressly mentioning the first-discovered tooth in ques- 
tion, should have alluded to the circumstance. 

But if Mr. Charlesworth had not become aware of any conclusion pre- 
viously arrived at respecting the first fossil, Mr. Lyell will have great 
pleasure in informing the only friends to whom he has spoken on the sub- 
ject, that he had laboured under a mistake. 

No. 34. 

Mr. Charlesworth has the honour of acknowledging Mr. Lyell's reply to 
his note of yesterday, in which Mr. Lyell remarks that he thinks Mr. 



APPENDIX. 55 

Charlesworth, in referring to the first mammiferous tooth found at Kyson, 
ought to have mentioned the opinion given by Professor Owen respecting 
its marsupial character. 

Mr. Charlesworth felt himself at liberty to refer in his paper to the tooth 
in question, because, he having been the first to detect its mammiferous 
nature and consequent geological importance, had received from its dis- 
coverer, Mr. Colchester, express permission to figure and describe it pre- 
viously to the loan of the specimen being obtained by Mr. Lyell. 

The comparison, however, of the tooth, with a view to its identification 
with an existing mammiferous type, was undertaken by Professor Owen 
at the request of, and whilst the specimen was in Mr. Lyell's possession ; 
and although Mr. Charlesworth certainly was informed of the result of 
the comparison, he at the same time understood that Mr. Lyell himself 
intended to communicate that result at Birmingham, to the British Asso- 
ciation. 

Professor Owen, moreover, previously to his quitting London to attend 
the Birmingham Meeting, intimated to Mr. Charlesworth, that it was his 
intention again carefully to examine the tooth, as he thought it might 
possibly be referable to a genus among the Quadrumana. 

For these reasons Mr. Charlesworth studiously avoided stating that 
Professor Owen had identified the first tooth as belonging to an opossum, 
more especially as he himself had had no share in that identification, and 
consequently no right to publish the circumstance even had no doubt 
existed as to the fact. 

From the tenor of Mr. Lyell's reply, Mr. Charlesworth infers, that Mr. 
Lyell admits, on his part, the having charged Mr. Charlesworth with the 
undue appropriation of information derived from Professor Owen ; but as 
no circumstance named in Mr. Lyell's reply would appear to bear out, or 
even afford a pretext for, such a charge, Mr. Charlesworth still considers 
that the matter requires explanation. 

October 31. 



No. 35. 

Mr. Lyell read, with no small surprise, in a letter from Mr. Charles- 
worth delivered to him this morning, Mr. Charlesworth's allegation that 
" he had studiously avoided stating that Prof. Owen had identified the first 
tooth as belonging to an opossum, because Prof. Owen, previously to his 
quitting London to attend the Birmingham meeting, had intimated to Mr. 
Charlesworth that the tooth in question might possibly be referable to a 
quadrumanous genus." 

Mr. Lyell had conversed at Birmingham with Prof. Owen, on the sub- 
ject of the opossum's tooth, both before reading his paper to the Brit. Assn. 
and afterwards, and then again in Septr. at the Coll. of Surgs. in London. 
It was not till three weeks ago that Prof. Owen first called on Mr. Lyell to 
say that he began to entertain doubts, and to invite Mr. L. to accompany 
him to the Coll. Surgs., where, after a careful comparison, it was decided 
that the tooth was not marsupial, but the molar of a Macacus. 

Accordingly Mr. L. applied to day to Prof. O., and received an answer 
of which the following is a full and exact copy. 

Royal College of Surgeons, 

Nov. 1, 1839. 
My dear Lyell, 

I neither entertained nor expressed at any time previous to 



56 APPENDIX. 

my visit to you on the 10th Oct. last, any other opinion respecting the 
small molar (now proved to be the second molar of a Macactis), than that 
it resembled the molar of an opossum. 

Believe me, 

Very truly your's, 

RICHD. OWEN. 

Mr. Lyell therefore concludes, that Mr. Charlesworth, at some period 
subsequent to the 10th Oct. last, learnt from Prof. O. that his opinion was 
changed respecting the small molar, and Mr. C. must, by a confusion of 
dates, have imagined that he had written his paper in August last, under 
the impression that Mr, Owen had even then arrived at new views. 

Be this as it may, Mr. Lyell has always felt, that in similar circumstances, 
had he been first informed that Prof. Owen and another gentleman of his 
acquaintance had come to the conclusion that they possessed the first 
fossil remain of an opossum from the London clay at Kyson, and were 
about to publish the fact, and if he (Mr. L.), had afterwards obtained ano- 
ther fossil from the same place, which he also believed to be an opossum, 
he should not have felt at liberty to anticipate the announcement of the 
analogous fact, without first communicating his intention to Prof. O. and 
his friend. 

This feeling Mr. L. expressed to Mr. Wood, and afterwards to Mr. Col- 
chester, when begging of him the loan of the opossum's jaw first described 
by Mr. Charlesworth. 

Mr. L. however, is willing to admit Mr. C's explanation, that he did not 
feel at liberty to interfere with the publication of a fact which others had 
arrived at, and also to communicate this explanation to the only person 
to whom he (Mr. L.) has spoken on the subject. 

At the same time Mr. L. takes this opportunity of expressing his con- 
viction, from the tone of Mr. Charles worth's first letter, that the reports 
which Mr. C. had heard of what Mr. L. had said of him, must have been 
misrepresentations or exaggerations. 
10, Hart St., Nov. 1st, 1839. 



No. 36. 

Mr. Charlesworth having quitted London on the morning of the 1st in- 
stant, to spend a week at Charing in Kent, has been unable to acknowledge 
at an earlier period, Mr. Lyell's letter of that date, and to which he now 
hastens to reply. 

The subject of complaint against Mr. Charlesworth seems to resolve 
itself into the commission of a breach of courtesy on his part towards 
Mr. Lyell and Professor Owen, in not having communicated to these gen- 
tlemen his being in possession of, and his being about to publish in the 
September ' Magazine of Natural History,' an opossum's tooth, with a 
fragment of the jaw, obtained from a supposed bed of London clay near 
Woodbridge. 

The accompanying statement (in a separate form), of the circumstances 
Under which Mr. Charlesworth published the fossil in question, and which 
he trusts Mr. Lyell will favour him by perusing, will show how far the 
assumed commission of this minor offence is born out by fact. 

The impression as to the nature of the charge preferred by Mr. Lyell 
against Mr. Charlesworth, upon the minds of Mr. Charlesworth's 
friends, in two separate instances, was widely different from the aspect 
which the matter now wears ; but as the parties were strangers to each 



APPENDIX. 57 

otlier, Mr. Cluirlesworth can hardly imagine that both of them should have 
fallen into the same kind of exagp:eration, or misrepresentation, hut 
would rather conjecture (as Mr. Lyell does not appear disposed to press 
any charge of urulue appropriation)^ that they must have misundersto od 
the substance or the purport of Mr. Lvell's remarks. 
Nov. 9, 1839. 

[Statement accompanying the above letter to Mr. Lyell.J 

Having learned in August last, through my friend Mr. Searles 
Wood, that a mammiferous tooth, found a considerable time 
since in the London clay, near Woodbridge, had been re- 
ferred by Professor Owen to an opossum ; and that a second 
mammiferous tooth, more recently discovered, had also been 
refen-ed by Professor Owen to an existing genus of monkeys ; 
I visited Suffolk, for the purpose of examining the spot which 
had produced these remains, and returned thence the latter 
end of the w^eek preceding that during which the British As- 
sociation met at Birmingham ; bringing with me a third 
mammiferous tooth, obtained subsequently to the two teeth 
already mentioned, and of which the first discovered speci- 
men was in the possession of Mr. Lyell, and the second in 
the possession of Mr. Wood. I had received pennission 
from Mr. Colchester, the discoverer of these remains, to pub- 
lish the third tooth, and I conclude either that the same per- 
mission had been given respectively to Mr. Lyell and to Mr. 
Wood, as it regarded the publication of the first and second, 
or that these gentlemen felt themselves at liberty to make 
that use of the specimens in their possession. I knew Mr. 
Lyell to be either in Scotland, or on his way to Birmingham, 
and Professor Owen I believed to be likewise absent fi-om 
London, as upon my going into Suffolk, he had named to 
me the day on which it was his intention to leave, for the 
purpose of attending the meeting of the British Association. 
Being anxious that a figure and description of the third 
mammiferous tooth should appear in the following number of 
the * Magazine of Natural History,' in which number Mr. 
Wood was about to publish an account of the second, and 
quadriwianous fossil tooth, I lost no time in consulting ( for 
the purpose of comparison), the valuable collection of cra- 
nia in the museum of the Zoological Society ; and having 
determined what appeared to me the affinities indicated by 
the tooth in my possession, I immediately placed it in the 
hands of the artist, there being barely time to have it drawn 
and engraved sufficiently soon to admit of its intended publi- 
cation. I called on the following morning (Saturday), at the 



68 APPENDIX. 

College of Surgeons for a manuscript, which Professor Owen 
had promised to leave out for me (his description of Mr. 
Wood's quadrumanous tooth), and then unexpectedly found 
Professor Owen still in town. In the course of conversation , 
I named to Professor Owen ray having brought up another 
opossum's tooth, which I was going to describe in the suc- 
ceeding number of my Journal, and Professor Owen then 
observed to me that before pronouncing the Jirst fossil tooth 
as positively belonging to an opossum, he intended, when it 
again came into his hands, carefully to compare it with the 
teeth of some quadrumanous genera. I am unable to state 
what were the exact words used by Professor Owen, but his 
remark distinctly implied a suspicion that the Jirst tooth ori- 
ginally referred by him to an opossum, might possibly be the 
molar of a quadnimanous animal ; and at the time, I naturally 
concluded, that this doubt on the mind of Professor Owen, 
originated in his having determined the generic relations of a 
second mammiferous tooth, subsequently submitted to his 
examination, to be undoubtedly quadrumanous. And as it 
appears that the molars of the Quadrumana, and those of the 
opossums, in some instances so nearly resemble, that without 
the most careful examination, they may be mistaken the one 
for the other, a doubt as to whether the first tooth ( of which 
it is admitted no scrupulous compaiison was made), might, 
perhaps, prove to be quadrumanous instead of marsupial, 
would seem almost of necessity to be involved in the subse- 
quent identification of a second tooth, from the same locality 
as the molar of a monkey. However slight this doubt might 
be, upon Professor Owen's return to London in October, the 
Jirst tooth having, in the meanwhile, been again placed in 
his hands, such a comparison was undertaken, when the fossil 
in question proved to be the tooth of a monkey, and not of 
an opossum, as he had originally supposed ; and under the 
circumstances just referred to, it was by no means unlikely 
that my allusion to my intended publication of a second opos- 
sum's tooth should elicit from Professor Owen a casual inti- 
mation of this doubt, although at this distance of time, the 
fact of his having done so may easily have escaped his recol- 
lection. The possibility of any " confusion of dates" on my 
part, is put at once out of the question, by the circumstance 
of my not having seen or communicated with Professor Owen, 
from the 25th of August last, until my arrival in London a 
few days since ; and also the fact of my knowing nothing 
whatever about the new determination of the Jirst tooth, 
until the announcement of that determination in Mr. Taylor's 
journal for the present month. 



APPENDIX. 59 

I have entered into these details, in conseqnence of the 
reply sent by Professor Owen, to a note from Mr. Lyell, a 
copy of which reply Mr. Lyell has favoured me with ; but 
the point involved in that correspondence may be entirely 
lost sight of, without prejudice to the question at issue in the 
discussion which has taken place between Mr. Lyell and 
myself; for as I have already had occasion to state the prin- 
cipal motive, (and one that would have induced the same 
course, in the absence of all other considerations), which led 
me, when describing a false molar in my own possession, as 
the tooth of an opossum, to abstain from mentioning that a 
true molar, in the possession of Mr. Lyell, had been previously 
referred by Professor Owen to the same genus, was to avoid 
the incurring the charge which in that case T deemed it pro- 
bable might be raised against me, of having made public 
information which had privately come to my knowledge, and 
the right of publishing which, under the circumstances, was 
vested in Mr. Lyell. 

I certainly esteem it unfortunate, that Mr. Lyell, when 
communicattng to other parties his unfavourable opinion of 
the course which I pursued, under a fallacious hope that it 
presented no feature which could be seized upon as a handle 
for animadversion, should have so expressen himself, as to be 
understood to impute to me an act of greater culpability than 
the one which I have now been called upon to defend.

Nov. 10, 1839. 
My dear Sir, 

Some correspondence has taken place between Mr. Lyell and 
myself, respecting tlie matter wliich I named to you when I was last at the 
College of Surgeons, in the course of which correspondence I stated to Mr. 
Lyell, that previously to your going to Birmingham, you intimated to me 
a suspicion that the /rsi" discovered tooth from Kingston might possibly 
turn out to be quadrumanous ; from the tenour of your answer to Mr. 
Lyell's enquiry upon this point, INIr. L. supposes that there must have 
been some confusion of dates in my mind, which has led me to entertain 
an erroneous impression. You will, however, probably remember receiving 
a note from me when I arrived in Suffolk, written upon the half of a sheet 
addressed to Mr. Sowerby, Jun., requesting you to forward to my printer, 
or leave out for me your promised notice of the fossil Macacus, and as you 
had mentioned Wednesday lo me as the day on which you proposed to 
quit London, I was surprised to find you at the Museum when I called on 
the Saturday for the manuscript ; I was then on niy way to the wood- 



60 APPENDIX. 

cutters in Fleet Street, with the ])lock on whicli was the drawing of the 
third, and then newly-discovered fragment, and which block I showed to 
you, stating that I considered the fragment as marsupial, and that I was 
about to publish it as such. It was then that the observation fell from 
you to which I have alluded, and of whicli I have as clear a recollection 
as of any one circumstance that ever occurred to me. — You were busily 
occupied at the time, I think, upon your British Association Report, and 
you made no farther enquiries about the specimen, either then or the 
following evening which I spent at your house. 

Considering the relative position in which I and Mr. Lyell have 
stood with respect to each other, and that there has not been on his side 
any disposition shown to make a return for information communicated by 
myself, I do not feel that there was the slightest obligation on my part, to 
open any negociation with him prior the publication of the third fossil 
tooth ; and the opinions which he entertains, ox affects to entertain, upon the 
subject, are therefore a matter of perfectindifference to me, except inasmuch 
as the expression of those opinions may injure me in the estimation of 
others. But as it respects yourself, if you feel (as Mr. Lyell wishes to 
make other parties believe you do), that my part in the transaction involved 
knowingly any one thing that was inconsistent with candour and courtesy, 
that such a feeling should exist, would be to me a source of extreme re- 
gret. The idea of anticipating you in any announcement, never once 
crossed my thoughts, for I all along looked upon the matter as a step in 
English tertiary geology, resting between Lyell and myself; and having, 
so far back as 1837, determined the mammifeious character of the first 
tooth, and examined the deposit to which it belonged, the two really essen- 
tial points in its history, I felt that I had a right to have di finger in the pie ^ 
and seized the opportunity chance threw in my way. The subsequent 
location of the fossil in any one particular genus, was a matter so little 
affecting the abstract importance of the first fact (at least in the case of 
the opossum), that the possibility of a quarrel about priority upon that 
point never occurred to me. I trust that I should never attempt to grasp 
at scientific notoriety at the expense of creating a real foundation for the 
slightest shade of discord between myself and others occupied in similar 
pursuits ; but at the same time, when having a character to deal with like 
Lyell's, I would never shrink when it lay in my power from securing all to 
which I felt myself legitimately entitled. 

I gave Mr. Lyell a letter of introduction to Mr. Colchester, whose 
interest in geology solely had its origin in the friendship existing between 
us ; and having received the greatest assistance and attention from that 
gentleman, Mr. Lyell writes to impress him with the notion that I had 
made a dishonourable use of the fossil, which, on a late occasion, he (Mr. 
Colchester) entrusted to me ; Mr. Lyell's object being (as I think there can 
be little doubt), that Mr. Colchester's future discoveries should pass into 
more conscientious hands. Had the case, as it regards myself, been ever 
so bad, common delicacy should have kept Mr. Lyell from broaching the 
matter to Mr. Colchester, he being one among half-a-dozen of my private 
friends to whom Mr. Lyell had gone with letters of introduction from me ; 
but under the actual attendant circumstances, I look upon the act as so 
utterly despicable, that henceforth, the only respect which I can entertain 
for the author of the ' Principles of Geology,' will be that to which he is 
entitled from the position he occupies in the scientific world. 

I hope, in the event of Mr. Lyell consulting you upon any other 
particular in this disagreeable affair, that the portion of the correspond- 
ence with which it may be connected, may be placed before you, that no

P. S. — Mr. Wood made a mistake about Sir James Alexander ; Mr.

names.

My dear Sir, 

With reference to the tooth which I have lately de- 
scribed as a bicuspid of a Macacus, I can only repeat, that I never sus- 
pected it to belong to a monkey till October last, when, not without some 
feeling of moctification, I went to Mr. Lyell, to confess that 1 had misled 
him by mistaking it for the the tooth of a 'possum. Had the case been as 
you suppose it, I should have warned Mr. L. at Birmingham not to speak 
confidently of a Didelphys. 

The circumstance I best remember connected with your visit to the 
Hunterian Museum in August last, was the painful impression pro- 
duced by my becoming aware of your intention to publish, as your own 
discovery, the quadrumanous nature of the molar which had previously 
been submitted to my examination by Mr. Searles Wood ; but which im- 
pression was in a great degree removed, by the promptness with which you 
yielded to my remonstrance on the impropriety of that step. 

I heartily wish that I had never seen any of these mammiferous teeth, 
or that you had described them in 1837, when you first became acquainted 
with them. 

Believe me, my dear Sir, 

Faithfully your's, 

RICHD. OWEN.

No. 39. 

My dear Sir, 

Our respective impressions as to some of the circumstances 
attending the publication of the London-clay mammiferous remains, ap- 
pear so widely to differ, that I fear it will be of little use for me to tell 
you that I did not intend to publish as my own the discovery of the quad- 
drumanous nature of the molar tooth in the possession of Mr. Wood. 
Had I contemplated the so doing, my communicating (as you intimate 
that I did), that intention to yourself with whom the identification exclu- 



62 APPENDIX. 

sivcly rested, would have been strange in the extreme. I presume, there- 
fore, that your painful impression must have originated in some misconcej)- 
tion which I will not attempt to explain : and still less will I endeavour to 
reconcile your observation as to the necessity there would have been at Bir- 
mingham, for warning Mr. Lyell not to speak confidently of a Didelph/s, 
with your remark in Mr. Taylor's Journal, that your comparison of the 
tooth in question at that time had been so cursory, that you would not 
have considered yourself justified in publishing a statement of even its 
affinities to, much less its identity with the above genus. 

To whatever genus or section among the " mixed feeders" you con- 
ceived it likely, in the absence of the opossums or marsupials generally, 
Mr. Lyell's specimen might be found to appertain, the necessity for warn- 
ing Mr. I.yell as to the indefinite nature of the comparison you had then 
made, must have been equally as urgent as it would have been had your 
doubts been directed towards the group which I specified ; and I cannot 
therefore comprehend the force or bearing of the observation in your 
letter. 

I remain, dear Sir, 

Faithfully your's.

No. 40. 



Mr. Charlesworth encloses to Mr. Lyell a copy of a letter addressed la 
Mr. Charlesworth by Professor Owen, as it contains a statement at variance 
with Mr. Charlesworth 's own account (already in Mr. Lyell's hands), of 
some circumstances connected with the publication of the London clay 
mammiferous remains. 

Mr. Lyell will see that Professor Owen advances a fresh charge against 
Mr. Charlesworth; not, however, of any act committed by Mr. Charles- 
worth, but of one which he intended to commit, had not that intention 
been ifrustrated by Mr. Charlesworth's own communication of it to Pro- 
fessor Owen ! ! ! 

This new charge implicates also Mr. Searles Wood, since Mr. Charles- 
worth could not possibly have claimed the determination of the quadru- 
manous fragment as his own, without that gentleman conniving at, and 
becoming a party to the fraud. 

Before Mr. Charlesworth had seen, or before he had heard of the fossil 
in question, Professor Owen had compared it and pronounced it to be iden- 
tical with an existing Macacus, and upon Mr. Wood's subsequently 
placing the specimen in Mr. Charlesworth's hands, Mr. Charlesworth com- 
municated to Mr. Wood his doubts as to the correctness of Professor 
Owen's identification, and which doubts have since proved to have been 
well founded. 

From the complexion which the affair has now assumea, Mr. Charles- 
worth plainly perceives that a determination has in some quarter been 
formed to affix a stigma of a dishonourable kind to the share which he 
has had in the publication of the London-clay mammiferous fossils ; and 
rather than that a notion of this nature should be privately whispered, 
Mr. Charlesworth thinks it better that the whole subject and correspon- 
dence should be laid before the scientific public.

16, Hart St., Nov. 25, 1839. 
If Mr. Charleswortli should think fit to print certain letters which 
were written to him by Mr. Lyell without any expectation of their being 
made public, Mr, Lyell wishes it to be known that this is done without 
his sanction or participation. 

Mr. Lyell also begs, that in that case the whole correspondence which 
has passed on both sides may be published in full, and that this note may 
be added to the rest. 

No. 42. 

Mr. Charlesworth conceived that the word * correspondence,' as used in 
his letter to Mr. Lyell, of the 18th inst., necessarily referred to the letters 
on both sides, and that it could not be construed as referrible only to " cer- 
tain letters" of Mr. Lyell's. 

Mr. Charlesworth willingly accedes to Mr. Lyell's request respecting the 
including his note of yesterday, with the rest of the correspondence. 

As it regards Mr. Lyell's protest against the publication of the letters 
in question, Mr. Charlesworth has to observe : — 

1st, That the correspondence contains no details of a confidential nature. 

2dly, That Professor Owen, in the ' Magazine of Natural History' for 
April, 1838, spoke of M. Coste (a continental physiologist), as a pretender, 
who sought to appropriate to himself a discovery which had been commu- 
nicated to him by Prof. Owen ; and that Mr. Charlesworth having then 
expressed, as the Editor of the Magazine, his own unfavourable opinion 
of the part apparently transacted by M. Coste, is now himself charged by 
Prof. Owen with the prospective commission of an act involving the same 
culpable violation of principle. 

3dly, If the charge or charges against Mr. Charlesworth be founded on 
truth, Mr. Charlesworth himself is the only party who has [or ought to 
have] anything to fear from the publication of the correspondence, as such 
a publication can only tend to elicit other facts or circumstances connected 
with the matter which may not yet have appeared. On the other hand, 
if the charges are destitute of foundation, Mr. Charlesworth is certainly 
justified in attempting to vindicate himself by the publication of the cor- 
respondence, as well as that of any circumstantial details bearing upon 
the subject, which it may be in his power to advance.

Sir, 

Since I last heard from you, when you an- 
nounced your fixed determination to print the correspondence 
which has passed between us, I have seen your letter to Mr. 
Owen, dated Nov. 10, 1839. In reply to several observations 
therein contained respecting me, I request you to publish the 
following statement. In July, 1839, I was shown, when at 



64 APPENDIX. 

Ipswich, a fossil tooth in the possession of Mr. Wm. Col- 
chester, which he had procured at Kyson about two years 
before, which I recognized as decidedly mammiferous, and 1 
therefore examined attentively the stratum near Woodbridge 
from which it came, in order to make up my mind whether 
the deposit really belonged to the London clay. Being satis- 
fied on this point, I obtained leave from Mr. Colchester to 
take it to town, and to show it to Mr. Owen, who supposed it 
to be the molar of an Opossum. 1 immediately wrote letters 
both to Mr. Colchester and Mr. Wood, who were then resid- 
ing near Woodbridge, begging them to search in the sand at 
Kyson, and endeavour to find other remains of mammalia. 
The result of their search, after they received my letters, was 
the discovery of two other fossils. One of these, which I 
shall call No. 2, was obtained by Mr. Wood, and submitted 
by him to Mr, Owen, who decided that it was the jaw of a 
monkey of the genus Macacus, while the other fossil, which 
I shall call No. 3, was placed by Mr. Colchester in your 
hands. Shortly after this, being in Scotland, I received let- 
ters from Mr. Wood, in one of which he told me that it was 
his intention, jointly with Mr. Owen, to give an account of 
the newly-discovered Macacus, No. 2. I was well satisfied 
to hear of his intention, but it was understood between us, 
that I should reserve to myself the announcement to the Bri- 
tish Association of Mr. Owen's opinion respecting the first 
tooth, as well as of other mammiferous fossils from the Red 
Crag, at Newbourn. You have since stated that you saw the 
Kyson molar two years before (in 1837), in Mr. Colchester's 
collection, and recognized its mammiferous character. I 
have no doubt of the correctness of this statement, but I 
believe that the tooth would have remained unnoticed to this 
hour, and unknown to the scientific world, and I feel sure 
that no other mammiferous remains would have yet been 
discovered at Kyson, but for my visit there in July last. 

At Birmingham, in the last week of August, I com- 
municated to the British Association Mr. Owen's opinion of 
the marsupial nature of the grinder first discovered, or No. 1. 
It was not till after 1 had conversed with Mr. Owen on this 
subject, at Birmingham, that he put into my hands the Au- 
gust' number of the 'Magazine of Natural History,' con- 

' Since writing the above, I have been reminded by Mr. Charlesworth, 
that the printed notices alluded to on the Kyson fossils were from the 
September number of the ' Magazine of Natural History,' although 
copies of them were put into my hands before the end of August, at Bir- 
mingham, and had been sent there in that month by Mr. C. to Professor 
Phillips, for distribution to members of the British Association. 



APPENDIX. 65 

laining not only the notice of himself and Mr. Wood, on the 
Macacus, No. 2, but also a paper of your's, on the fossil, No. 
3, which you announced as a Didelphisy without making any 
allusion to the opinion previously given by Mr. Owen, that 
the fossil, No. 1, belonged to a Didelphis. I told Mr. Owen 
that I thought this uncandid, which led him to state how 
nearly you had anticipated him in the publication of the dis- 
covery of the quadrumanous nature of the fossil. No. 2, and 
that you had only been prevented from so doing by his re- 
monstrance, and his insisting on his right to communicate 
himself to the public the result of his own prior investiga- 
tions, which had already been made known to you. 

A consideration of these circumstances decided me not 
to offer my account of the Kyson and Newboum fossils 
for publication in the ' Magazine of Natural History,' where 
they might otherwise have succeeded Mr. Wood's paper ; 
and I accordingly agreed with Mr. Owen, that an account of 
them should be inserted, with Mr. Taylor's permission, in 
one of the next numbers of the ' Annals of Natural History.' 
It then became desirable that Mr. Owen should compare the 
fossils, Nos. 1 and 3, both then supposed to be marsupial. 
I therefore sent a request to Mr. Colchester, to lend me the 
jaw. No. 3, with which he immediately complied ; and in my 
letter to him, I mentioned that I did not feel satisfied (for 
reasons already explained to you in my letters) with the 
manner in which you had proceeded in regard to the publi- 
cation of No. 3. 

In your letter to Mr. Owen, (Nov. 10, 1839), you reassert 
as a fact, that previously to going to Birmingham, Mr. Owen 
had intimated to you a suspicion that the first discovered 
tooth might turn out to be quadrumanous. This he has posi- 
tively denied, and I repeat my conviction, that you must be 
entirely mistaken on this point, as it is impossible, that 
during my intercourse with Mr. Owen in August and Sep- 
tember, when conversing on this subject, I should have re- 
mained ignorant of any doubts entertained by him, of the 
marsupial nature of the tooth. No. 1, which he allowed me 
to announce on his authority, at Birmingham. It was six 
weeks after you wrote your paper, that the suspicion entered 
Mr. Owen's mind for the first time, and he immediately came 
to tell me that he felt some annoyance at having, after his 
first cursory comparison, misled me. 

T shall now conclude by observing, that whatever difference 
of opinion there may be on other points, there will, I am 
persuaded, be but one opinion as to the propriety of your 
printing this correspondence, and making your Magazine a 



GG APPENDIX. 

vehicle for circulating the details of a priv^ate misunder- 
standing, with which the scientific public is wholly uncon- 
cerned.

Your obedient Servant,

December 15. 

Sir, 

I return you your letter of the llth instant, that before its 
publication you may correct an error occurring in the middle of the second 
page, where the words " August number" should be September number. 
If this error be merely accidental, it can be easily rectified, but if it have 
arisen from a mistaken belief that my paper on the fossil opossum was 
published in August instead of September, that belief will help to explain 
soine passages in your communication to me of November the 1st. 

When I wrote my notice of the fossil No. 3, I knew that whatever 
you might say about the history of No. 1, would, by the Athenaeum re- 
port, have, by some days, priority of record over mine ; and this being the 
case, for reasons which I have fully explained, I thought it better to say 
nothing more of the tooth No. 1, than what I had learned from my own 
examination of that fossil before it quitted Mr. Colchester's cabinet. 
The subsequent result, and my history of the attendant circumstances, 
must, I think, satisfy every one that this course was the right one to pur- 
sue. Before the termination of the Birmingham meeting, I sent to my 
friend Professor Phillips some separate copies of the three communica- 
tions having reference to the discovery at Kyson ; thinking they would be 
distributed and read with great interest by the members of the Geological 
section. I might have affixed a date to my paper, as it was drawn up on 
August the 24th ; and this would have given me an apparent priority over 
your's, which is recorded as read August 28th, but I attached no date to 
my communication, and it therefore can only be referred to in relation to 
the month of September. 

I have received from Professor Owen a statement to be published with 
the rest of the correspondence. Professor Owen, finding that I am 
likely to be able to refute the charge he preferred against me in the letter 
of which I sent you a copy, now labours hard to make it appear that Mr. 
Wood had no right to commit to me the drawing up a description of the 
fragment No. 2, and that this intention of describing the fossil, was the 
one that caused his painful impression. Now the " discovery of the qua- 
drumanous nature" of a tooth, can only mean the finding out that its 
proper location is in the group Quadrumana, as opposed to the Mammalia 
generally. A construction differing from this cannot be forced upon the 
words ; and it is idle for Professor Owen to calculate upon mystifiing the 
whole affair by the extraordinary communication he has sent me, or that 
the palpable inconsistencies between the contents of his first letter to me, 
and the documents which he has subsequently penned, will not be pointed 
out and readily perceived. 

The subscribers and contributors to the ' Magazine of Natural His- 
tory' colistitute the only portion of the public with which I am imme-

diately concerned. How far the giving publicity to a matter so intimately 
associated with the reputation of the individual conducting the Journal 
which they support, may or may not interest them, is a question which I 
must risk. 

Whatever comments I may feel myself called upon to offer upon the 
correspondence itself, or upon any of the circumstances with which 
that correspondence is connected, I disclaim, in resolving upon the in- 
tended publication, any other object than that of openly showing that my 
conduct in relation to so important a discovery as the one at Kyson, has 
not, in my capacity of a public journalist, or that of a private individual, 
presented any features which could justly be seized hold of as affording- 
grounds for animadversion. 

As I did not contemplate the necessity for publication when I com- 
menced this correspondence, you will, perhaps, upon the return of your 
own letter now enclosed, place temporarily in my possession the com- 
munications you have received from me, that I may carefully compare my 
copies with the originals.

Sir, 

You have announced in the advertisement sheet 
of the last Number of your Magazine, your intention to pub- 
lish the correspondence which has passed between us on the 
subject of the extinct mammiferous remains, lately found in 
Suffolk. In the event of your persisting in this course, I beg 
that you will add to that correspondence the present state- 
ment, and subjoined letters. 

In my letter elicited by your's of November 10, 1839,^ I 
allude to the painful impression produced by my becoming 
aware of your intention, in the early part of August last, to 
publish, as your own discovery, the quadrumanous character 
of the fossil submitted to my examination by Mr. S. Wood, 
in the preceding month. 

Your answer, dated November 19th, implied a denial of 
your having entertained any such intention, by reference to 
the improbability of my having been able to frustrate it by 
your own communication of such intention to me. It is 
nevertheless a fact, that you did mean to anticipate my pub- 
lication of that discovery, notwithstanding that you yourself 
declared it to me. 

But I was aware from other sources, that after my exam- 
ination and determination of the fossil in question, you had

procured it from Mr. Wood, and had had illustrative cuts of 
it prepared, having, as Mr. Wood has since informed me, 
undertaken to furnish a description of it to accompany Mr. 
Wood's paper. The wood-cuts of the fossil were ordered by 
you, according to Mr. G. Sowerby, Jun., before the 12th of 
August last, without my knowledge, and without the advan- 
tage which might be derived from my directions. It was not 
until after I had insisted on my right to describe the fossil 
which I had determined, that Mr. Sowerby received directions 
from you (dated 15th August), to call upon me with the proofs 
of those cuts, which were then applied to illustrate my de- 
scription. 

The following are the letters which have passed between 
Mr. Searles Wood and myself on this subject.

Dec. 5, 1839. 
Dear Sir, 

A letter has been drawn from me under the usual confidence 
of private correspondence, by Mr. Charlesworth, which I observe he has 
advertised in the December Number of his Magazine to publish. In that 
letter I allude to the fact, well known both to you and myself, that Mr. 
Charlesworth had entertained the intention of describing the fossil tooth 
and fragment of a jaw of the Macacus, which he received from you in the 
early part of August last, after its quadrumanous nature had been deter- 
mined by me. Mr. Charlesworth now denies that he ever entertained that 
intention, and as such denial implies that I had, without motive or provo- 
cation, wilfully invented a groundless charge against Mr. Charlesworth, I 
am compelled to request from you a statement, whether you have or have 
not reason to believe that Mr. Charlesworth did intend to describe the 
fossil in question, before I insisted on my right to describe what I had 
been the first to determine.

My dear Sir, 

The result of the examination, which, at the end of last 
July you kindly undertook for me, of the Kyson Quadrumanous Remain, 
led me to conclude, that as the jaw was that of a species of monkey which 
is so commonly carried about in this country, it might probably have been 
accidentally introduced into the heap of sand from which it had been 
pifted. I had, therefore, no intention of publicly calling attention to it ; 
I immediately wrote to Mr. Jiyell, telling him of the supposed fossil, and 
also mentioned my fears respecting its genuineness. A few days after- 



APPENDIX. 69 

wards I showed the specimen to Mr. Charlesworth, and upon a first in- 
spection, he assured me it was a genuine fossil, from the circumstance of 
its agreement in colour and general appearance with the supposed opos- 
sum's tooth which he had previously examined in Mr. Colchester's cabinet ; 
and shortly afterwards I was confirmed in the correctness of this opinion, 
hy his pointing out to me in what it difiered from the recent jaw of a 
Macaque which he had at his apartments in Great Russell Street ; this led 
me to detei-mine to publish Mr. Colchester's fossil in the succeeding num- 
ber of the Magazine of Natural History, but as I did not feel at home 
upon the subject of comparative osteology, Mr. Charlesworth undertook to 
furnish an osteological description, to accompany my letter, stating in what 
particulars he believed the Kyson fragment to differ from the corresponding 
part in the existing Macaci. It was, of course, my intention to mention 
in my letter, the obligation I was under to you, for having told me the 
genus to which the fragment belonged, but I cannot admit that any right 
of describing it was vested in you as a consequence of that determination ; 
still, had I known that you entertained the least wish to describe the fossil, 
I would willingly have left it in your hands at the time I first showed it 
you. I think you must be in error, when you say that Mr. Charlesworth 
now denies his intention of describing the jaw; because, under the circum- 
stances I have mentioned, he had my full permission to do so, and the 
illustrations were executed for his own description. I am aware, however, 
that Mr. Charlesworth does deny any intention of claiming, as his own, 
the original determination of its quadrumanous character, and this impu- 
tation I suppose to have originated in some misapprehension.

My dear Sir, 

I beg to thank you for your prompt and obliging answer to 
my note of the 5th December, and to request that I may add it to the 
correspondence which Mr. Charlesworth seems determined to publish in 
his Magazine. I was not aware, until I received your letter, that you had 
mistaken me so far as to suppose that I thought your fossil belonged to a 
recent species. I alluded, at the time of my first comparison, to the pos- 
sibility of such being the case, because we had not, in England, the jaws of 
every known existing Macacus, wherewith to compareit; and to impress upon 
you the necessity of obtaining the most decisive evidence of its disinter- 
ment from the Eocene stratum, in which it had been stated to you to be 
found. In pointing out to you the resemblance of the fossil to the Maca- 
cus radiatus, I wished merely to demonstrate its generic relationship, ad- 
verting, at the same time, not only to the difference in size, but in shape. 

Permit me to add, in reference to the following passage in a letter 
from Mr. Charlesworth to Mr. Lyell, " This new charge implicates Mr. 
Wood, for Mr. Charlesworth could not have claimed the determination 
of the quadrumanous fragment as his own, without that gentleman con- 
niving at, and becoming a party to, the fraud : " that I thoroughly repu-

given utterance to, and that

Becemher llth, 1839. 
My dear Sir, 

If I rightly understand your request it refers to the 
publication of my letter, in which, case you are quite at liberty to 
make that use of it. Indeed I think for my own saie, as well as Mr. 
Charlesworth 's, full publicity had better be given to all the corres- 
pondence that has taken place, unless some other arrangement satisfac- 
tory to all parties should be made. 

Mr. Charlesworth did not show me or consult me about the letter to 
Mr. Lyell, from which you have sent me an extract, but I agree with 
him, that the intention imputed to him in your statement of what oc- 
cuned at the College of Surgeons, between yourself and Mr. C, 
does indirectly implicate me, as Mr. Charlesworth must in that case 
have persuaded me to suppress the fact of my having been in the first 
instance to you with the fossil, and as I am sure no such intention was 
entertained, or even thought of, by either of us. I hope that Mr. 
Charlesworth 's public explanation wdll remove any suspicion of dis- 
honorable motives having influenced either his own or my conduct in 
this matter. 

I remain, my dear Sir, 

Yours truly, 

SEARLES V. WOOD.

My dear Sir 

I beg again to disclaim the imputation of any fraudulent 
or dishonourable motives, either to yourself or Mr. Charlesworth, in his 
intended description of the quadrumanous fossil belonging to you The 
ideas of dishonour and fraud, as connected with that intention, are exclu- 
sively Mr. Charlesworth's. 

I felt hurt when I became aware of his intention, deeming it un- 
friendly, and, as far as I could ascertain the circumstances under which he 
had taken upon himself to describe that fossil, uncandid. On one occasion 
only have I ever suffered an intimation of the annoyance it occasioned me 
to escape my lips. If Mr. Charlesworth was led to suppose that he had 
been the first to discover the extinct character of your quadrumanous

fo?sil, he may have conceived himself justified, having your pennission, in 
publishing as his own, what I again repeat was my discovery. 

I remain.

Faithfully your's,

I now subjoin the following answer from the curator of the 
museum of the Zoological Society, to a question proposed to 
him by me, and quoted by Mr. Waterhouse, in his letter. 

No. 51. 

Zoological Society, December 6, 1839. 
My dear Sir, 

I have hut this moment received your note, and hasten to 
answer your question, whether Mr. Charles worth, in the early part of 
August, did not avail himself of my assistance in comparing the fossil 
tooth described in the 'Magazine of Natural History' for September, 
1839, with the recent quadrumanous crania in the Society's museum. Mr. 
Charlesworth did bring that tooth to the Society for the purpose of com- 
parison. Our specimens of skulls being under lock and key, I got them 
out for him, and he examined them in my presence. I also examined the 
fossil, and compared it with the recent skulls, but I am sure I gave no 
opinion to the effect that the fossil formed part of the jaw of a Macacus. 
I am, dear Sir, 

Faithfully your's 

GEO. R. WATERHOUSE. 

To an enquiry which I made of Mr. G. B. Sowerby, Jun., 
as to the date when Mr. Charlesworth ordered the wood-cuts 
of the quadrumanous fossil, I received the following answer. 

No. 52. 

Dear Sir, 

My only dates respecting the woodcuts Nos. 57 and 58, 
p. 444 and p. 447, in the ' Magazine of Natural History,' which were or- 
dered by Mr. Charlesworth, are very vague, and refer, not to the time of 
the instructions being given, but of the drawings being executed. To the 
best of my knowledge, the magnified figures were drawn on or about the 
12th of August, having been ordered two or three days before, and the 
natural-size figure, the latter end of the same week, or the beginning of 
the following. 

My dear Sir, 

Your's truly, 

G.B. SOWERBY, Jun. 
R. Owen, Esq. 

This is the evidence which leads me to conclude that, had 
not my remonstrance on the subject of publishing my own 
account of Mr. Wood's fossil been eifect^ial, the wood-cuts 



72 APPENDIX. 

of it, executed by your instructions, would liave illustrated 
your description of that fossil instead of mine. 

A few words, now, with respect to your article entitled 
'On the discovery of a portion of Opossum's jaw,' (pp. 448 
and 450, 'Mag. Nat. Hist.,' Sept. 1839). You knew that I 
had previously announced to Mr. Lyell, the existence of a 
marsupial fossil in the London clay : Mr. Colchester and 
Mr. S. Wood were also aware of that fact before you pub- 
lished your ' Discovery.' Moreover, your own conclusion, 
that the jaw which you obtained from Mr. Colchester was 
that of an opossum, is at variance with your description of 
that fossil ; for, if the tooth which you say (p. 450), " appears 
to be the one immediately succeeding the true molars," had 
been what you supposed it, then the fossil could not have 
belonged to the genus Didelphis, for the reasons which I 
have assigned in the ' Annals of Natural History ' for No- 
vember. 

I have reason to believe that you were aware of the general 
result of my comparison of Mr. Colchester's London-clay fos- 
sil molar tooth, submitted to me by Mr. Lyell, in June last, 
before you published your own account of the opossum's 
jaw from the same formation. It is no justification of your 
silence with respect to my previous announcement of a fossil 
marsupial in the London clay, that I was induced to alter my 
opinion of it some time after the publication of your paper. 
I remain. Sir, 

Your obedient Servant, 

mCHD. OWEN.
