Yd happier in my judginent, even than you, 
With your bright transports, fairly may be deemed, 
The wandering Herbalist â€” who clear alike 
From vain and, that worse evil, vexing thoughts. 
Casts, if he ever chance to enter here. 
Upon these uncouth forms a slight regard 
Of transitory interest, and peeps round 
For some rare floweret of the hills, or plant 
Of craggy fountain ; what he hopes for wins. 
Or learns, at least, that 'tis not to be won ; 
Then, keen and eager, as a fine-nosed hound 
By soul-engrossing instinct driven along 
Through wood or open field, the harmless man 
Departs, intent upon his onward quest.

PREFACE. 

This work is not put forward as a completed Flora 
of the Lake District. I have never lived within its 
boundaries, but when I belonged to Yorkshire, now 
twenty years ago, and was engaged upon ' North York- 
shire ' and the ' New Flora of Northumberland and 
Durham,' I several times visited the Lakes and made 
notes upon the plants and their range in altitude, and 
spent the wet days in codifying the widely-scattered 
records of my forerunners in the botanical exploration 
of the district. My collection of notes has been from 
time to time lent to various botanical friends who have 
visited it, and they have entered into the books their 
own observations, and the Rev. W. W. Newbould has 
given me his ever-ready help in copying out at the 
British Museum the stations from some of the books 
to which I could not get access elsewhere. Lately, in 
editing the catalogue of species for Westmoreland and 
Cumberland for the new edition of Watson's ' Topo- 
graphical Botany,' and reading the detailed diary by 
Mr. Watson of his excursions in 1835, from Keswick, 
Kendal, and Shap, which has come into my hands as 
his executor, my interest in the subject has been 
revived, and as it does not seem likely at present to 
stand in the way of anything more complete, I have 
thought it best to publish my collection of notes as 
they stand, especially as the local Societies are now 



IV PREFACE. 

training up a new generation of observers, who cannot 
obtain access to the botanical periodicals and older 
works of a general character, and, even if they could, 
have no fair chance of understanding the gap which, 
from a scientific point of view, separates Watson and 
Borrer from Richardson and Hutton. I have con- 
sidered the district which I have included as extending 
northward and eastward to Allonby, Wigton, Penrith, 
and Tebay, but have not always strictly kept to an 
exact limit in those directions. Broadly speaking, there 
are two wide tracts of country included in Watson's 
Lake Province not here dealt with, the low-lying 
northern half of Cumberland, often called the Plain 
of Carlisle, and the western slope of the Pennine Chain 
through Cumberland and Westmoreland. The Lake 
District, as here treated, is a mountainous tract with a 
distinct physical individuality of its own, and with a 
distinct botanical individuality, both in respect of the 
plants that are present and those that are rare or 
absent, the details of which I have endeavoured here 
to record as faithfully as I could. So many people 
have botanised at one time or another at the Lakes, 
that I doubt not this record will fall into the hands of 
many who will be able materially to modify it and add 
to it, and I shall be glad to receive any notes on the 
further range of species, with a view of using them in 
a new edition.

A FLORA OF THE ENGLISH LAKE 
DISTRICT. 

INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. 

Names and Species-limits. â€” There are at the English Lakes 
just 50 ferns and nearly 850 flowering plants that are thoroughly 
wild, and we may count 100 more if recent introductions be 
included in the estimate. In the sequence, nomenclature, 
and limitation of species, I have followed Watson, so that 
in these points the present work is uniform with ' Cybele 
Britannica,' ' Topographical Botany,' and the earlier editions 
of the London Catalogue, and also with my own former books 
on the botany of the north of England, ' North Yorkshire,' 
and the ' New Flora of Northumberland and Durham.' The 
numbers have been widely used in the distributions of the 
London Botanical Society and the Botanical Exchange Club, 
but they are changed in the last edition of the London 
Catalogue. In this work I have only numbered the species 
that have a reasonable claim to be regarded as wild plants 
of the Lake district. A break in the regular sequence of the 
figures consequently indicates that plants that grow wild 
somewhere else in Britain are not found at the Lakes. 

Classes of Citizenship. â€” These are to be understood as used 
in the same sense as in Watson's ' Cybele Britannica,' where 
they are fully defined and explained. By a ^Native' is 
meant a plant which, so far as present appearances show, 
has established itself quite independently of man's interven-

tion. By a ' Colofiist^ is meant a well-established weed of 
corn-fields and arable land ; by a * Denizen^ a plant that now 
looks quite wild, but may perhaps have been originally intro- 
duced by human agency ; and by an ' AIie?i,' a species estab- 
lished less thoroughly, which, without doubt, has strayed from 
cultivation. The fault of botanists of small experience, or 
sometimes of small conscientiousness, is, that in making local 
catalogues they swell their lists by mixing up these Aliens, 
which are often extremely fugitive in their stations, and 
placing them on a level with the really wild plants. .\s all 
readers of Winch and Watson and the old series of the 
' Phytologist ' are well aware, in the Lake district perhaps more 
than anywhere else in the country, confusion has been made 
in this way. 

Maritime o7id Xeropiiilous Fla?its. â€” A considerable number 
of plants grow only on the seashore. These I have indicated 
by inserting the word ' Maritime ' after the class of citizenship. 
A certain number of others are almost restricted to the lower 
limestone hills which surround on all sides the central slate 
mountains of the Lake district. These latter are catalogued 
as 'Xerophilous.' 

Types of Distributio7i. â€” The types of distribution, as worked 
out by Watson, furnish a ready means of indicating the dis- 
tribution of species through Britain as a whole. The types 
are as follows, viz. : â€” 

1. British Type. â€” Species which are spread at shore-level 
through the length and breadth of the island. 

2. Etiglish Type. â€” Species which have their headquarters 
in the south of England, and become rare and run out in the 
north of England or south of Scotland. 

3. Germatiic Type. â€” Species that have their headquarters 
in the cast of England, and become rare or run out altogether 
in the western counties. 

4. Atlantic Type. â€” Species that have their headquarters in 
Wales and the west of England, and run out eastward. 



INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. 3 

5. Scottish Type. â€” Species that have their headquarters in 
Scotland, and run out in the north of England. 

6. Highland Type. â€” Species that have their headquarters 
in the Scotch Highlands, and grow southward only amongst 
the high mountains of the north of England and Wales. 

7. Intennediate Type. â€” Species that have their headquarters 
in the north of England. 

8. Local Type. â€” Species too local to be classed under any 
of the preceding types. 

The following Table therefore will show at a glance how the 
plants of the Lakes are spread through the rest of Britain, and 
how the Lake flora stands in comparison with that of the 
north-eastern counties : â€”

Broadly speaking, leaving out the local species, we may 
reduce the other types to three, viz. (i.) General (British); 
(2.) Austral (English + Germanic + Atlantic) ; and (3.) Boreal 
(Scottish + Highland + Intermediate) ; and say for Britain as a 
whole, 532 species are general in their distribution, 606 
southern, and 238 northern, and that out of the southern 
species 231, and out of the northern species 125, grow in the 
Lake district. 

Zones of Temperature and Altitude. â€” By ' range ' is meant

range in altitude above sea-level, and by the figures i, 2, 3, 4 
the zones of altitude in which the plant grows in the Lake 
district. For tracing out the vertical range of species, Mr. 
Watson divided the surface of Britain into two ' regions,' and 
six * zones ' of temperature. The two regions he called 
* Agrarian ' and * Arctic' The Agrarian includes the whole 
surface of the island at sea-level, and as far up the hills as 
arable cultivation is possible. This is up to about 600 yards 
above sea-level in the north of England, and 400 yards in the 
Scotch Highlands. All above this belongs to the Arctic 
region, which is so called because its characteristic plants 
have their headquarters within the Arctic Circle, or, at any 
rate, in the north. These two regions he divided each into 
three zones : Super-agrarian, Mid-agrarian, and Infer-agrarian ; 
Super-arctic, Mid-arctic, and Infer-arctic. Of these six zones 
the coldest and the warmest, the Super-arctic and the Infer- 
agrarian, are not represented in the Lake district, but we have 
all the other four. I begin to count from below, and my 
zone I corresponds to Watson's Mid-agrarian zone ; my 
zone 2 to his Super-agrarian ; my zone 3 to his Infer-arctic ; 
and my zone 4 to his Mid-arctic. I give a few notes on the 
local characteristics of these four zones. 

Zone I â€” Mid-agrarian zone of Watson â€” extends at the Lakes 
from coast-level to a height of 900 feet upon the hills. The 
average annual temperature may be estimated at from 45" to 
48Â° Fahr. Its upper limit is marked botanically by the cessa- 
tion of Ulex and fruticose Rubi in the open spaces, of Pyrus 
Mains and Viburnum Opidus in the woods, and of Abuts 
i:;lutinosa and Salix fragilis following up the streams. All the 
larger lakes, Windermere, Derwentwater, Ullswater, Basscn- 
thwaite, Crummock, Wastwater, and Haweswater, are low down 
in this zone, and are more or less surrounded and overtopped 
by thick woods, sometimes planted, but often of native growth, 
/^one 2 â€” Super-agrarian zone of Watson â€” includes that 
portion of the hill-country which lies at an elevation of 



INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. 5 

between 900 and 1800 feet. The average annual temperature 
may be estimated at 42Â° to 45Â°. Its upper limit is marked 
botanically by the cessation of Fteris, Digitalis, Erica, 
Farnassia, and Finguiciila. Above it there are no trees, 
either wild or planted, except a few isolated rowans and junipers 
on the high crags. A great many of the mountain tarns fall 
within the boundaries of this zone. At the Lakes there is 
scarcely any arable cultivation above the Mid-agrarian zone, 
and there are very few houses at a higher level. The notion 
that the little inn at the top of Kirkstone Pass, which is the 
highest regularly inhabited house in the Lake district, is also 
the highest inhabited house in the whole of England, is a 
local myth which is destitute of true foundation. It stands 
at a little under 1500 feet above sea-level, and there are many 
scattered farm-houses on the Pennine chain in Yorkshire, 
Durham, and Northumberland at from 1800 to 2000 feet. 
In Allendale there is a village of considerable size called 
Coal Clough, which stands at from 1650 to 1700 feet in eleva- 
tion. One of the principal characteristics of the Lake 
district, from our present point of view, is that here, broadly 
speaking, cultivation does not reach up to the top of the 
Super-agrarian, but only to the top of the Mid-agrarian zone, 
and that consequently at the Lakes the highest localities of a 
crowd of plants that follow in the footsteps of man are a whole 
zone, or half a zone, below their proper climatic limits, and 
the Super-agrarian flora at the Lakes is materially smaller than 
in the eastern counties. 

Zone 3 â€” Watson's Infer-arctic zone â€” includes a mountain 
belt between 1800 and 2700 feet in altitude, with an average 
temperature of 39Â° to 42Â°. Only the two highest tarns, Red 
Tarn on Helvellyn, and Sprinkling Tarn on the north of 
Scawfell, fall distinctly within the bounds of this zone. The 
rest is bare hill and slate crag, where the Alpine plants, such 
as Oxyria reniformis, Sileneacaulis, Sedum Rhodiola, Saxifraga 
oppositifolia, Saxifraga nivalis, Cerastiian alpirmvi, Hieracium 



6 FLORA OF THE LAKK DISTRICT. 

alpintim and chrysafit/ium, and ThalidriDn alpimiin, have 
their headquarters, and the highest springs of the main peaks, 
bordered witli Montio, C/irysosf>lefiiiiJii, and Stellon'a uliginosa, 
and beds of such mosses as Hypiiuvi coiin/intatuin, Bartratuia 
fojitana, and Bryum pseudo-triquetnivi^ interspersed with 
Cochlear ia alpi/ia, Epilobium alsiiiifoUiiin, Saxifraga aizoides, 
and Saxifraga stellaris. 

Zone 4 â€” Watson's Mid-arctic zone â€” includes the hill-tops 
that reach over 2700 feet, that is to say, the summits of 
Scawfell Pike, Scawfell, Helvellyn, Skiddaw, Bowfell, Great 
Gable, Pillar, Fairfield, Blencathra, Grassmoor, and High 
Street. Here there is nothing but bare rocky hill-top, with 
a very scanty vegetation of any kind. The only two plants 
which at the Lakes are characteristic of this zone are Salix 
herbacea and Carex rigida, which grow on nearly all the hills 
just mentioned, and are the two most decidedly arctic plants 
of the Lake flora. A large number of the other boreal species 
do not ascend into this zone at all, not because they could 
not bear its climate, but simply because there are amongst the 
loose piles of heaped stones no fit stations for them to grow 
in. The Lakes are the only })art of England in which this 
Mid-arctic zone is represented. 

The following Table shows the statistics of the vegetation 
of these climatic zones for Britain as a whole, and for the 
Lake district as compared with the north-eastern counties : â€”

INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. / 

Bibliography of Lakeland Botany. â€” I have given the 
localities for the rare plants classified under their counties, 
C. standing for Cumberland, W. for Westmoreland, and L. for 
Lancashire. As an authority for localities, B. is a contraction 
of my own name. For critical plants a note of admiration 
after the name of the collector means that I have seen and 
compared a specimen from that locality. The following are 
the principal publications that relate to the botany of the 
Lake district, arranged in order of date : â€” 

1688. Lawson, Thomas. The foundation of our knowledge 
of the botany of the Lake district was laid in a list of 150 
plants and their localities, which in this year was sent to Ray 
by Thomas Lawson, of Great Strickland. This was used by 
Ray in the second edition of his Synopsis in 1696, and was 
printed in its entirety in Derham's Life of Ray (in 1718, 
p. 213), and again in the volume of Ray's Life and Letters 
issued by the Ray Society in 1848 (p. 197), with the old 
names translated into their binomial equivalents by Professor 
Babington. Lawson was born in 1630, was educated at Cam- 
bridge, and when of age was ordained minister of the Church 
of England at Rampside, in Low Furness. In 1652 George 
Fox visited the district and was kindly received by Lawson, 
who lent him for a day his church and pulpit. Fox preached 
in it with such effect that Lawson and many of his congrega 
tion became Quakers. He resigned his living and settled 
as a schoolmaster at Great Strickland, where he was much 
esteemed by the Lowthers and other neighbouring gentry. 
He died in 1691, and his grave, with a large tombstone which 
was erected to his memory by one of his pupils, may still be 
seen in a small graveyard, without any meeting-house attached 
to it, at Newbyhead, which belongs to the Friends. A letter 
which he wrote the year before his death to Dr. Richard 
Richardson of Bingley, offering to meet him at Settle for a

religious character, and a later list of plants which he found 
is given in Robinson's 'Natural History of Westmoreland and 
Cumberland,' 1709. Linnreus dedicated to his memory the 
genus Lawsoiiia, of which the well-known Oriental Henna is 
the type ; and Villars named after him Hie?-aciu?n Latvsoni. 

1695. Gibson's edition of Camden's 'Britannia' contains 
plant-catalogues drawn up by Ray, for Westmoreland at pp. 
8 1 7 and 846, for Cumberland at p. 846. They are founded 
mainly on Lawson's notes. In Gough's edition, 1789, the 
Westmoreland catalogue will be found in vol. iii. p. 164, and 
that for Cumberland in vol. iii. p. 206. 

1744. Wilson, John. ' A Synopsis of British Plants in Mr. 
Ray's Method,' 8vo, Newcastle-on-Tyne, contains a trust- 
worthy record of a large number of new localities. Wilson 
was a man in humble circumstances, a stocking-maker, or, 
another account says, a shoemaker, at Kendal. He became 
enthusiastically interested in plants, and educated himself to 
such purpose that he wrote a capital book. There is a good 
story about him in Pulteney's ' Sketches,' of how he was once 
sorely tempted to sell his only cow to buy a copy of 
Morison's ' Historia Plantarum,' and how a benevolent lady 
intervened and made him a present of it. In later life he 
became a teacher of botany, and removed to Newcastle, where 
his book was published. To Lavvson and Wilson we look as 
tlie fathers of Lakeland botany. Robert Brown named in 
\Vilson's memory the genus Wilsonia in Convohulacece. 

1762. Hudson, William, born at Kendal 1730, died in 
London 1793, was the author of the first original flora of 
England in which the binomial nomenclature as invented by 
Linnaeus was applied, and consequently he was the first to give 
to a great many English plants the scientific names by which 
they are now known. The first edition of his ' Flora Anglica ' 
was published in 1762, the second in 1778. He practised for 
many years as an apothecary in London in Panton Street. 
In the winter of 1783 his house and all his collections and 



INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. 9 

library were destroyed by fire, which was beUeved to have 
been caused designedly by a servant to conceal a robbery. 
After this he gave up his practice and removed to Jermyn 
Street, where he died in 1793. His records of localities for 
the Lake district are mostly expressed in general terms. 
Linnaeus named in his memory the genus Hudsonia in 
CistacecB. 

1763. Martyn's ' Plant^e Cantabrigenses ' contains in the 
appendix, pp. 102-105, a list of the plants of Westmoreland, 
arranged under their localities. It is entirely compiled from 
Lawson and Wilson. 

1777. Nicholson and Burns' 'History and Antiquities of 
the Counties of Westmoreland and Cumberland ' contains a 
catalogue of plants for each county. 

1782. In this year William Curtis, the originator of the 
' Botanical Magazine ' and author of ' Flora Londinensis,' 
made a botanical excursion through the northern counties, an 
account of which will be found reprinted in the new series of 
the ' Phytologist,' vol. i. pp. 36, 84, and 108. 

1 787-1793. Withering's 'Botanical Arrangement,' second 
edition, 3 vols., contains a number of stations in the Lake 
district, contributed by Mr. T. J. Woodward of Bungay, who 
visited the Lakes in company with Mr. Crowe of Norwich in 
1 781, and a few more were inserted in this and later editions 
from Mr. Hall, Mr. Atkinson, and the Rev. Mr. Jackson. 
Woodward was one of the most eminent English botanists of 
the Smithian era, and after him the fern-genus Woodwardia 
was named. His contemporary, Goodenough, the mono- 
grapher of the English Carices, was for a few years at the 
end of his life Bishop of Carlisle. His extensive herbarium, 
which was presented to Kew about 1880 by the corporation 
of Carlisle, did not, however, contain any Lake plants 
specially localised. 

1794. Hutchinson's 'History of the County of Cumberland 
and some Places adjacent,' 2 vols., Carlisle, republished in 



lO FLORA OF THE LAKE DISTRICT. 

1805, contains a list of plants drawn up by the Rev. W. 
Richardson of Dacre. He seems to have derived a good 
deal of his information from a Keswick guide of the name of 
Hutton. Neither Richardson nor Hutton had the knowledge 
needful for the task they undertook, and this list, although 
perhaps it may give a useful hint sometimes to a resident 
explorer, is so inaccurate and untrustworthy that I have 
scarcely ever cited it. 

1805. Dawson Turner and Dillwyn. 'The Botanist's 
Guide through England and Wales ' contains a long catalogue 
of both flowering plants and cryptogamia for both counties, 
â€” for Cumberland at p. 143, and for Westmoreland at p. 638. 
The principal contributors of new localities are Turner 
himself, the Rev. John Dodd of Wigton, the Rev. W. 
Wood of Whitehaven, the Rev. J. Harriman of Eglestone, 
and Messrs. Jos. Woods of London and T. Gough of 
Kendal. 

1818. Otley, Jonathan. In this year was published the 
first edition of Otley's well-known guide-book, which contains 
the first good map of the Lake hills, and on which the later 
guide-books are all more or less founded. Otley worked out 
a few fresh plant stations, and though, like Wilson, a self- 
taught man in humble circumstances, he did a great deal 
for the investigation of the geology and physical geography 
of the district. 

1824. Winch, N. J., contributed to the 'Newcastle Maga- 
zine' in 1824 (vol. iii. pp. 494, 530, and 575) a list of the 
plants of Cumberland and their localities, which was reprinted 
as a separate work in 4to in 1833. Winch was a capital 
botanist, and the author of an excellent ' Botanist's Guide 
through the Counties of Northumberland and Durham,' pub- 
lished at Newcastle, in two volumes 8vo, in 1805-1807. The 
younger De Candolle named after him the genus Wiuchia in 
Apocynacecp. 

1832. 'Annals of Kendal,' by C. Nicholson, contains, 



INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. II 

pp. 221-225, an excellent list of the plants of the neighbour- 
hood, drawn up by Mr. T. Gough, which he kindly revised 
for me a few years ago. 

1835. Watson, Hewett Cottrell : 'New Botanist's Guide to 
the Localities of the Rarer Plants of Britain,' vol. i. England 
and Wales; vol. ii. Scotland, and Supplement, 1837. This 
is substantially a new edition, brought up to date, of the 
' Botanist's Guide ' of Turner and Dillwyn. Mr. Watson, 
who died in 1881, devoted himself during a long life to the 
special study of the geography of British plants. His books, 
of which the principal are ' Cybele Britannica ' and ' Topo- 
graphical Botany,' extend over a period of forty years, and in 
the present work I have followed up his methods and used 
his zones of altitude and other generalisations. He stayed 
for some time in the Lake district, in 1833, at Keswick, 
Kendal, and Shap, and made copious notes on the plants, 
which are now preserved at Kew along with his herbarium. 
His observations on the altitudinal range of Lake plants are 
printed in the ' Cybele,' vol. iv. p. 334. 

1835. Woods, Joseph, in Hooker's 'Companion to the 
Botanical Magazine,' vol. i. p. 298, has a long paper called 
'Notes of a Tour in the North of England in 1835,' which 
relates chiefly to the Lakes. He had previously visited the 
district in 1800, 1808, and 1814. He was the author of the 
well-known 'Tourist's Flora,' and was the first to study care- 
fully our indigenous roses, of which he published a monograph 
in vol. xii. of the Transactions of the Linnaean Society. 
Robert Brown named after him the fern-genus Woodsta. 

1836-1872. Hindson, Isaac, of Kirkby Lonsdale, during 
these years worked at the flora of that neighbourhood. His 
manuscript list of localities is now in my possession. 

1842-1854. In the old series of the ' Phytologist ' will be 
found papers that relate to Lake botany, as follows :â€” In 
volume ii., at p. 316, by J. Sidebotham ; at p. 424, by 
Borrer; at p. 375, by G. S. Gibson; and at pp. 422 and 



12 FLORA OF THE LAKE DISTRICT. 

1045, by James Backhouse, the monographer of the British 
Hieracia. In volume v., at p. 26, is a paper by Professor 
J. H. Balfour, and at p. i a catalogue of Gosforth plants by 
Joseph Robson. In the second series there are papers of 
the plants of Humphry Head by Dr. Windsor, in vol. ii. 
p. 257, and Mr. C. J. Ashfield, in vol. v. p. 257. 

1843. Jopling's 'Sketch of Furness and Cartmel' contains 
a list of the plants of the district, drawn up by Messrs. Aiton 
and Wilson. 

1855. Harriet Martincau's ' Guide to the Lakes ' contains 
two lists of plants, one for Windermere and its neighbourhood, 
drawn up by Mr. F. Clowes, and one for Cumberland, drawn 
up by Mr. W. Dickinson. Mr. Clowes, who has long been 
in practice as a surgeon at Bowness, knows the Windermere 
district most thoroughly, and has kindly annotated my note- 
book. Mr. W. Dickinson was a land-surveyor, who had lived 
in the west of Cumberland all his life, and knew every part of 
it most thoroughly. He was a man, Mr. Hodgson tells me, 
of robust constitution, striking appearance, and a first-class 
pedestrian, ardently fond of natural history in every depart- 
ment, especially botany and ornithology. He made a large 
number of careful drawings of Lake plants. Besides this list 
he also published a Cumberland glossary, and a book called 
* Cumbriana,' a collection of humorous anecdotes of the 
yeomen and labourers of the county. He died in 1882 at 
his home at Thorncroft, near Workington, at the age of 
eighty-three. The beautifully illustrated work on ' The Lake 
Country,' by Mrs. E. Lynn Linton, and Black's Guide, also 
make mention of a few additional localities. 

1865. Linton, W. J. 'Ferns of the English Lake Country,' 
with numerous original woodcuts, contains in a cheap, handy 
form a description of all the Lake ferns, and a list, drawn up 
by Mr. Clowes, of the numerous varieties named by Moore, 
Lowe, and others, which have been found in the district. A 
new edition, edited by Mr. J. AL Barnes, has since been 



INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATIONS. I 3 

published. Aspland's * Guide to Grange ' contains a list of 
the ferns and rare plants of that neighbourhood, drawn up by 
Mr. A. Mason. 

1874. Hodgson, Miss Elizabeth, of Ulverstone, wrote an 
excellent paper, called ' North or Lake Lancashire, a Sketch 
of its Botany, Geology, and Physical Geography.' It appeared 
first in Trimen's 'Journal of Botany,' vol. iii. pp. 268 and 296, 
and afterwards separate copies were issued. During many 
years Miss Hodgson was my principal botanical correspondent 
resident in the district. She died at a comparatively early 
age, and the preparation of this paper was her recreation 
during a tedious illness. Before publishing it she sent up her 
herbarium to me to have the names of the plants verified, and 
afterwards presented her collection to the British Museum. 

1 880-1 883. The botanical papers which have appeared in 
the ' Transactions of the Cumberland Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Literature and Science ' are as follows, viz. : In 
vol. V. â€” on the ' Grasses of Mid-Cumberland,' by W. Hodg- 
son ; ' Observations on the Flowering Plants of West Cum- 
berland,' by J. Adair ; ' On the Lichens of Cumberland,' by 
Rev. W. Johnson ; and ' Contributions towards a List of West 
Cumberland Flowering Plants and Ferns,' by the members 
of the Botanical Society of Whitehaven, edited by Mr. Adair. 
In volume vii. â€” ' Contributions towards a List of the Fungi 
growing round Carlisle,' by Dr. Carlyle ; ' Notes of the Flora 
of Ullswater District,' by W. Hodgson ; and ' Additions to the 
List of Flowering Plants of West Cumberland,' by J. Glaister 
and Dr. Leitch of Silloth. To the separate copies of his 
paper on the Ullswater flora, Mr. Hodgson, who I am glad 
to see has just been elected an Associate of the Linnasan 
Society, has added a full catalogue of the species found in 
the district that drains into the lake, and I am further indebted 
to him for looking through my notes before publication, and 
making material additions to the list of localities and local 
names. 



14 FLORA OF THE LAKE DISTRICT. 

Rooke Collection of Botanical Drawings. Mr. Rooke was 
an artist who lived at Whitehaven. He was fond of pedes- 
trian rambles, and made sketches of every object that fell in 
his way. His Series of drawings of Lake plants, which were 
executed with great fidelity, and are bound up in five or 
six volumes, after his death were purchased by J. C. Brown, 
Esq. of Hazel Holme, Whitehaven, in whose possession they 
still remain. 

Miss Wilson's Collection of Botanical Drawings. Miss 
Harriet Wilson has also made a large collection of water- 
colour drawings of Lakeland plants, and kept careful note of 
their stations. She kindly lent me her collection, and I have 
often cited her localities for rarities.

Report for 1880, p. 28, identifies a plant gathered by Mr. 
Bolton King on the stony shore of Ullswater with the Loch 
Leven R. reptans. Long ago Woodward recorded it from 
Coniston Water, but specimens gathered there lately by Mr. 
A. G. More were the var. pseudo-reptans ; and I have also

brance the three first Sundays of August were called " Cherry 
Sundays," and crowds of people assembled to regale them- 
selves, and go out boating on the Lake. At Warnel Hall near 
Sebergham, once the property of the Dentons, stands a fine 
row of black cherry-trees, in comparison with which the Mar- 
tindale trees are dwarfs. Fruit from these is gathered in large 
quantities and sent to Lowther Castle to be made into wine.'

well-known R. laciniatus of gardens in hedges near the Post 
Office at Grasmere, and a form with less decidedly laciniated 
leaves and ascending sepals between Ulverstone and Swarth- 
more Hall. I have dried specimens of all the Lake forms of 
fruticose Ruhi and placed them in the Kew Herbarium.

thwaite Ghyll. The smaller-leaved finely-serrated typical 
rhamnifolius in the lane near the Druidic Circle at Keswick, 
Lodore Woods, and in Borrowdale, at Stonethwaite, and be- 
tween Grange and Castle Crag. I have seen the sub-species 
also at Sawrey, Holme Mill, high up Troutbeck, at Clibburn, 
Lowther, and in the Vale of St. John. There is a form with 
leaves densely hairy beneath, very near the Llanberis iticiir- 
vatus, below Watermillock, where it was shown me by Mr. W. 
Hodgson, and in several other places round Ullswater, and I 
have seen it also at the foot of Haweswater.

of the Lake district about Keswick, Ambleside, Bowness, and 
Coniston, but plentiful enough on the outskirts, in F'urness 
and about Arnside, Kirkby Lonsdale, Milnthorpe, and Penrith. 
I have seen a form with laciniated leaves at Ulverstone on

especially Reicteri, stibcristata, coriifolia, and Watso7it. The 
three forms described by Woods, mida and the two varieties 
of hractescens, were founded on Lake examples. Besides these, 
I have seen fine marginata in the lane between Newby Head 
and Common Holme Bridge. Of the forms with deciduous 
sepals, liiteiiatia, sphcerica^ diimalis, and nrbica are common, 
and Miss Hodgson and I both found fi'ondosa in Furness,

which is absent from Northumberland and Durham, and only 
found in one jjlace in Yorkshire, where the Silurian rocks just 
pass within the bounds of the county, is one of the most 
characteristic notes of the Lake flora. It is quite confined 
to the slate hills, being plentiful on Scawfell, Scawfell Pikes, 
Great End, Lingmell, Great Gable (where it ascends to 950 
yards), Red Pike, Pillar, over Blacksail Pass down to the foot

Sausstirea alpina has been discovered in Cumberland this 
summer (1884) by Mr. W. B. Waterfall near Floutern Tarn. 

The plant recorded from Grange-over-Sands as Diotis 
proves to be Filago germanica. 

Chrysocoma Linosyris. Through the kindness of Professor 
Babington I have seen a specimen gathered in Furness near 
Hampsfield by Mr. W. Nixon of Eccleriggs. 

Agrostis nigra, With., has been found by the Rev. W. \\ . 

Newbould in Furness, near Grange-over-Sands.
